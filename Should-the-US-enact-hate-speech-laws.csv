https://www.freedomforum.org/is-hate-speech-illegal/, Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. Freedom of speech is the bestknown First Amendment freedom. But free speech faces important and often controversial questions especially around hostile or hateful expression commonly referred to as hate speech. But what exactly is hate speech? Is hate speech illegal? Is it protected by the First Amendment? Are there any exceptions? We answer those questions and much more in this guide. In the United States hate speech is not illegal though sometimes hateful speech may lose First Amendment free speech protection for other reasons. To understand the difference let s define hate speech. The United Nations Strategy and Plan of Action on Hate Speech defines hate speech as any kind of communication in speech writing or behaviour that attacks or uses pejorative or discriminatory language with reference to a person or a group on the basis of who they are in other words based on their religion ethnicity nationality race colour descent gender or other identity factor.  So is hate speech any idea or view that is not mainstream? Is it speech that offends or insults a particular person or group? Or must it go further and cause harm to the target? Free speech experts have a variety of views. But U.S. law does not define or limit hate speech. Is hate speech illegal? How does it apply to the First Amendment? Are there any exceptions? httpst.cojkbE77xLaR pic.twitter.comoRBD5lgZCg In the U.S. hate speech is not categorically illegal. But while the First Amendment protects even inflammatory or derogatory speech some types of such speech and some discriminatory abusive or violent behavior can be illegal. Some categories of speech are not protected by the First Amendment and these kinds of speech may overlap with speech considered to be hateful. A few of these are Importantly speech that is not protected by the First Amendment is not judged on the viewpoint expressed but rather based on specific narrow definitions and the direct harm the speech inflicts. Conduct that goes beyond words can be punished. Again this is because some other law has been violated not simply because of the message being conveyed. For example vandalism and graffiti are punished not because of any message or viewpoint expressed but rather because they damage people s property whether it s a spraypainted happy face or a hateful slur. Many federal and state laws prevent discrimination in workplaces and businesses. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission explains that Title VII of the federal civil rights act says Applicants employees and former employees are protected from employment discrimination based on race color religion sex including pregnancy sexual orientation or gender identity national origin age 40 or older disability and genetic information including family medical history. Title II of that law says that businesses are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race color religion or national origin. Each of the fifty states and the District of Columbia has a similar law though they vary in terms of which characteristics are protected and in what situations. Finding a balance between these laws and the First Amendment is often difficult. Antidiscrimination laws protect against acts of discrimination an employer cannot refuse to hire a woman a business owner cannot refuse service to a minority customer but do not allow for punishment where those same employers or business owners simply express their views even if that speech may be offensive or hateful. While the U.S. Supreme Court has held that business owners are not required to express messages that run contrary to their beliefs they are not allowed to simply turn away customers based on those protected characteristics. The federal government and most states have laws criminalizing hate crimes. The Department of Justice explains agency s power to enforce federal hate crimes laws that cover certain crimes committed on the basis of race color religion national origin sexual orientation gender gender identity or disability and also provides an overview of the state laws. Such laws have also been upheld against First Amendment challenges because they punish the criminal act that has occurred not the criminal s beliefs words or other manner of expression. The First Amendment is designed to protect the most speech possible from government interference. Political speech is particularly protected from government regulation so that people are as free as possible to participate in public conversations about how we wish to be governed. Freedom of speech is also designed to protect speech of all viewpoints. Laws that punish one point of view but don t punish other viewpoints referred to as viewpoint discrimination are among the clearest violations of the First Amendment. Laws prohibiting hate speech are almost always considered viewpoint discrimination because they only punish speech that is directed against a certain group. So political speech and speech from viewpoints that might be considered hateful cannot be made illegal. Government bodies sometimes try to make hate speech illegal because officials or legislators disagree with the hateful speech they want to ban but such laws must meet high First Amendment standards and often fail to prove in court that they are consistent with free speech. One example is laws prohibiting cross burning. The Supreme Court struck down a St. Paul Minn. ordinance that criminalized cross burning intended to arouse anger or alarm on the basis of race color creed or religion in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul in 1992 because that law singled out people with particular viewpoints for punishment but didn t punish people who might burn crosses for a different reason or no reason at all. It wasn t the act of burning the cross that was punished but the viewpoint the cross burning expressed. By comparison a Virginia law prohibiting cross burning with an intent to intimidate others was upheld in Virginia v. Black in 2003 because it could be applied to anyone regardless of viewpoint who burned the cross to send a threatening message. Hate speech on college campuses has also proven tricky. Many colleges and universities have codes of conduct designed to limit harassment and make their campuses more welcoming learning environments free from disruption. These codes of conduct sometimes even overtly referred to as speech codes often draw from the 1942 Supreme Court case Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire which created the fighting words exception to the First Amendment for facetoface speech intended to provoke a violent response. In reality these codes often go much further in practice calling their constitutionality into question. In recent years hate speech has proliferated online with social media platforms in particular struggling to balance a commitment to free speech with a desire to maintain decorum. Because the First Amendment does not apply to private businesses platforms like Facebook Instagram YouTube and others can remove users based on the content hateful or otherwise of their posts as long as they comply with their own terms of use. Further they cannot be sued if they decide to let that same content hateful or otherwise remain on the platform because Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act immunizes them from liability based on their users posts.

Negativity should will get less reach than positivity. pic.twitter.com36zl29rCSM RELATED Free speech on social media The complete guide One argument for reconsidering whether hate speech should be legal is that laws to curb hate speech would enable people to feel freer to participate in public conversations without the potential for hateful backlash thereby actually protecting free speech. Such laws could limit the ways hateful speakers shut down or scare others so that they are too afraid to speak. To Thane Rosenbaum distinguished university professor at Touro University hate speech can be objectively identified It s when speech or expression is no longer trying to convey an idea or message but aimed only at shutting others down. For Rosenbaum hate speech is an act of violence to intimidate scare and ensure others are too afraid to participate in conversation. According to Rosenbaum though hate speech is not illegal in the United States it would protect vulnerable and marginalized communities better to limit hateful speech and protests in the United States. Many countries around the world share this view and have laws making hate speech illegal unlike the United States. Hate speech is restricted in Canada Australia the United Kingdom and Germany among others. Laws making hate speech illegal around the world often criminalize hatemotivated speech that incites violence or that harms people s dignity. In a 91 ruling Brazil s Supreme Court has ruled that homophobic hate speech is now punishable by prison. The ruling puts homophobic hate speech at the same legal level as racist hate speech which was already punishable by prison in the country. pic.twitter.comfXUR48BZcb Rosenbaum says The enemy of free speech is no longer the government. It s the people.  However Nadine Strossen former president of the American Civil Liberties Union and New York Law School s John Marshall Harlan II professor of law emerita says because hate is an emotion hate speech is subjective. What one person might consider loving words someone from a different background with different beliefs could see as hate. This makes it difficult if not impossible to regulate. But Strossen says that laws should only limit behaviors not beliefs which requires protecting even abhorrent speech. Strossen and others argue hate speech laws are very blunt tools. Even if wellintentioned where they have been tried in practice they tend to be used to limit the rights of the very people they re designed to protect like those who disagree with government. And they don t successfully limit hateful ideologies. According to Freedom Forum surveys about 6 in 10 Americans know that hate speech is legal under the First Amendment. However about 4 in 10 survey respondents say that preventing hate speech is more important than protecting free speech. About the same number say that hate speech should be illegal. Women people of color and younger people were more likely than older white men to favor limits on offensive or hateful speech. Of survey respondents who would ban hate speech just over half say that hate speech should be illegal because it can expose targeted groups to discrimination abuse or violence. Others who argue for hate speech to be illegal say such speech denies tolerance inclusion and diversity and fosters exclusion. Among those who would ban hate speech most say determinations about what constitutes hate speech should be made at the national level. Five in 10 say the Supreme Court should have the final say about when hate speech is illegal. A small percentage would favor statelevel decisions or local control. Our Where America Stands survey shows that 60 of Americans believe hate speech should remain protected by the First Amendment. Six in 10 Americans say hate speech should remain protected by the First Amendment. Of those about half say hate speech is a matter of interpretation so regulation would lead to selective enforcement by whoever happens currently to be in power. Others say the best response to objectionable speech is more speech or that hate speech standards could change over time. So is hate speech illegal? In short no. The First Amendment protects hate speech from government interference. But if hateful speech happens to fit into an unprotected category of speech it may be punishable by law. Private people and organizations such as social media companies can also make their own decisions about what speech to allow in their spaces. And people can respond to hate speech by speaking out against it and supporting the people it targets. Kevin Goldberg First Amendment specialist for the Freedom Forum contributed to this article.

https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/free-speech-can-be-messy-we-need-it, Earlier this year ACLU attorney Lee Rowland spoke at TedX Reno to debunk some common misconceptions about free speech. Below is an edited version of her talk.  The year 2017 was a hell of a year for the First Amendment. Nowhere was more central to this culture war than the campuses of universities across America including right here at the University of Nevada Reno. Two students found themselves embroiled in the biggest free speech controversies of recent years. Peter Cytanovic became the face of white nationalism when a picture of him snarling holding a tiki torch at the Unite the Right Rally in Charlottesville went viral. On the opposite end of the political spectrum graduate Colin Kaepernick went on to the NFL and used his position to highlight police brutality and racial injustice by taking a knee during the national anthem. Both men became incredibly controversial for their speech. There were calls and campaigns for them to be expelled for their opinions.  3Ciframe20allow3D22autoplay3B20encryptedmedia2220allowfullscreen3D222220frameborder3D2202220height3D223152220src3D22https3A2F2Fwww.youtube.com2Fembed2FQ5No1UWFf03Fautoplay3D126version3D32220thumb3D222Ffiles2Fweb17leerowland560 315.jpg2220width3D22560223E3C2Fiframe3E Privacy statement. This embed will serve content from youtube.com. But regardless of whether you agree with one of them both of them or neither the First Amendment protects both of those men and their opinions from censorship and retaliation by the government. It s becoming more common to call for lower legal protections for speech specifically that we should criminalize hate speech. I hear this from the left a lot. I think many on the left would love a world where Mr. Kaepernick could take a knee without any worry the government would force the NFL to fire him but where a government school would still have the power to expel Mr. Cytanovic. This is a dangerous proposition. I m a progressive. It s not hard for me to choose between white nationalism and racial justice. The first is abhorrent and racist. The other is a demand for equal rights. But what if we gave the government the power to decide which of those men was too hateful to speak? Look at our current president he called Charlottesville marchers very fine people while reserving his ire for Black NFL players whom he called sons of bitches. Your idea of hate speech may not be the government s idea of hate speech. I know mine isn t. But even if you agree with Trump are you sure our next president will agree with your worldview? You shouldn t be. That s why I m a true believer in the First Amendment. I am an antiauthoritarian. And I know that the government has historically wielded its raw power to silence those who speak truth to power. And because I want students everywhere to be able to take a knee without fear of government censorship I know we have to cherish our robust First Amendment even for speech that is hateful. But even though I m a free speech attorney I find many of the common tropes and myths about free speech unsatisfying. I m going to explain why I m a true believer by debunking three of these common myths and in the process hopefully reveal three practical tips for exercising your free speech rights powerfully and strategically. Let s start with one myth we all learned in kindergarten Sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me. Does anyone as an adult actually believe this? It s manifestly untrue. I m a free speech attorney precisely because I believe that words matter. We cannot protect free speech by denying its power. So why on earth do we teach this obvious lie to kids? Because humans can be vicious. And when kids are at the receiving end of taunts we want them empowered not diminished in the face of that injustice. In February notorious troll Milo Yiannopoulos had a planned speech at the University of California Berkeley. Students and others in the community went nuts. There were protests. There were riots. Things were set on fire. The administration canceled his talk. In April there was a repeat except this time it was Ann Coulter. She was going to speak school officials said there would be riots and they canceled her talk. Both of these individuals then spent 2017 identifying as victims of liberal censorship. And my god the media ate it up they got more attention for being silenced than they did for trying to peddle actual substantive views. A goal of professional provocateurs is to provoke the campus community into trying to silence them. Think of campus trolls as schoolyard bullies. Oh their words definitely hurt. But the real question is How do we respond to that hurt? A troll wants you to censor them. It feeds into their power and gives them something to sell. You don t have to play that role. Yes there is power in hateful words. But there is also power in sass in unwillingness to be goaded into a fight or to play the role of censor. But not all words wound in the same way. That brings us to our second myth Hate speech isn t protected by the First Amendment. I often hear younger people say that hate speech isn t protected by the First Amendment. But that s untrue. As President Trump s views of Mr. Kaepernick should make plain hate speech is a flexible concept. Just this week the Spanish government arrested and charged a man with hate speech for calling cops slackers on Facebook. That s what criticizing the government looks like without a First Amendment. Hate speech can easily be redefined as speech that threatens the state. But we shouldn t only protect speech out of paranoia there s an upshot here too. Our history shows the same First Amendment that protects hateful racist speech can be and has been used by civil rights advocates to protect historically vulnerable communities. Charles Brandenburg was an avowed racist convicted of incitement to violence for holding an Ohio Ku Klux Klan rally in the late 1960s. The KKK s lawyers took it all the way up to the Supreme Court arguing his hateful ideas were protected by the First Amendment. The Supreme Court agreed with Brandenburg that his vicious genocidal talk about Jews and Black people was constitutionally protected because it only fantasized about future violence. The court decided that before the government can punish speech there has to be an immediate and specific risk of actual violence to a real person. In a vacuum that result might upset you. But at around the same time NAACP leader and civil rights icon Charles Evers gave a passionate speech advocating a boycott of racist whiteowned businesses. He promised that he d break the damn neck of any activist who broke the boycott. White business owners sued Evers and the NAACP for you guessed it incitement arguing that his violent language had led to riots. But the NAACP looked to that Brandenberg case. Those civil rights leaders appealed all the way to the Supreme Court to be sure that Mr. Evers benefitted from the same rights as a KKK member. And they succeeded. The court boiled it down to this question Are we talking about theoretical future violence or is there an immediate risk of harm to a real person? And while there is nothing equivalent about the KKK and the NAACP from that point of view these cases looked the same. There is reason to be skeptical that the rights extended to a KKK member will actually trickle down to someone like an NAACP leader. The hard truth is that every right in our society first gets distributed to the privileged and powerful. Americans did not get the right to vote at the same time regardless of sex or race. Today your rights during an arrest or your right to carry a gun do not look the same for all races. But would you say the answer to that uneven distribution of rights is to eliminate the very constitutional protections that enable us to fight the government when it violates them? No. Distributing our constitutional rights equally is a process. The First Amendment is no different. It s our job to ensure that everyone benefits from the same level of constitutional protection that our free speech rights are truly indivisible. Our First Amendment is necessary to ensure that those who challenge the government are not silenced but that s not sufficient to ensure justice. We have to do the rest of the work. So are today s students up for it? That brings us to our third and final myth Public schools and universities are governed by the First Amendment. That means they can t just keep hateful people off campus because of their views. That means Black and Jewish students have had to face white supremacists on campus immigrant students have been demonized women have had to endure campus speakers calling feminism a cancer. I guarantee you that most adults don t have to pass by a group of people calling for their extermination on their walk into work. I don t think students are snowflakes. I think you re badasses. When I tell you trying to silence or censor political enemies is wrong it s not because I think it s weak. It s because I think it s unstrategic and strengthens the force of your opponents. But if silencing hateful speech isn t an option what does it look like to be empowered in the face of hate? Learn more about Students Free Speech Rights Sometimes the answer will be in your numbers. In August 2017 a group of altright protesters planned a gathering at Boston Common labelling it the Free Speech Rally. Only dozens of the permit holders showed up. But ringing the Common were 40000 people standing strong against racism. That huge counterprotest sent a powerful message of resistance a blizzard of snowflakes. And it made clear the foolishness of one group trying to own the brand of free speech.  Sometimes all it takes is a single person to make a powerful statement. A few years ago a musician appalled by a KKK rally in his hometown of Charleston didn t bother to try to refute the racist ideas he just followed them around with a sousaphone loudly oompahoompahing along. His message of protest was clear without a single word. The marchers disbanded in short order when forced to peddle their message of hate over a goofy tuba line. I believe in the First Amendment because it is our most powerful tool to keep the government from regulating the conversations that spark change in the world. If you want to keep having conversations that can change the world you should embrace the First Amendment too messiness and all. I hope unpacking these myths has helped reveal some truths about how we can strategically exercise our powerful First Amendment rights Know your history. Know that the same highwater mark that has protected the most vile and hateful speakers has also protected civil rights and antiwar advocates. Don t silence your way out of a debate. Remember that a provocateur wants you to play censor. If you know that a speaker you disagree with or one you believe is dangerous is coming to your campus remember how counterproductive silencing tactics can be. Dance to your own tune. You can decide when to counterprotest when to stage an alternative event and when to ignore ideas unworthy of debate. The very choices you make for confronting or ignoring speech you abhor can become benchmarks for how you handle conflict throughout your life.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States,  Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. 1 While hate speech is not a legal term in the United States the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue Matal v. Tam 2017 the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no hate speech exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speakers viewpoint. 2  In academic circles there has been debate over freedom of speech hate speech and hate speech legislation. 3 Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment including commercial speech fighting words and obscenity. The protection of civil liberties including freedom of speech was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment ratified December 15 1791 provides in relevant part that Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. The Fourteenth Amendment ratified on July 9 1868 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as extending this prohibition to laws enacted by the states. Some limits on expression were contemplated by the framers citation needed and have been defined by the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1942 the issue of group defamation was first most explicitly brought up in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire which surrounded the issue of a Jehovahs Witness Walter Chaplinsky who verbally attacked a town marshal for restricting his use of a public sidewalk to protest organized religion by calling him a damned fascist and racketeer. 4 Later when the court heard Beauharnais v. Illinois 5 establishing the narrow traditional exception to the First Amendment covering those words which by their very utterances tend to inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. 6  About a decade later in 1952 in Beauharnais v. Illinois the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state of Illinoiss group libel law which punished expression attacking the reputation of racial ethnic and religious groups. 7 The defendant was charged for distributing a leaflet that rallied white people in Chicago to halt the further encroachment harassment and invasion of white people their property neighborhoods and persons by the Negro. 8 Going off Chaplinsky the court ruled that since libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech it did not matter that the speech did not incite any direct harm. 4 After the Beauharnais case the Supreme Court developed a free speech jurisprudence that loosened most aspects of the free speech doctrine. 8 Traditionally however if the speech did not fall within one of the categorical exceptions it was protected speech.  In 1969 the Supreme Court protected a Ku Klux Klan members speech and created the imminent danger test to determine on what grounds speech can be limited. The court ruled in Brandenburg v. Ohio that The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. 9  This test has been modified very little from its inception in 1969 though it was itself a modification from the earlier clear and present danger standard. Speech promoting violation of the law may still only be restricted when it poses an imminent danger of unlawful action where the speaker has the intention to incite such action and there is the likelihood that this will be the consequence of that speech. In 1992 in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul the issue of targeting hate speech arose again when a group of white teenagers burned a cross in the front yard of an AfricanAmerican family. The local ordinance in St. Paul Minnesota criminalized symbolic expressions tantamount to fighting words arousing anger on the basis of race among other protected classes. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the Supreme Court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it contravened the First Amendment by focusing on particular groups about whom speech was restricted. Scalia explained that The reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable and socially unnecessary mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey. 10 Because the hate speech ordinance was not concerned with the mode of expression but with the content of expression it was a violation of the freedom of speech. Thus the Supreme Court embraced the idea that speech in general is permissible unless it will lead to imminent violence. a citation needed The opinion noted This conduct if proved might well have violated various Minnesota laws against arson criminal damage to property among a number of others none of which was charged including threats to any person not to only protected classes. In 2003 the Supreme Court decided Virginia v. Black. 11 In a 72 majority opinion written by Justice Sandra Day OConnor the court decided that a law which criminalized public crossburning was unconstitutional. 12 The court noted that the law would be constitutional if the law included an element of specific intent to inspire fear of bodily harm instead of concluding that crossburning is prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. The courts analysis was based upon the First Amendments free speech clause. 6  In 2011 the Supreme Court issued their ruling on Snyder v. Phelps which concerned the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest with signs found offensive by many Americans. Snyder the father of a soldier whose funeral was protested by Phelps church sued Phelps for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The issue presented was whether the First Amendment protected the expressions written on the signs from being the basis for civil liability. In an 8 1 decision the court sided with Fred Phelps the head of Westboro Baptist Church thereby confirming their historically strong protection of freedom of speech. The Court explained speech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political social or other concern to the community or when it is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public. 13  In June 2017 the Supreme Court affirmed in a unanimous decision on Matal v. Tam that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violates the First Amendments free speech clause. The issue was about government prohibiting the registration of trademarks that are racially disparaging. Justice Samuel Alito wrote Speech that demeans on the basis of race ethnicity gender religion age disability or any other similar ground is hateful but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express the thought that we hate. United States v. Schwimmer 279 U. S. 644 655 1929 Holmes J. dissenting. 14  Justice Anthony Kennedy also wrote A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the governments benevolence. Instead our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society. 14  Effectively the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed that there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. 14  In the 1980s and 1990s more than 350 public universities adopted speech codes regulating discriminatory speech by faculty and students. 15 These codes have not fared well in the courts where they are frequently overturned as violations of the First Amendment. 16 Debate over restriction of hate speech in public universities has resurfaced with the adoption of antiharassment codes covering discriminatory speech. 17  The speech that hostile work environment harassment law can prohibit varies case by case and is continually under scrutiny by the courts. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC states that Harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ADEA and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA. Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race color religion sex including pregnancy national origin age 40 or older disability or genetic information. 18 For example in Brown Transport Corp. v. Commonwealth the state of Pennsylvania stated that it was religious harassment to put religious pieces in their employee newsletter and Christianthemed verses on their paychecks. 19 In Olivant v. Department of Environmental Protection the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law found jokes emailed to a workplace department and the judge ruled the jokes to defame and dishonor men and women based upon their gender sexual preference religion skin pigmentation and national and ethnic origin thereby making them illegal. 19  AT T aimed to regulate hate speech starting in the 1960s when various people and groups would connect tape recorders to a phone line and when anyone would call that line the recording would play. 20 These types of phone lines were nicknamed dialahate. 20 This technique was used by extremists groups like the Connecticut branch of the National Socialist White Peoples Party and the Ku Klux Klan. 20 These phone lines proved to be popular as a NeoNazi group in Philadelphia said they received 3800 calls per week in 1973 and a Texas branch of the Ku Klux Klan used this method all the way into 1977. 20 Some phone lines like Let Freedom Ring became popular shows that people would call in to hear a new recording every week much like an early form of a podcast. 20  AT T tried several times to end the dialahate lines but phone companies and regulators said nothing could be done to shut down the recordings and courts protected them under the First Amendment. Eventually AT T required that the operators of the line identify themselves. 20 Between this new AT T policy and the growing expense of having a phone line the dialahate lines came to an end. Many of the groups found new and less expensive ways of promoting their agenda like sending messages through fax machines and digital bulletin boards. Eventually the extremist group would spread their messages through the internet and social media.  In 1992 Congress directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA to examine the role of telecommunications including broadcast radio and television cable television public access television and computer bulletin boards in advocating or encouraging violent acts and the commission of hate crimes against designated persons and groups. The NTIA study investigated speech that fostered a climate of hatred and prejudice in which hate crimes may occur. 21 The study failed to link telecommunication to hate crimes but did find that individuals have used telecommunications to disseminate messages of hate and bigotry to a wide audience. Its recommendation was that the best way to fight hate speech was through additional speech promoting tolerance as opposed to government regulation. 22 23 page needed 
https://www.thefire.org/news/blogs/eternally-radical-idea/hate-speech-laws-backfire-part-3-answers-bad-arguments-against, Assertion Hate speech laws are important for reducing intolerance even if there may be some examples of abuse.  Nadine Strossen U.S. free speech law does allow government to restrict hate speech a term that has no specific legal meaning but is generally used to refer to speech conveying hateful discriminatory ideas in appropriately limited circumstances when the speech directly threatens certain serious imminent harms such as intentional incitement of imminent violence or targeted harassment. However U.S. free speech law appropriately limits government from restricting hate speech solely because of disagreement with or disapproval of a speaker s viewpoint or because of vague fears the speech might indirectly lead to some potential harm at some future time.  Hate speech laws are inherently likely to be enforced in ways that further entrench dominant political and societal groups and that further disempower marginalized individuals and groups. Prior to the 1960 s U.S. law did give government broader discretionary power to punish hate speech and the laws in many other countries continue to do so. I will use the term hate speech laws to refer to these kinds of measures. These laws are often intended to promote important positive goals such as reducing intolerance. In practice though the laws are at best ineffective and at worst counterproductive in actually advancing those goals. For this reason many human rights activists all over the world have opposed hate speech laws noting that they too often are used to silence speakers who oppose government policies or advocate minority group rights even in modern democratic countries.  It is important to understand that hate speech laws are inherently likely to be enforced in ways that further entrench dominant political and societal groups and that further disempower marginalized individuals and groups. This pattern is not a result of occasional abuses of the laws but rather is the inevitable systematic result of any use of such laws given their irreducible vagueness. Just consider the wideranging and even contradictory uses of the epithet hate speech in current U.S. political debates. For example some powerful politicians denounce Black Lives Matter advocacy as hate speech whereas others in turn denounce that very denunciation as hate speech. One person s cherished repudiation of intolerance is someone else s hate speech.  No matter how many synonyms are invoked to try to circumscribe the inherently vague broad and manipulable concept of hate these laws unavoidably vest broad discretion in enforcing authorities. Even when such authorities act in utmost good faith they cannot enforce such unduly vague laws except in accordance with their own subjective values or those of other people. As one would expect in a government where officials are appropriately accountable to their constituents officials are likely to enforce these opentextured laws in accordance with the values of significant community interest groups.  Even when hate speech laws are enforced to punish speech of avowed racists they are not effective in reducing intolerance. There is no correlation between the enforcement of hate speech laws and the reduction of intolerance. For example both during the Weimar Republic and in recent decades Germany has strictly enforced strict hate speech laws. Yet Hitler and his Nazi party rose to power during the Weimar period and today s explicitly racist AFD party has grown dramatically in the recent past. Both periods saw disturbing upsurges in violence against Jews and other minority groups. In the U.S. although much progress remains to be made in reducing intolerance much already has been made since the days of Jim Crow. Yet the constitutionality of hate speech laws was not called into question until the 1960s. In other words the reduction in intolerance accompanied the reduction in government power to suppress hate speech not the opposite. In fact civil rights leaders and historians alike concur that robust speech protection extending even to hate speech was necessary for promoting the racial justice cause local officials routinely wielded any speechrestrictive laws to stifle civil rights advocacy.  Even when authorities act in utmost good faith they cannot enforce such unduly vague laws except in accordance with their own subjective values or those of other people. Again it is important to understand why the foregoing patterns are not merely coincidental or the result of occasional abuses of hate speech laws. Rather such laws inherent features doom them to inefficacy in combating intolerance.  Logically hate speech laws leave three options for those inclined to engage in the targeted speech all of which have negative consequences for reducing intolerance Some hate speech will be driven underground thus reducing opportunities for discovering and dissuading those who purvey or heed it some will be camouflaged in more subtle rhetoric to evade punishment thereby making the speech more appealing to a broader audience and some will remain unchanged or perhaps even ramped up as the speakers seek the publicity that results from suppression efforts.  Committed racists and their supporters are not likely to repudiate their beliefs in response to censorship or punishment but to the contrary may well become more resentful and hardened in their attitudes. Moreover attempts to suppress their ideas inevitably draw more attention to those ideas. This phenomenon is so common that there are multiple terms for it including the Streisand effect which refers to an effort by Barbra Streisand to suppress online photographs of her Malibu beach house which had the direct opposite effect dramatically increasing the number of people who viewed the photographs. The added attention to the targeted hate speech leads to increased sympathy from some quarters including from those who view the speakers as free speech martyrs. For these reasons many hatemongers welcome attempted or actual censorship. Far from muting their ideas such efforts amplify them. For these same reasons experts in combatting intolerance such as the Southern Poverty Law Center oppose efforts to suppress white supremacist speakers or rallies. The SPLC explains that such suppressive efforts might feel morally satisfying but they are strategically counterproductive giving hatemongers the very attention they crave. Committed racists and their supporters are not likely to repudiate their beliefs in response to censorship or punishment but may well become more resentful and hardened in their attitudes. While censorship is an ineffective means to reduce intolerance noncensorial strategies have shown much more promise in doing so. The term counterspeech is often used to describe any speech that counters the ideas and attitudes reflected in hate speech. It can take countless forms and be tailored to myriad particular contexts and purposes including for example proactive education that instills values of tolerance and support for equal human rights for all responsive information and analysis to refute advocacy of discriminatory policies and supportive communications to individuals who have been disparaged by hate speech. Contrary to common misconceptions counterspeech should not be the responsibility of individuals or groups who are targeted by hate speech. Nor should counterspeech be limited to defensive responses to hate speech. Rather all of us who are committed to countering hatred and discrimination should seize every opportunity to proactively advocate tolerance and related values including equality dignity diversity and inclusion.  Many selfdescribed formers former members and even leaders of groups espousing hateful doctrines have been redeemed as they refer to it as a result of exchanges with others who reach out to them with compassion and empathy helping the formers wean themselves away from their hateful ideologies. Such redeemed individuals consistently attest that treating them in a punitive or stigmatizing way in contrast only has an alienating impact. This experience aligns with the increasing support for restorative justice as a more constructive approach to addressing any antisocial conduct than the punitive approach our criminal justice system has traditionally pursued.  Multiple reports by human rights activists in many countries and in international agencies have concluded that counterspeech should be prioritized over censorship. Even though hate speech laws are permitted in these other countries human rights experts have concluded that counterspeech is preferable from a pragmatic perspective. For example the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance which monitors the implementation of the many European hate speech laws recently concluded that in contrast with such laws counterspeech is much more likely to be effective in countering intolerance.  Greg Lukianoff Since the widespread passage of hate speech codes in Europe religious and ethnic intolerance there has gone up. During the same period ethnic and religious tolerance has improved in the United States. At least a dozen Western European countries have hate speech laws many of which run counter to their legal or historical commitments to free speech. But even though those laws have been on the books for years by most measures Western Europe is less tolerant than the U.S. Western Europe as a whole scores 24 on the antisemitism index meaning about 24 of the population harbors antisemitic attitudes even though many of their hate speech laws explicitly prohibit Holocaust denial. In the U.S. with no such laws the antisemitism index is ranked at 10. Censorship doesn t generally change people s opinions but it does make them more likely to talk only to those with whom they already agree. If it were true that hate speech laws reduce intolerance we would expect to see fewer hate crimes where such laws exist. Yet in 2019 in the U.S. there were 2.61 hate crimes per 100000 people while conversely in Denmark there were 8.08 per 100000 people in Germany 10.34 and in the United Kingdom a whopping 157.67. Nor has restricting hate speech prevented the spread of intolerance. In 1986 the U.K. passed a law against words or behaviour likely to stir up racial hatred yet in the 1990s racial tolerance decreased. Despite having hate speech laws since the 1980s Germany is experiencing increased Islamophobia and antisemitism. France passed its Gayssot Act outlawing Holocaust denial in 1990 yet as recently as 2019 it held a 17 antisemitism index score. I don t just believe that cracking down on hate speech failed to decrease intolerance. I think there are solid grounds to believe that it helped increase it. After all censorship doesn t generally change people s opinions but it does make them more likely to talk only to those with whom they already agree. And what happens when people only talk to politically similar people? The welldocumented effect of grouppolitical polarization takes over and the speaker who may have moderated her belief when exposed to dissenting opinions becomes more radicalized in the direction of her hatred.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States%23Societal_implementation,  Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. 1 While hate speech is not a legal term in the United States the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue Matal v. Tam 2017 the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no hate speech exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speakers viewpoint. 2  In academic circles there has been debate over freedom of speech hate speech and hate speech legislation. 3 Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment including commercial speech fighting words and obscenity. The protection of civil liberties including freedom of speech was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment ratified December 15 1791 provides in relevant part that Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. The Fourteenth Amendment ratified on July 9 1868 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as extending this prohibition to laws enacted by the states. Some limits on expression were contemplated by the framers citation needed and have been defined by the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1942 the issue of group defamation was first most explicitly brought up in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire which surrounded the issue of a Jehovahs Witness Walter Chaplinsky who verbally attacked a town marshal for restricting his use of a public sidewalk to protest organized religion by calling him a damned fascist and racketeer. 4 Later when the court heard Beauharnais v. Illinois 5 establishing the narrow traditional exception to the First Amendment covering those words which by their very utterances tend to inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. 6  About a decade later in 1952 in Beauharnais v. Illinois the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state of Illinoiss group libel law which punished expression attacking the reputation of racial ethnic and religious groups. 7 The defendant was charged for distributing a leaflet that rallied white people in Chicago to halt the further encroachment harassment and invasion of white people their property neighborhoods and persons by the Negro. 8 Going off Chaplinsky the court ruled that since libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech it did not matter that the speech did not incite any direct harm. 4 After the Beauharnais case the Supreme Court developed a free speech jurisprudence that loosened most aspects of the free speech doctrine. 8 Traditionally however if the speech did not fall within one of the categorical exceptions it was protected speech.  In 1969 the Supreme Court protected a Ku Klux Klan members speech and created the imminent danger test to determine on what grounds speech can be limited. The court ruled in Brandenburg v. Ohio that The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. 9  This test has been modified very little from its inception in 1969 though it was itself a modification from the earlier clear and present danger standard. Speech promoting violation of the law may still only be restricted when it poses an imminent danger of unlawful action where the speaker has the intention to incite such action and there is the likelihood that this will be the consequence of that speech. In 1992 in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul the issue of targeting hate speech arose again when a group of white teenagers burned a cross in the front yard of an AfricanAmerican family. The local ordinance in St. Paul Minnesota criminalized symbolic expressions tantamount to fighting words arousing anger on the basis of race among other protected classes. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the Supreme Court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it contravened the First Amendment by focusing on particular groups about whom speech was restricted. Scalia explained that The reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable and socially unnecessary mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey. 10 Because the hate speech ordinance was not concerned with the mode of expression but with the content of expression it was a violation of the freedom of speech. Thus the Supreme Court embraced the idea that speech in general is permissible unless it will lead to imminent violence. a citation needed The opinion noted This conduct if proved might well have violated various Minnesota laws against arson criminal damage to property among a number of others none of which was charged including threats to any person not to only protected classes. In 2003 the Supreme Court decided Virginia v. Black. 11 In a 72 majority opinion written by Justice Sandra Day OConnor the court decided that a law which criminalized public crossburning was unconstitutional. 12 The court noted that the law would be constitutional if the law included an element of specific intent to inspire fear of bodily harm instead of concluding that crossburning is prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. The courts analysis was based upon the First Amendments free speech clause. 6  In 2011 the Supreme Court issued their ruling on Snyder v. Phelps which concerned the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest with signs found offensive by many Americans. Snyder the father of a soldier whose funeral was protested by Phelps church sued Phelps for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The issue presented was whether the First Amendment protected the expressions written on the signs from being the basis for civil liability. In an 8 1 decision the court sided with Fred Phelps the head of Westboro Baptist Church thereby confirming their historically strong protection of freedom of speech. The Court explained speech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political social or other concern to the community or when it is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public. 13  In June 2017 the Supreme Court affirmed in a unanimous decision on Matal v. Tam that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violates the First Amendments free speech clause. The issue was about government prohibiting the registration of trademarks that are racially disparaging. Justice Samuel Alito wrote Speech that demeans on the basis of race ethnicity gender religion age disability or any other similar ground is hateful but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express the thought that we hate. United States v. Schwimmer 279 U. S. 644 655 1929 Holmes J. dissenting. 14  Justice Anthony Kennedy also wrote A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the governments benevolence. Instead our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society. 14  Effectively the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed that there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. 14  In the 1980s and 1990s more than 350 public universities adopted speech codes regulating discriminatory speech by faculty and students. 15 These codes have not fared well in the courts where they are frequently overturned as violations of the First Amendment. 16 Debate over restriction of hate speech in public universities has resurfaced with the adoption of antiharassment codes covering discriminatory speech. 17  The speech that hostile work environment harassment law can prohibit varies case by case and is continually under scrutiny by the courts. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC states that Harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ADEA and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA. Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race color religion sex including pregnancy national origin age 40 or older disability or genetic information. 18 For example in Brown Transport Corp. v. Commonwealth the state of Pennsylvania stated that it was religious harassment to put religious pieces in their employee newsletter and Christianthemed verses on their paychecks. 19 In Olivant v. Department of Environmental Protection the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law found jokes emailed to a workplace department and the judge ruled the jokes to defame and dishonor men and women based upon their gender sexual preference religion skin pigmentation and national and ethnic origin thereby making them illegal. 19  AT T aimed to regulate hate speech starting in the 1960s when various people and groups would connect tape recorders to a phone line and when anyone would call that line the recording would play. 20 These types of phone lines were nicknamed dialahate. 20 This technique was used by extremists groups like the Connecticut branch of the National Socialist White Peoples Party and the Ku Klux Klan. 20 These phone lines proved to be popular as a NeoNazi group in Philadelphia said they received 3800 calls per week in 1973 and a Texas branch of the Ku Klux Klan used this method all the way into 1977. 20 Some phone lines like Let Freedom Ring became popular shows that people would call in to hear a new recording every week much like an early form of a podcast. 20  AT T tried several times to end the dialahate lines but phone companies and regulators said nothing could be done to shut down the recordings and courts protected them under the First Amendment. Eventually AT T required that the operators of the line identify themselves. 20 Between this new AT T policy and the growing expense of having a phone line the dialahate lines came to an end. Many of the groups found new and less expensive ways of promoting their agenda like sending messages through fax machines and digital bulletin boards. Eventually the extremist group would spread their messages through the internet and social media.  In 1992 Congress directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA to examine the role of telecommunications including broadcast radio and television cable television public access television and computer bulletin boards in advocating or encouraging violent acts and the commission of hate crimes against designated persons and groups. The NTIA study investigated speech that fostered a climate of hatred and prejudice in which hate crimes may occur. 21 The study failed to link telecommunication to hate crimes but did find that individuals have used telecommunications to disseminate messages of hate and bigotry to a wide audience. Its recommendation was that the best way to fight hate speech was through additional speech promoting tolerance as opposed to government regulation. 22 23 page needed

There is no legal definition of hate speech under U.S. law just as there is no legal definition for evil ideas rudeness unpatriotic speech or any other kind of speech that people might condemn. Generally however hate speech is any form of expression through which speakers intend to vilify humiliate or incite hatred against a group or a class of persons on the basis of race religion skin color sexual identity gender identity ethnicity disability or national origin. 1 In the United States hate speech is protected by the First Amendment. Courts extend this protection on the grounds that the First Amendment requires the government to strictly protect robust debate on matters of public concern even when such debate devolves into distasteful offensive or hateful speech that causes others to feel grief anger or fear. The Supreme Courts decision in Snyder v. Phelps provides an example of this legal reasoning. Under current First Amendment jurisprudence hate speech can only be criminalized when it directly incites imminent criminal activity or consists of specific threats of violence targeted against a person or group. For the purposes of collecting statistics the FBI has defined a hate crime as a criminal offense against a person or property motivated in whole or in part by an offender s bias against a race religion disability sexual orientation ethnicity gender or gender identity including skin color and national origin. Hate crimes are overt acts that can include acts of violence against persons or property violation or deprivation of civil rights certain true threats or acts of intimidation or conspiracy to commit these crimes. The Supreme Court has upheld laws that either criminalize these acts or impose a harsher punishment when it can be proven that the defendant targeted the victim because of the victims race ethnicity identity or beliefs. A hate crime is more than than offensive speech or conduct it is specific criminal behavior that ranges from property crimes like vandalism and arson to acts of intimidation assault and murder. Victims of hate crimes can include institutions religious organizations and government entities as well as individuals. All libraries should be welcoming and inclusive spaces for all library users library workers and members of the community. Each library user has the the right to use the library free of discrimination and loss of individual safety library workers also have a right to a safe workplace free from bias and discrimination. Hateful conduct should never be tolerated in the library. A librarys policies on user behavior and workplace safety and conduct should address hateful conduct as a violation of those policies. Libraries should be prepared to prosecute or support prosecution of all biasmotivated criminal acts and provide aid and support to victims of such crimes and those targeted by hateful conduct. Reports of hateful speech and hate crimes in libraries is escalating in a time when reported hate crimes are at an all time high. The American Library Association s Office for Intellectual Freedom and Office for Diversity Literacy and Outreach Services have prepared a white paper Hateful Conduct in Libraries Supporting Library Workers and Patrons to provide additional guidance for librarians struggling with issues of hate and intolerance. In responding to hate speech and hateful conduct public libraries should be aware that they operate under the First and Fourteenth Amendments and the associated court opinions governing access to the library as a designated public forum. There is an established body of case law holding that public libraries are a type of public forum and that every person using a public library has a First Amendment right to access use and take advantage of all the services the public library has to offer without regard to the persons background identity or economic status or their beliefs opinions or views. This is consistent with ALAs support for intellectual freedom as expressed in ALAs Library Bill of Rights which states that a person s right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin age background or views. Thus under law public libraries cannot discriminate against a library user or deny the user access to library resources and services based upon their views or beliefs. This principle applies to the provision of access to books media programming and the internet as well as publicly available meeting room space. Knowing that the presence and activities of some groups in public libraries while constitutionally protected can cause fear and discomfort in some library users and staff there are some strategies public libraries can employ to embrace their role as welcoming inclusive and responsible spaces that go beyond the adoption and enforcement of user behavior policies. One strategy is to forgo the provision of public meeting room spaces for all users allowing the library to fully control the messaging that takes place in its building and spaces. A second strategy is to employ the librarys right under the First Amendment to speak in its own voice as a government agency about matters of importance. The library can exercise its prerogative to convey strong messaging that counters messages of bias hatred and discrimination. Such messaging can be proactive affirmative and ongoing as well as a reaction to an incident of hateful conduct or speech. Libraries could for example mount prominent signage throughout the library and in meeting rooms announcing its support for equality diversity and inclusion and its belief in the human dignity of all persons especially those in marginalized communities. Librarysponsored programming and services can echo this message. Both the Office for Intellectual Freedom and the Office for Diversity Literacy and Outreach Services are available to provide assistance counsel and support to libraries considering these strategies.

https://www.thefire.org/research-learn/hate-speech-legal, Contrary to a common misconception most expression one might identify as hate speech is protected by the First Amendment and cannot lawfully be censored punished or unduly burdened by the government including public colleges and universities.  The Supreme Court of the United States has repeatedly rejected government attempts to prohibit or punish hate speech. Instead the Court has come to identify within the First Amendment a broad guarantee of freedom for the thought that we hate as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes described the concept in a 1929 dissent. In a 2011 ruling Chief Justice John Roberts described our national commitment to protecting hate speech in order to preserve a robust democratic dialogue  Speech is powerful. It can stir people to action move them to tears of both joy and sorrow and as it did here inflict great pain. On the facts before us we cannot react to that pain by punishing the speaker. As a Nation we have chosen a different course to protect even hurtful speech on public issues to ensure that we do not stifle public debate. In other words the First Amendment recognizes that the government cannot regulate hate speech without inevitably silencing the dissent and dialogue that democracy requires. Instead we as citizens possess the power to most effectively answer hateful speech whether through debate protest questioning laughter silence or simply walking away.  As Justice Louis Brandeis put it the framers of the Bill of Rights believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth that without free speech and assembly discussion would be futile that with them discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine that the greatest menace to freedom is an inert people that public discussion is a political duty and that this should be a fundamental principle of the American government.  Justice Brandeis argued that our nation s founders believed that prohibiting evil counsels what today we might call hate speech would backfire They recognized the risks to which all human institutions are subject. But they knew that order cannot be secured merely through fear of punishment for its infraction that it is hazardous to discourage thought hope and imagination that fear breeds repression that repression breeds hate that hate menaces stable government that the path of safety lies in the opportunity to discuss freely supposed grievances and proposed remedies and that the fitting remedy for evil counsels is good ones. Believing in the power of reason as applied through public discussion they eschewed silence coerced by law the argument of force in its worst form. Recognizing the occasional tyrannies of governing majorities they amended the Constitution so that free speech and assembly should be guaranteed. Banning hate speech without restricting political speech is prohibitively difficult because of the target s inherent subjectivity. Each American all but certainly has a different understanding of exactly what expression should lose First Amendment protection as hate speech. One citizen s hateful screed is another s religious text one citizen s slur is another s term of endearment or as the Court put it one man s vulgarity is another s lyric.  As a result crafting a generally applicable definition of hate speech is all but impossible without silencing someone s legitimate speech.Hate speech is also a moving target making a workable definition still more elusive. Conceptions of what constitutes hate do not remain stable over time. As ideas gain or lose acceptance political movements advance or recede and social commitments strengthen or erode notions of what is unacceptably hateful change too.  Today s majority viewpoint should not be allowed to foreclose that of tomorrow. For example thirty years ago the Board of Regents of Texas A M University sought to deny recognition to a gay student organization because it believed that socalled gay activities run diabolically counter to the traditions and standards of Texas A M. At the time the Board may have voiced the majority view which found the gay students speech to be beyond the pale. Today the opposite characterization might be true.  Contrary to another common misconception however the First Amendment s protection is not absolute. The Supreme Court has identified narrow exceptions to the First Amendment including but not limited to speech that constitutes unlawful incitement true threats intimidation or discriminatory harassment. Some of these carefullydefined exceptions encompass speech that one might identify as hate speech.  So is hate speech legal? Most of the time yes with a few narrow exceptions. It is quite clear that the perceived benefits of censoring psychically harmful hate speech are far outweighed by the costs of such suppression. The plus side from the perspective of those who seek speech suppression is quite limited.  That is because the new suppression would extend to only a subset of hate speech since we already punish hate speech that causes specific tangible harms threats harassment incitement and hate crimes.  Of that newly suppressible subset psychically harmful hate speech we would only punish yet another subset consisting of the most blatant expression. In contrast even advocates of restricting psychically harmful hate speech acknowledge that free speech principles would nonetheless protect more subtle expressions of racism sexism and other bias.  Yet it is likely that these more subtle expressions may well be the most damaging precisely because they cannot as easily be dismissed as biased. On the cost side permitting the government to punish psychically harmful hate speech would undermine equality and exert an incalculable chilling effect on any speech that challenges the prevailing orthodoxy in any community. There is no general 1st Amendment exception allowing the government to punish hate speech that denigrates people based on their identity. Things we call hate speech might occasionally fall into an existing 1st Amendment exception a racist speech might seek to incite imminent violence against a group or might be reasonably interpreted as an immediate threat to do harm. But hate speech like other ugly types of speech we despise is broadly protected.  The big problem for proponents of hatespeech laws and codes is that they can never explain where to draw a stable and consistent line between hate speech and vigorous criticism or who exactly can be trusted to draw it. The reason is that there is no such line.   The proposed remedies for hate speech tend to be administrative. So in practical terms if you demand the policing of speech what you want is to beef up the university administration. You are accelerating a process already under way toward bloating up the administrative apparatus in an increasingly corporatised university. It can t be a good thing to turn the development of a culture of coexistence and decency which is what you were rightly proposing to turn it into a police matter. I think that is misguided however motivated.   Defining hate speech is not just difficult it s impossible as evident from the vastly different definitions surveyed by Sellars. This inability to agree on even a basic framework underscores the futility of creating a definition narrow enough to protect free speech yet broad enough to cover any discernible category of expression. Sellars research encompassing hundreds of irreconcilable definitions has yielded no happy medium only the realization that the United States already strikes this balance through the narrow categories of speech unprotected by the First Amendment.   2024 Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression510 Walnut St. Suite 900Philadelphia PA 19106
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2019/10/29/why-america-needs-hate-speech-law/, When I was a journalist I loved Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. s assertion that the Constitution and the First Amendment are not just about protecting free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.  But as a government official traveling around the world championing the virtues of free speech I came to see how our First Amendment standard is an outlier. Even the most sophisticated Arab diplomats that I dealt with did not understand why the First Amendment allows someone to burn a Koran. Why they asked me would you ever want to protect that? Charles Lane Keep government hands off free speech It s a fair question. Yes the First Amendment protects the thought that we hate but it should not protect hateful speech that can cause violence by one group against another. In an age when everyone has a megaphone that seems like a design flaw. It is important to remember that our First Amendment doesn t just protect the good guys our foremost liberty also protects any bad actors who hide behind it to weaken our society. In the weeks leading up to the 2016 election Russia s Internet Research Agency planted false stories hoping they would go viral. They did. Russian agents assumed fake identities promulgated false narratives and spread lies on Twitter and Facebook all protected by the First Amendment. The Russians understood that our free press and its reflex toward balance and fairness would enable Moscow to slip its destructive ideas into our media ecosystem. When Putin said back in 2014 that there were no Russian troops in Crimea an outright lie he knew our media would report it and we did. That s partly because the intellectual underpinning of the First Amendment was engineered for a simpler era. The amendment rests on the notion that the truth will win out in what Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas called the marketplace of ideas. This marketplace model has a long history going back to 17thcentury English intellectual John Milton but in all that time no one ever quite explained how good ideas drive out bad ones how truth triumphs over falsehood. Milton an early opponent of censorship said truth would prevail in a free and open encounter. A century later the framers believed that this marketplace was necessary for people to make informed choices in a democracy. Somehow magically truth would emerge. The presumption has always been that the marketplace would offer a level playing field. But in the age of social media that landscape is neither level nor fair. On the Internet truth is not optimized. On the Web it s not enough to battle falsehood with truth the truth doesn t always win. In the age of social media the marketplace model doesn t work. A 2016 Stanford study showed that 82 percent of middle schoolers couldn t distinguish between an ad labeled sponsored content and an actual news story. Only a quarter of high school students could tell the difference between an actual verified news site and one from a deceptive account designed to look like a real one. Since World War II many nations have passed laws to curb the incitement of racial and religious hatred. These laws started out as protections against the kinds of antiSemitic bigotry that gave rise to the Holocaust. We call them hate speech laws but there s no agreedupon definition of what hate speech actually is. In general hate speech is speech that attacks and insults people on the basis of race religion ethnic origin and sexual orientation. Jamie Kirchick No America doesn t need a hate speech law I think it s time to consider these statutes. The modern standard of dangerous speech comes from Brandenburg v. Ohio 1969 and holds that speech that directly incites imminent lawless action or is likely to do so can be restricted. Domestic terrorists such as Dylann Roof and Omar Mateen and the El Paso shooter were consumers of hate speech. Speech doesn t pull the trigger but does anyone seriously doubt that such hateful speech creates a climate where such acts are more likely? Let the debate begin. Hate speech has a less violent but nearly as damaging impact in another way It diminishes tolerance. It enables discrimination. Isn t that by definition speech that undermines the values that the First Amendment was designed to protect fairness due process equality before the law? Why shouldn t the states experiment with their own version of hate speech statutes to penalize speech that deliberately insults people based on religion race ethnicity and sexual orientation? All speech is not equal. And where truth cannot drive out lies we must add new guardrails. I m all for protecting thought that we hate but not speech that incites hate.

https://undergradlawreview.blog.fordham.edu/first-amendment/hate-speech-its-protection-under-the-first-amendment-and-resisting-it-with-counterspeech/, The law does not look kindly upon cases in which a party attempts to legally limit hate speech. In major hate speech cases courts have tended to favor the expansion of free speech not the limitation of it. For example in the context of Skokie v. National Socialist Party 1977 the National Socalist Party of America NSPA made hateful and racist comments about Jewish people and people of color.3 At the time the village of Skokie Illinois had a population of about 5000 to 7000 Nazi concentration camp survivors.4 The Illinois Supreme Court ruled in favor of the NSPA which sought to hold a public demonstration and established that public expression of ideas may not be prohibited merely because the ideas are themselves offensive to some of their hearers. 5 To reach their decision the Illinois Supreme Court relied partially on Cohen v. California 1971 a U.S. Supreme Court the Court case that similarly dealt with freehate speech that included controversial language and symbolism. In this case Paul Cohen wore a jacket opposing the Vietnam War which read Fuck the Draft. Stop the War. 6 In Cohen the Court ruled that government restriction of speech should only occur in the most extreme cases due to the premise of individual dignity and choice upon which our political system rests. 7 Though the language and symbols that the NSPA used were extremely offensive and hateful toward marginalized and persecuted groups of people the First Amendment right to free speech triumphed in both cases. This Note addresses how the United States can eradicate hateful and offensive expression for the sake of unity without limiting the individual freedoms that the Constitution promises. In only a select few cases the Supreme Court has ruled in favor of restricting hate speech. For example in Virginia v. Black 2003 three defendants had placed burning crosses in the yards of Black families and individuals.8 They were tried and convicted on this account under a Virginia statute that prohibited cross burning.9 According to the case law the Court stated that the First Amendment affords protection to symbolic or expressive conduct as well as to actual speech. 10 In this case the protection would be surrounding the symbolism of a burning cross. However the Court also considered the group that was being targeted along with the intention behind the symbol in this case. The burning cross in Virginia was an intimidation according to Justice Sandra Day O Connor and this intimidation fell under the umbrella of a threat where a speaker directs a threat to a person or group of persons with the intent of placing the victim in fear of bodily harm or death. 11 This ruling begs the question of how to determine whether a form of speech incites fear within a person or group of people and whether that incitement constitutes a threat and is therefore no longer legally protected. In evaluating Skokie the Swastika symbol that the NSPA used is similar to the symbolism of a burning cross. Both symbols accentuate hatred and potential threats towards a marginalized group. Burning crosses as a symbol of hatred against people of color originated in 1915 after the debut of the movie The Birth of a Nation sparking the revival of the Klu Klux Klan.12 Similarly the use of the Naziappropriated Swastika represents Aryan identity and German Nationalist pride which advances the idea of those of nonAryan or German descent as inferior and racially impure leading to physical discrimination against them.13 In an appellate court review the NSPA was forbidden to fly the Swastika during their marches.14 Yet the use of discriminatory and hateful language was able to persist based on later court rulings and the organization retained permission to march against Jewish people and people of color.15 This retainment calls into question the disparate rulings. The courts failed to recognize the incitement of fear in one instance of an organization that runs on racial ethnic and religious discrimination and hate speech and yet the courts were able to recognize the incitement of fear within another group based on very similar circumstances. Limiting speech in general regardless of the personal feelings of the judges rendering the decisions is an arduous task though possible. Scholars disagree on what would eradicate it more effectively providing counterspeech to hate speech or attempting to enact laws to limit it. Jeremy Waldron a professor at New York University School of Law and Nadine Strossen former president of the American Civil Liberties Union and professor at New York Law School engaged in a public discourse about hate speech and presented differing views on how to fix the problems that hate speech breeds.16 Before presenting their arguments both agreed that a lot of hate speech does satisfy the emergency principle it constitutes a general threat or targeted harassment or hostile environment harassment or an intentional incitement of imminent violence. 17 The best way to go about eradicating it however was a topic of disagreement Strossen sides with the counterspeech method and Waldron favors a legal solution. The biggest takeaway of Strossen s point of view is the avoidance of censorship laws while still resisting hate speech to the highest extent Waldron thinks that having legislators come up with ways to legally restrict hate speech is not unattainable but reasonable. 18 While both speakers make valid points the idea of counterspeech logically speaking seems to be the most reasonable if the courts are to adhere to the text of the First Amendment. Waldron s idea would be the ideal solution but it is less attainable and has the potential of crossing some constitutional boundaries while Strossen s idea stays away from legal impropriety. The Supreme Court holds the viewpoint that freedom of speech should be completely protected unless it breaks laws already in place but it also pushes the idea that the constitutionally permissible response to speech conveying controversial disfavored views is counterspeech not censorship more speech not silence. 19 Examples of counterspeech or speech that directly shuts down discriminatorilymotivated hate speech would include instances like the dialogue and symbols of the Civil Rights Movement countless parades and marches for the LGBTQ community and more. According to the American Bar Association recently there has been remarkable and bipartisan outpouring of speech and peaceful dem onstrations that have denounced hateful ideologies while celebrating our nation s renewed commitments to equality inclusivity and intergroup harmony. 20 Though instances of counterspeech do not cater to individual hateful biases it proves that changing the rhetoric and pushing inclusivity by using the freedom of speech for good successfully reduces public forms of hate speech. For example the outpour of support for the people being discriminated against during the neoNazi incident at Charlottesville greatly outnumbered the number of white supremacists supporting the oppressive movement.21 Not only that but chief executive officers of many companies offered their own counterspeech arguments in support of marginalized people. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase stated Constructive economic and regulatory policies will not matter if we do not address the divisions in our country. 22 He offered support of both unification and of using the freedom of speech to advocate for the oppressed rather than attempting to make laws to limit speech in general. The examples of court rulings failing to suppress hate speech and the fact that social movements do more for shutting down discriminatory organizations and parties prove that counterspeech is a favorable alternative to shutting down hateful discourse. Making laws that contravene the First Amendment just to theoretically rid the United States of hate speech does not necessarily help to eradicate wrongful prejudice itself. However through counterspeech and the social movements that typically go along with it hateful discourse is reduced to an extent and provides an educational experience on putting aside bias stereotypes and prejudice against marginalized communities at the same time.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech_in_the_United_States%23Private_regulation,  Hate speech in the United States cannot be directly regulated by the government due to the fundamental right to freedom of speech protected by the Constitution. 1 While hate speech is not a legal term in the United States the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that most of what would qualify as hate speech in other western countries is legally protected speech under the First Amendment. In a Supreme Court case on the issue Matal v. Tam 2017 the justices unanimously reaffirmed that there is effectively no hate speech exception to the free speech rights protected by the First Amendment and that the U.S. government may not discriminate against speech on the basis of the speakers viewpoint. 2  In academic circles there has been debate over freedom of speech hate speech and hate speech legislation. 3 Other forms of speech have lesser protection under court interpretations of the First Amendment including commercial speech fighting words and obscenity. The protection of civil liberties including freedom of speech was not written into the original 1788 Constitution of the United States but was added two years later with the Bill of Rights implemented as several amendments to the Constitution. The First Amendment ratified December 15 1791 provides in relevant part that Congress shall make no law ... abridging the freedom of speech or of the press. The Fourteenth Amendment ratified on July 9 1868 has been interpreted by the Supreme Court as extending this prohibition to laws enacted by the states. Some limits on expression were contemplated by the framers citation needed and have been defined by the Supreme Court of the United States. In 1942 the issue of group defamation was first most explicitly brought up in Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire which surrounded the issue of a Jehovahs Witness Walter Chaplinsky who verbally attacked a town marshal for restricting his use of a public sidewalk to protest organized religion by calling him a damned fascist and racketeer. 4 Later when the court heard Beauharnais v. Illinois 5 establishing the narrow traditional exception to the First Amendment covering those words which by their very utterances tend to inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. 6  About a decade later in 1952 in Beauharnais v. Illinois the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the state of Illinoiss group libel law which punished expression attacking the reputation of racial ethnic and religious groups. 7 The defendant was charged for distributing a leaflet that rallied white people in Chicago to halt the further encroachment harassment and invasion of white people their property neighborhoods and persons by the Negro. 8 Going off Chaplinsky the court ruled that since libelous utterances are not within the area of constitutionally protected speech it did not matter that the speech did not incite any direct harm. 4 After the Beauharnais case the Supreme Court developed a free speech jurisprudence that loosened most aspects of the free speech doctrine. 8 Traditionally however if the speech did not fall within one of the categorical exceptions it was protected speech.  In 1969 the Supreme Court protected a Ku Klux Klan members speech and created the imminent danger test to determine on what grounds speech can be limited. The court ruled in Brandenburg v. Ohio that The constitutional guarantees of free speech and free press do not permit a state to forbid or proscribe advocacy of the use of force or of law violation except where such advocacy is directed to inciting imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action. 9  This test has been modified very little from its inception in 1969 though it was itself a modification from the earlier clear and present danger standard. Speech promoting violation of the law may still only be restricted when it poses an imminent danger of unlawful action where the speaker has the intention to incite such action and there is the likelihood that this will be the consequence of that speech. In 1992 in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul the issue of targeting hate speech arose again when a group of white teenagers burned a cross in the front yard of an AfricanAmerican family. The local ordinance in St. Paul Minnesota criminalized symbolic expressions tantamount to fighting words arousing anger on the basis of race among other protected classes. Associate Justice Antonin Scalia writing for the Supreme Court held that the ordinance was unconstitutional as it contravened the First Amendment by focusing on particular groups about whom speech was restricted. Scalia explained that The reason why fighting words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First Amendment is not that their content communicates any particular idea but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable and socially unnecessary mode of expressing whatever idea the speaker wishes to convey. 10 Because the hate speech ordinance was not concerned with the mode of expression but with the content of expression it was a violation of the freedom of speech. Thus the Supreme Court embraced the idea that speech in general is permissible unless it will lead to imminent violence. a citation needed The opinion noted This conduct if proved might well have violated various Minnesota laws against arson criminal damage to property among a number of others none of which was charged including threats to any person not to only protected classes. In 2003 the Supreme Court decided Virginia v. Black. 11 In a 72 majority opinion written by Justice Sandra Day OConnor the court decided that a law which criminalized public crossburning was unconstitutional. 12 The court noted that the law would be constitutional if the law included an element of specific intent to inspire fear of bodily harm instead of concluding that crossburning is prima facie evidence of intent to intimidate. The courts analysis was based upon the First Amendments free speech clause. 6  In 2011 the Supreme Court issued their ruling on Snyder v. Phelps which concerned the right of the Westboro Baptist Church to protest with signs found offensive by many Americans. Snyder the father of a soldier whose funeral was protested by Phelps church sued Phelps for intentional infliction of emotional distress. The issue presented was whether the First Amendment protected the expressions written on the signs from being the basis for civil liability. In an 8 1 decision the court sided with Fred Phelps the head of Westboro Baptist Church thereby confirming their historically strong protection of freedom of speech. The Court explained speech deals with matters of public concern when it can be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political social or other concern to the community or when it is a subject of general interest and of value and concern to the public. 13  In June 2017 the Supreme Court affirmed in a unanimous decision on Matal v. Tam that the disparagement clause of the Lanham Act violates the First Amendments free speech clause. The issue was about government prohibiting the registration of trademarks that are racially disparaging. Justice Samuel Alito wrote Speech that demeans on the basis of race ethnicity gender religion age disability or any other similar ground is hateful but the proudest boast of our free speech jurisprudence is that we protect the freedom to express the thought that we hate. United States v. Schwimmer 279 U. S. 644 655 1929 Holmes J. dissenting. 14  Justice Anthony Kennedy also wrote A law that can be directed against speech found offensive to some portion of the public can be turned against minority and dissenting views to the detriment of all. The First Amendment does not entrust that power to the governments benevolence. Instead our reliance must be on the substantial safeguards of free and open discussion in a democratic society. 14  Effectively the Supreme Court unanimously reaffirmed that there is no hate speech exception to the First Amendment. 14  In the 1980s and 1990s more than 350 public universities adopted speech codes regulating discriminatory speech by faculty and students. 15 These codes have not fared well in the courts where they are frequently overturned as violations of the First Amendment. 16 Debate over restriction of hate speech in public universities has resurfaced with the adoption of antiharassment codes covering discriminatory speech. 17  The speech that hostile work environment harassment law can prohibit varies case by case and is continually under scrutiny by the courts. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC states that Harassment is a form of employment discrimination that violates Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 ADEA and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 ADA. Harassment is unwelcome conduct that is based on race color religion sex including pregnancy national origin age 40 or older disability or genetic information. 18 For example in Brown Transport Corp. v. Commonwealth the state of Pennsylvania stated that it was religious harassment to put religious pieces in their employee newsletter and Christianthemed verses on their paychecks. 19 In Olivant v. Department of Environmental Protection the New Jersey Office of Administrative Law found jokes emailed to a workplace department and the judge ruled the jokes to defame and dishonor men and women based upon their gender sexual preference religion skin pigmentation and national and ethnic origin thereby making them illegal. 19  AT T aimed to regulate hate speech starting in the 1960s when various people and groups would connect tape recorders to a phone line and when anyone would call that line the recording would play. 20 These types of phone lines were nicknamed dialahate. 20 This technique was used by extremists groups like the Connecticut branch of the National Socialist White Peoples Party and the Ku Klux Klan. 20 These phone lines proved to be popular as a NeoNazi group in Philadelphia said they received 3800 calls per week in 1973 and a Texas branch of the Ku Klux Klan used this method all the way into 1977. 20 Some phone lines like Let Freedom Ring became popular shows that people would call in to hear a new recording every week much like an early form of a podcast. 20  AT T tried several times to end the dialahate lines but phone companies and regulators said nothing could be done to shut down the recordings and courts protected them under the First Amendment. Eventually AT T required that the operators of the line identify themselves. 20 Between this new AT T policy and the growing expense of having a phone line the dialahate lines came to an end. Many of the groups found new and less expensive ways of promoting their agenda like sending messages through fax machines and digital bulletin boards. Eventually the extremist group would spread their messages through the internet and social media.  In 1992 Congress directed the National Telecommunications and Information Administration NTIA to examine the role of telecommunications including broadcast radio and television cable television public access television and computer bulletin boards in advocating or encouraging violent acts and the commission of hate crimes against designated persons and groups. The NTIA study investigated speech that fostered a climate of hatred and prejudice in which hate crimes may occur. 21 The study failed to link telecommunication to hate crimes but did find that individuals have used telecommunications to disseminate messages of hate and bigotry to a wide audience. Its recommendation was that the best way to fight hate speech was through additional speech promoting tolerance as opposed to government regulation. 22 23 page needed
