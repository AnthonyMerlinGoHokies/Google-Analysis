https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/28/black-and-white-americans-are-far-apart-in-their-views-of-reparations-for-slavery/, Americans view the prospect of reparations mostly negatively a 2021 Pew Research Center survey found. Threeinten U.S. adults say descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should be repaid in some way such as given land or money. About seveninten 68 say these descendants should not be repaid. This analysis examines differences in Americans views about reparations for slavery in the country. It is part of a larger project that aims to understand Americans views of racial inequity and social change in the United States. For this analysis we surveyed 3912 Black U.S. adults from Oct. 417 2021. Black U.S. adults include those who are singlerace nonHispanic Black Americans multiracial nonHispanic Black Americans and adults who indicate they are Black and Hispanic. The survey includes 1025 Black adults on Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel ATP and 2887 Black adults on Ipsos KnowledgePanel. Respondents on both panels are recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. We surveyed 6513 U.S. adults on the ATP for the general population portion of the survey. White and Asian respondents include those who report being only one race and are not Hispanic. Hispanics are of any race. Recruiting panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. This gives us confidence that any sample can represent the whole population see our Methods 101 explainer on random sampling. Here are the questions used for the survey along with responses and its methodology. Views of reparations for slavery vary widely by race and ethnicity especially between Black and White Americans. Around threequarters of Black adults 77 say the descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. should be repaid in some way while 18 of White Americans say the same. There are also notable differences by partisan affiliation. Among Democrats and Democraticleaning independents views are split 48 say descendants of enslaved people should be repaid in some way while 49 say they shouldn t be repaid. By comparison only 8 of Republicans and GOP leaners say these descendants should be repaid in some way and 91 say they should not. When it comes to age younger adults are more likely than older ones to say the descendants of enslaved people should be repaid 45 of adults under 30 take this view compared with 18 of adults 65 and older. When Americans are asked about the legacy of slavery s effect on Black people today 58 of the overall public says this affects the position of Black people in American society at least a fair amount with 28 saying it affects them a great deal. Fourinten U.S. adults say the legacy of slavery has not much or not at all affected the position of Black Americans in the country today. As with views of reparations racial and ethnic differences on this question are notable. Black Americans 85 are more likely than Hispanic 64 and White 50 Americans to say the legacy of slavery affects the position of Black people in the U.S. a fair amount or a great deal. The partisan gap on this question is also wide. More than eightinten Democrats 82 say the legacy of slavery affects Black people in the U.S. a fair amount or a great deal more than 50 percentage points greater than the share of Republicans who say this 29. Black Americans are much more likely to identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party only about oneinten Black voters identify with or lean toward the Republican Party. As of 2020 White voters are slightly more evenly split but the GOP has an advantage 53 to 42. In the Center s 2021 survey the 30 of Americans who favored reparations were also asked about the institutions and individuals who bear responsibility for repayment. They were presented with four options the U.S. federal government businesses and banks that profited from slavery colleges and universities that benefited from slavery and descendants of families who engaged in the slave trade. Threequarters of reparations supporters say the federal government has all or most of the responsibility to repay descendants of enslaved people. A smaller share though still a majority say businesses and banks that profited from slavery 65 have all or most of the responsibility. Fewer say the same about colleges and universities that benefited from slavery 53 and descendants of families who engaged in the slave trade 44. Reparations supporters were also asked how helpful the following forms of repayment would be educational scholarships financial assistance for starting or improving a business financial assistance for buying or remodeling a home and cash payments. These adults are most likely to say educational scholarships would be very or extremely helpful 82 followed by financial assistance with businesses 75 financial assistance with home buying or remodeling 73 and cash payments 57.  There are some racial ethnic and partisan differences in Americans views of both the institutions that would be responsible for reparations as well as the specific forms that reparations might take. For example more than sixinten Black and Hispanic reparations supporters 63 and 69 respectively say colleges and universities that benefited from slavery bear all or most of the responsibility for repaying descendants of enslaved people. By comparison White and Asian American supporters of reparations are notably less likely to hold this view 41 and 44 respectively. Among those who support reparations Democrats are 20 points more likely than Republicans to say the federal government bears all or most of the responsibility for repayment 77 vs. 57. When it comes to various forms of repayment majorities of Black American reparations supporters say all four forms of assistance would be extremely or very helpful and those in other racial and ethnic groups largely agree. Americans in each racial and ethnic group are least likely to say cash payments would be helpful. Those who support reparations to descendants of people enslaved in the U.S. were also asked whether repayment of any type or from any source would happen in their lifetime. Most supporters of the idea say this is not likely. Overall threequarters of U.S. adults who support repayment to descendants of enslaved people say it is a little or not at all likely that this will happen in their lifetime. Only 10 say it is extremely or very likely. There are a few demographic differences among respondents on this question too. Hispanic 21 and Asian American 13 reparations supporters are more likely than their White 6 or Black 7 counterparts to say it s extremely or very likely that these descendants will be repaid in their lifetime. And supporters ages 18 to 49 12 are more likely than those 50 and older 5 to say it s extremely or very likely that these descendants will be repaid in their lifetime.

https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-we-need-reparations-for-black-americans/,  SociologistRay Andre M. Perry Andre M. Perry Senior Fellow Brookings Metro andreperryedu  Race Prosperity and Inclusion Initiative Central to the idea of the American Dream lies an assumption that we all have an equal opportunity to generate the kind of wealth that brings meaning to the words life liberty and the pursuit of happiness boldly penned in the Declaration of Independence. The American Dream portends that with hard work a person can own a home start a business and grow a nest egg for generations to draw upon. This belief however has been defied repeatedly by the United States government s own decrees that denied wealthbuilding opportunities to Black Americans. Today the average white family has roughly 10 times the amount of wealth as the average Black family. White college graduates have over seven times more wealth than Black college graduates. Making the American Dream an equitable reality demands the same U.S. government that denied wealth to Blacks restore that deferred wealth through reparations to their descendants in the form of individual cash payments in the amount that will close the Blackwhite racial wealth divide. Additionally reparations should come in the form of wealthbuilding opportunities that address racial disparities in education housing and business ownership. In 1860 over 3 billion was the value assigned to the physical bodies of enslaved Black Americans to be used as free labor and production. This was more money than was invested in factories and railroads combined. In 1861 the value placed on cotton produced by enslaved Blacks was 250 million. Slavery enriched white slave owners and their descendants and it fueled the country s economy while suppressing wealth building for the enslaved. The United States has yet to compensate descendants of enslaved Black Americans for their labor. Nor has the federal government atoned for the lost equity from antiBlack housing transportation and business policy. Slavery Jim Crow segregation antiBlack practices like redlining and other discriminatory public policies in criminal justice and education have robbed Black Americans of the opportunities to build wealth defined as assets minus debt afforded to their white peers. Bootstrapping isn t going to erase racial wealth divides. As economists William Sandy Darity and Darrick Hamilton point out in their 2018 report What We Get Wrong About Closing the Wealth Gap Blacks cannot close the racial wealth gap by changing their individual behavior i.e. by assuming more personal responsibility or acquiring the portfolio management insights associated with financial literacy. In fact white high school dropouts have more wealth than Black college graduates. Moreover the racial wealth gap did not result from a lack of labor. Rather it came from a lack of financial capital. Not only do racial wealth disparities reveal fallacies in the American Dream the financial and social consequences are significant and wideranging. Wealth is positively correlated with better health educational and economic outcomes. Furthermore assets from homes stocks bonds and retirement savings provide a financial safety net for the inevitable shocks to the economy and personal finances that happen throughout a person s lifespan. Recessions impact everyone but wealth is distributed quite unevenly in the U.S. The woeful inadequacy of a governmentsponsored safety net was made apparent in the wake of economic disasters like the 2008 housing crisis and natural ones like Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Those who can draw upon the equity in a home savings and securities are able to recover faster after economic downturns than those without wealth. The lack of a social safety net and the racial wealth divide are currently on display amid the COVID19 crisis. Disparities in access to health care along with inequities in economic policies combine to make Black people more vulnerable to negative consequences than white individuals. Below we provide a history of reparations in the United States missed opportunities to redress the racial wealth gap and specific details of a viable reparations package for Black Americans. Reparations a system of redress for egregious injustices are not foreign to the United States. Native Americans have received land and billions of dollars for various benefits and programs for being forcibly exiled from their native lands. For Japanese Americans 1.5 billion was paid to those who were interned during World War II. Additionally the United States via the Marshall Plan helped to ensure that Jews received reparations for the Holocaust including making various investments over time. In 1952 West Germany agreed to pay 3.45 billion Deutsche Marks to Holocaust survivors. Black Americans are the only group that has not received reparations for statesanctioned racial discrimination while slavery afforded some white families the ability to accrue tremendous wealth. And we must note that American slavery was particularly brutal. About 15 percent of the enslaved shipped from Western Africa died during transport. The enslaved were regularly beaten and lynched for frivolous infractions. Slavery also disrupted families as one in three marriages were split up and one in five children were separated from their parents. The case for reparations can be made on economic social and moral grounds. The United States had multiple opportunities to atone for slavery each a missed chance to make the American Dream a reality but has yet to undertake significant action. The first major opportunity that the United States had and where it should have atoned for slavery was right after the Civil War. Union leaders including General William Sherman concluded that each Black family should receive 40 acres. Sherman signed Field Order 15 and allocated 400000 acres of confiscated Confederate land to Black families. Additionally some families were to receive mules left over from the war hence 40 acres and a mule. Yet after President Abraham Lincoln s assassination President Andrew Johnson reversed Field Order 15 and returned land back to former slave owners. Instead of giving Blacks the means to support themselves the federal government empowered former enslavers. For example in Washington D.C. slave owners were actually paid reparations for lost property the formally enslaved. This practice was also common in nearby states. Many Black Americans with limited work options returned as sharecroppers to till the same land for the very slave owners to whom they were once enslaved. Slave owners not only made money off the chattel enslavement of Black Americans but they then made money multiple times over off the land that the formerly enslaved had no choice but to work. There s never a bad time to do what s morally right but the United States has had prime opportunities to atone for slavery. In the 1930s the United States was reeling from the 1929 stock market crash and was firmly engulfed in the Great Depression. The Franklin Roosevelt administration implemented a series of policies as part of his New Deal legislation estimated to cost roughly 50 billion then to catapult the country out of depression. Current estimates price the New Deal at about 50 trillion. Two particular policies of the New Deal fell short in redressing American s racial wrongs the G.I. Bill and Social Security. Though white and Black Americans fought in WWII Black veterans could not redeem their postwar benefits like their white peers. While the G.I. Bill was mandated federally it was implemented locally. The presence of racial housing covenants and redlining among local municipalities prohibited Blacks from utilizing federal benefits. White soldiers were afforded the opportunity to build wealth by sending themselves and their children to college and by obtaining housing and small business grants. Regarding Social Security two key professions that would have improved equity in America were excluded from the legislation domestic and farm workers. These omissions effectively excluded 60 percent of Blacks across the U.S. and 75 percent in southern states who worked in these occupations. Roosevelt bargained these exclusionary provisions in the legislation on the backs of Black veterans and workers in order to propel mostly white America out of the Great Depression. There are other policies and practices that contributed to racial wealth gap. Governmentsanctioned discrimination related to the 1862 Homestead Act redlining restrictive covenants and convict leasing blocked Blacks from the ability to gain wealth at similar rates as whites. Separate from slavery damages should be awarded to Black people who were harmed by these policies and practices. We know the monetary value that was placed on enslaved Blacks and the productivity of their labor as well as the amount of the racial wealth gap. We ve seen other groups receive restitutions while the federal government pulled back reparations for Black Americans. Accordingly if we want to close the racial wealth gap and live up to our moral creed to protect life liberty and the pursuit of happiness a federal reparations package for Black Americans is in order. This package should include individual and collective public benefits that simultaneously builds wealth and eliminates debt among Black citizens. We assert that it should be similar to the Harriet Tubman Community Investment Act which was recently heard before the Maryland General Assembly where Ray testified on its behalf. The Harriet Tubman Community Investment Act aims to atone for slavery and its legacy by addressing education homeownership and business ownership barriers. Individual payments for descendants of enslaved Black Americans The U.S. government owes lost wages as well as damages to the people it helped enslave. In addition to the lost wages the accumulative amount of restitution for individuals should eliminate the racial wealth gap that currently exists. According to the Federal Reserve s most recent numbers in 2016 based on the Survey of Consumer Finances white families had the highest median family wealth at 171000 compared to Black and Hispanic families which had 17600 and 20700 respectively. College tuition to 4year or 2year colleges and universities for descendants of enslaved Black Americans People should be able to use the tuition remission to obtain a bachelor s degree or an associate svocational or technical degree. Tuition should be available for public or private universities. Considering the racial gap in the ability to obtain degrees at private schools this part of the package will further help to reduce racial disparities by affording more social network access and opportunity structures. Student loan forgiveness for descendants of enslaved Black Americans Student loan debt continues to be a significant barrier to wealth creation for Black college graduates. Among 2555 year olds about 40 percent of Blacks compared to 30 percent of whites have student loan debt. Blacks also have nearly 45000 of student loan debt compared to about 30000 for whites. Recent research finds that Blacks are more likely to be allocated unsubsidized loans. Furthermore graduates of Historically Black Colleges and Universities compared to Predominately White Institutions are more likely to receive subprime loans with higher interest rates. Universities including Georgetown and Princeton Theological Seminary which is the secondoldest seminary in the country are aiming to atone for the fact that the sale of slaves helped to fortify their university endowments and establish them as elite institutions of higher education on a global scale. Descendants of the slaves sold by Georgetown and Princeton Theological Seminary are now entitled to full rights and benefits bestowed by those universities to obtain degrees across the higher education pipeline. The Virginia state legislature voted for some of its state universities to atone for slavery with reparations. Other universities along with state legislatures and the federal government should follow suit.  Down payment grants and housing revitalization grants for descendants of enslaved Black Americans Down payment grants will provide Black Americans with some initial equity in their homes relative to mortgage insurance loans. Housing revitalization grants will help Black Americans to refurbish existing homes in neighborhoods that have been neglected due to a lack of government and corporate investments in predominately Black communities. Given recent settlements for predatory lending low and fixed interest rates as well as property tax caps in areas in which housing prices are significantly devalued should be part of the package. After accounting for factors such as housing quality neighborhood quality education and crime owneroccupied homes in Black neighborhoods are undervalued by 48000 per home on average amounting to a whopping 156 billion that homeowners would have received if their homes were priced at market rates according to Brookings research. As gentrification occurs Blacks are typically priced out of neighborhoods they helped to maintain while the historical and current remnants of redlining and restrictive covenants inhibited investments. Some Black Americans are being forced from their family home of decades because of tax increases as neighborhoods are gentrified. This is an important point because some 2020 Democratic presidential candidates aimed to redress the racial wealth gap by focusing on historically redlined districts. Perry s research shows that these policies fall short of capturing a large segment of Black Americans. Business grants for business starting up business expansion to hire more employees or purchasing property for descendants of enslaved Black Americans Blackowned businesses are more likely to be located in predominately Black neighborhoods that need the infrastructure and businesses. However Black business owners are still less likely to obtain capital from banks to make their businesses successful. This reparations package for Black Americans is about restoring the wealth that has been extracted from Black people and communities. Still reparations are all for naught without enforcement of antidiscrimination policies that remove barriers to economic mobility and wealth building. The architecture of the economy must change in order to create an equitable society. The racial wealth gap was created by racist policies. Federal intervention is needed to remove the racism that undergirds those polices. In some respects the question of who should receive reparations is more controversial than what or how much people should be awarded. One key question after deciding what a reparations package should include is who should qualify. In short a Black person who can trace their heritage to people enslaved in U.S. states and territories should be eligible for financial compensation for slavery. Meanwhile Black people who can show how they were excluded from various policies after emancipation should seek separate damages. For instance a person like Senator Cory Booker whose parents are descendants of slaves would qualify for slavery reparations whereas Senator Kamala Harris Jamaican immigrant father and Indian immigrant mother and President Barack Obama Kenyan immigrant father and white mother may seek redress for housing andor education segregation. Sasha and Malia Obama whose mother is Michelle Robinson Obama a descendant of enslaved Africans would qualify. To determine qualification birth records can initially be used to determine if a person was classified as Black American. Economist Sandy Darity asserts that people should show a consistent pattern of identification. Census records can then be used to determine if a person has consistently identified as Black American. Finally DNA testing can be used as a supplement to determine lineage. This is how Senator Booker who first introduced a reparations bill in the Senate learned that his lineage stemmed from Sierra Leone. For the descendants of the 12.5 million Blacks who were shipped in chains from Western Africa America has a genetic birth defect when it comes to the question of race as stated recently by U.S. Representative Hakeem Jeffries. If America is to atone for this defect reparations for Black Americans is part of the healing and reconciliation process. With April 4 marking the fiftysecond year since Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis we think it is appropriate to end with an oftforgotten quote from Dr. King s I Have a Dream Speech that he gave in 1963 in Washington D.C. This statement is still one of the unfulfilled aspects of this policyrelated speech We have come to our nation s capital to cash a check. When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir. It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation America has given the Negro people a bad check a check which has come back marked insufficient funds. But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt. Given the lingering legacy of slavery on the racial wealth gap the monetary value we know that was placed on enslaved Blacks the fact that other groups have received reparations and the fact that Blacks were originally awarded reparations only to have them rescinded provide overwhelming evidence that it is time to pay reparations to the descendants of enslaved Blacks.

https://www.investopedia.com/should-america-pay-slavery-reparations-5080415,  Slavery reparations are restitution payments for slavery remitted to the descendants of enslaved people. In theory American slavery reparations would be paid by entities that participated in slavery such as the federal government local governments corporations and universities.  The history is complicated but the overall principle is simple Slavery helped the United States become a formidable economic power. It had the opposite effect on enslaved people and their descendants stripping them of wages property civil rights and freedom. Since the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was passed and ratified in 1865 ending legal slavery in the U.S. no sustained attempt has been made to right this disparity lending additional weight to the strong case that reparations would still be beneficial today.  On Jan. 16 1865 from a mansion in Savannah Ga. Union General William Tecumseh Sherman issued Field Order No. 15 announcing the award of large tracts of confiscated land to newly freed Black populations. The roughly 400000 acres to be awarded The islands from Charleston south the abandoned rice fields along the rivers for thirty miles back from the sea and the country bordering the St. Johns River Florida.   The land which included Georgia s Sea Islands was to be given out in parcels of not more than 40 acres of tillable ground. The new owners rights were to be protected by the military authorities until they could protect themselves or Congress could regulate their title. And they were to govern those lands themselves ...sole and exclusive management of affairs will be left to the freed people themselves subject only to the United States military authority and the acts of Congress the order declared.  This idea did not just happen. Four days before as historian Henry Louis Gates Jr. explains Sherman and Lincoln s Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton met with an invited group of 20 leaders of the Black community of Savannah many of them Baptist and Methodist ministers. These leaders explained that what the newly freed people wanted was to have their own land and to live in communities on it managing their own affairs.  The land grant program became colloquially known as 40 acres and a mule the mule part coming later when as Gates explains Sherman subsequently ordered that the Army could lend mules to the settlers. Word of Sherman s order spread quickly and the islands seemed to transform into Black autonomous farming communities overnight. The inhabitants of the islands renamed them Sherman Land in gratitude.  The federal reparations experiment was shortlived however. After Abraham Lincoln was assassinated in April 1865 his successor Andrew Johnson canceled the program and returned the land to the planters who had originally owned it. Since then for more than 150 years groups have been advocating for reparations.  The effect of generations of enslavement on the wealth and economic standing of Black Americans and the structural racism following emancipation has never been fully mitigated and exists to this day. With the increased attention on race relations and equality brought on by the Black Lives Matter protests the issue of reparations has come back into focus.  On the other hand the United States government has not attempted reparations since the Lincoln administration. A bill to study reparations called H.R. 40 was introduced in 1989 but the U.S. House of Representatives has never voted on it. In the 2022 U.S. midterm elections voters in four states Alabama Oregon Tennessee and Vermont approved amendments to their state constitutions to officially outlaw slavery and involuntary servitude as punishments for crimes. Louisiana voters however rejected a similar proposal.  Examining the role of slavery in building the economic predominance of the United States north and south the role of the federal government in establishing the laws that allowed it and other large institutions to profit from the labor of enslaved people and the lingering effects of both slavery and postslavery structural racism on the descendants of enslaved people establish a strong argument for reparations.  The federal government and other large domestic institutions were participants and stakeholders in the practice of enslavement. The savings produced by using enslaved workers spurred economic growth for the country as a whole and slave owners particularly while impoverishing generations of Blacks by depriving them of fundamental rights freedom and compensation.  It was near the turn of the century in 1793 when Massachusettsborn Eli Whitney invented the cotton engine the machine that automated the painstaking task of removing the seeds from raw cotton by hand. Nicknamed the cotton gin the invention revolutionized American cotton production. In short order the U.S. became the leading cotton producer in the world.  The cotton boom created a demand for labor to work on cotton farms which cotton growers met by purchasing slaves. According to census records the number of slaves in America went from 894452 in 1800 to 3953587 in 1860. During that same period the per capita gross domestic product GDP of the United States more than doubled going from 58 1540 in 2019 dollars in 1800 to 125 3243 in 1860.  During the slavery era in the United States enslaved Black workers made up nearly half the workforce in the Southern states. Unlike the white labor pool these workers received no wages or profitsharing and lived and worked in bondage. The U.S. cotton industry which depended on enslaved plantation labor in the Deep South accounted for at least 5 of the U.S. GDP. All slaverelated productivity accounted for as much as 50 of the GDP according to author and historian E.E. Baptist.  Enslaved people worked in many different jobs ranging from manual labor to highly skilled trades. The most common jobs for enslaved people were as farmhands or domestic workers. Enslaved Black people also worked bluecollar jobs like construction and coal mining. There were also thousands who worked in skilled trades such as cooking carpentry shipbuilding blacksmithing and masonry.  Slavery was a wealth transfer from enslaved Black laborers to America s antebellum ownership and managerial class. For example Natchez Miss. the cottongrowing capital of the 19th century had more millionaires than any other city in the world. Today Natchez s Black population who are mostly descended from its enslaved workers still disproportionately live in poverty.  Enslaved Black laborers also built much of the infrastructure of the United States including much of New York City the White House and the Capitol. They also quarried the sandstone used to build the Smithsonian.  These unpaid wages erased the labor costs of businesses that used slave labor and increased their profit margins. Abraham Lincoln opposed slavery in part because he believed it was wage theft.   The government played a direct role in maintaining slavery and also reaped immediate benefits from it. Under the Fugitive Slave Acts of 1793 and 1850 U.S. Marshals were mandated to recover slaves who escaped and return them to enslavement.   When the U.S. Constitution was signed into law in 1787 it included language that permitted the government to collect taxes on people trafficked to America via the transatlantic slave trade permitting a tax of not exceeding ten dollars for each person on importation of such persons in Article I Section 9. From 1798 to 1802 and 1813 to 1816 the United States Treasury collected taxes on slaves as one of its chief sources of revenue along with taxes on land and houses. Many slave states collected as much as 2 of the valuation of each enslaved person per year as a tax.  History has understated how much the United States government used slavery to generate revenue during the antebellum period. As a starting point for reparations it seems logical to believe that the revenue generated from taxes on enslaved people could be returned to their descendants.   A number of multinational corporations owned enslaved people in their early history. In addition to JPMorgan Chase the companies that became Bank of America Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. Aetna Inc. New York Life Insurance Company and Lloyds Banking Group participated in slavery. Cotton commodities and plantation shares and bonds sometimes underwritten with deeds to enslaved people were traded on the New York Stock Exchange in the antebellum era.  Some of America s oldest colleges and universities including Harvard Yale Brown the University of Virginia Columbia and Princeton were built by enslaved workers and partially funded by the slave trade.  As noted above Georgetown University recently began offering scholarships to the descendants of people it enslaved and the University of Virginia is building a memorial to the enslaved people who lived and worked on its campus. Other institutions have yet to try to make amends for their role in slavery.  Despite their two centuries of contributions hundreds of thousands of African Americans were left destitute after they were emancipated. After 1865 many free Black people faced starvation and homelessness and were forced to go back to work as sharecroppers on plantations for subsistence wages.  The gap in wealth between the free White population and the newly emancipated Black population became generational through laws that mandated segregation disenfranchisement and economic oppression for the next 100 years. This crystalized a stubborn racial wealth gap that still exists today.  Instead of attempting to close the gap between the Black population and the White population created by enslavement racist laws began to go into effect almost immediately after slavery ended to limit Black people s access to benefits such as education and trades. This effort culminated in 1892 with the Supreme Court case Plessy vs. Ferguson which legalized segregation establishing the notorious doctrine of separate but equal.   For the next 70 years Black Americans would be denied access to jobs schools and labor unions. When President Roosevelt passed the New Deal programs in the 1930s the original legislation excluded domestic workers and farmworkers occupations that employed roughly 65 of African American workers. The GI Bill signed in 1944 also was structured in a way that shut out many Black veterans. The Federal Housing Administration a government agency created to promote homeownership often refused to underwrite mortgages for Black homebuyers. This practice is known as redlining.   Even after the Civil Rights Act became law in 1964 attempts to disadvantage the Black population continued. In 1971 President Nixon launched the war on drugs which began an era of mass incarceration that disproportionately jailed Black individuals. In a 1994 interview reported in 2016 Nixon s domestic policy chief John Ehrlichman stated the program was designed to criminalize Black people.  In concert more than 100 years of discriminatory policies after emancipation worked effectively to prevent Black Americans from fully closing the racial income and wealth gap that originated with slavery. The numbers say it all When slavery ended in 1863 Black people owned roughly one half of 1 of the nation s wealth. Today that ownership is still less than 2.  Percentage of U.S. population that is Black or African American alone according to the U.S. Census.  Slavery reparations are often proposed as a cash payout to the descendants of enslaved people. A few universities and corporations that owned enslaved people have begun giving scholarships to the descendants of the people they enslaved. Other than cash payments to Black Americans proposals have included an extensive federal government economic development program that benefits Black communities. And some proponents have called for a reparation program of payments to Black Americans directly from white Americans but these proposals are outliers.  The exact dollar amount of slavery reparations would need to be calculated as part of a government study on reparations by a federal commission such as the one proposed by the reparations bill H.R. 40. Estimated costs for the program fall somewhere around 16 trillion the entire currentday book value of the four generations of slaves who lived in the United States from after the country s independence in 1776 until the Emancipation Proclamation in 1865. Another way of determining the amount would be to determine the amount in lost wages which would yield a similar figure.  A reparations program for Black Americans would not be unprecedented the United States has paid reparations in other instances.  In addition to the U.S. the state of Florida paid restitution to those who survived the Rosewood massacre of 1923 in which white mobs burned the Black community of Rosewood and murdered at least six people. It took until 1994 for a law to be passed approving these payments which gave the nine survivors 150000 each and provided 500000 to descendants in addition to establishing a scholarship fund for descendants.  How would a slavery reparations program be funded? Deficit spending is the most feasible approach. The taxes needed to support such an expensive program would be onerous. And there is precedent for it In 1833 the United Kingdom passed the Slavery Abolition Act across much of the British Empire. It paid to liberate its enslaved population by compensating slave owners to the tune of 20 million through deficit spending 2.4 billion3.11 billion today.  To put the cost of slavery reparations in context The program would be less pricey than the proposed outlays for proposals for Medicare for All at 20.5 trillion and the Green New Deal at an estimated 5090 trillion.  H.R. 40 a bill proposing a federal commission to examine slavery reparations previously garnered the endorsement of President Joe Biden and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Initially the bill had 157 cosponsors and held the support of 114 all Democrats. The bill which has been under consideration for over three decades without leaving committee made progress on April 19 2021 when it was moved forward by the Judiciary Committee with a 2517 vote. However the bill is stalled in Congress due to a lack of legislative action.  In 2023 Senator Cory Booker introduced S.40 the Commission to Study and Develop Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act which would establish a commission to explore reparations for descendants of slavery. This bill is a Senate companion to H.R. 40 focusing on the impact of slavery and ongoing discrimination with an aim to propose reparations. It emphasizes the need to address the historical oppression of African Americans and proposes a comprehensive study to assess and repair the impacts of slavery in the U.S.  The high cost isn t the only obstacle to slavery reparations. Low support for slavery reparations among white Americans and questions about logistics are also obstacles to moving forward.  While awareness of racial disparities in the U.S. is increasing opinions on reparations remain divided. A 2020 Reuters poll revealed that only 10 of white respondents support paying reparations.  In contrast a significant majority of Black Americans 85 recognize the ongoing impact of slavery s legacy on their community s status with 77 endorsing some form of reparations for descendants of enslaved people in the U.S. Party affiliations also influence views on this issue with 90 of Republicans opposing reparations while 64 of Democrats support the idea.  Some Americans have expressed opposition to paying out reparations because the people who were enslaved are dead. These beliefs ignore the debilitating effect of more than two centuries of enslavement on Black Americans. They also do not weigh the fact that instead of making efforts to remedy the damage caused by slavery the government moved to make those injuries permanent by creating a racial caste system through legal segregation and discrimination.  Attitudes about slavery reparations also vary by age. The 2016 Exclusive Point TakenMarist poll conducted in conjunction with the PBS debate series Point Taken showed that 80 of Americans over age 69 opposed reparations while a narrow majority of millennials 51 either supported the idea 40 or were unsure 11.  Another obstacle would be establishing eligibility. Though it could be laborintensive to determine which Americans are the descendants of enslaved people it is possible. A majority of Black Americans fall into this category. The remaining Black Americans are the descendants of immigrants mostly from Africa and the Caribbean and could be determined as such via immigration and vital records.  Though many Americans continue to view reparations as unnecessary attitudes are shifting as a greater focus is put on a legacy of slavery and racial discrimination in America. Institutions coming clean about how they owned enslaved people or otherwise profited from the trade of enslaved labor is bringing into ever greater focus the unacknowledged role that enslaved people played in building the United States.  The political landscape for reparations legislation particularly H.R. 40 has evolved recently. While the bill previously had 157 cosponsors it now has 114 reflecting a shift in congressional support. With the Republican majority in the House and Mike Johnson R replacing Nancy Pelosi as speaker the bill s progress faces new challenges. Additionally despite the Democratic majority in the Senate passing the bill remains challenging due to the need for 60 votes to overcome a filibuster.  Former President Donald Trump said in June 2020 I don t see reparations happening. However he later released the Platinum Plan for Black Americans which mirrored some of the language from entertainer Ice Cube s reparations plan A Contract with Black America. Though scant on details Trump s plan called for up to 40 billion in funding for Blackowned federal contractors.  California has established itself as a leader in researching and addressing the issue of slavery reparations. Following two years of hearings the state s commission established by Assembly Bill 3121 has released a report with significant findings. The commission recommends reparations amounting to about 1.2 million per individual a landmark decision in the reparations movement. This statelevel initiative is distinct from any federal reparations actions and sets a precedent for similar studies and actions across the country.  Meanwhile Evanston s reparations program focusing on economic development is viewed as a model for other cities considering reparations. Reparations for slavery are proposed compensations aimed at the descendants of enslaved individuals acknowledging the unpaid labor and hardships endured by their ancestors. The idea is that entities such as the federal and local governments corporations and educational institutions which historically benefited from slavery would provide these reparations. The idea of reparations for slavery in the United States originated during the Civil War era. One example is General Sherman s Field Order No. 15 which aimed to provide land to emancipated slaves. The order ultimately redistributed 400000 acres of land to newly freed Black families in 40acre segments. However lasting reparations were not established. Recent proposals for federal reparations include direct payments to African Americans and economic development investments in Black communities. Some institutions and local governments have started their own reparations programs. For example a California task force that studied and developed reparations proposals released a comprehensive report in June 2023 and Evanston Illinois has initiated a reparations program funded by a tax on recreational marijuana.  The issue of slavery reparations in the United States centers on addressing the longstanding economic and social disparities caused by slavery and ongoing discrimination against African Americans. Recent years have seen a growing recognition of these injustices with some local governments and institutions beginning to implement reparations programs.  However the conversation around federal reparations remains complex and polarized. As public opinion and political support fluctuate with changing political landscapes the concept of reparations is increasingly viewed as a means to address longstanding injustices and their ongoing effects on African American communities.

Jeff ChiuAP hide caption   A reparations rally outside City Hall in San Francisco this month as supervisors take up a draft reparations proposal. The growing number of local actions has renewed hopes and questions about a national policy. Local reparations programs in about a dozen cities and the state of California have renewed hopes for an eventual national policy to compensate for slavery. But after decades of lobbying and three years of a national reckoning over race Americans overall remain strongly opposed to the idea. When Tatishe Nteta began polling about it several years ago he expected money would be the biggest issue. Or perhaps the workability of such a complex undertaking. It turns out those are the smallest concerns among the twothirds of Americans who say theyre against cash payments to the descendants of slaves. A plurality of Americans Nteta says dont believe the descendants of slaves deserve reparations. Nteta and also the Pew Research Center find about threequarters or more of white adults oppose reparations and so do a majority of Latinos and Asian Americans. A large majority of Black Americans support them. Theres also more support among younger people and a sharp political divide with overwhelming opposition from Republicans and conservatives. On a recent sunny day on the National Mall in Washington D.C. it was not hard to find reparations opponents willing to share their reasoning. You cant take what we know now and try to superimpose yourself onto 150 years ago says Jeff Bernauer visiting from Huntsville Alabama. He calls racism a sin and says of course slavery was wrong. But to try and make amends at this point makes no sense. The generation that would be paying for it have nothing to do with what was done in the past he says. And then youre paying people that have nothing to do with it in the past. Terry Keuhn of upstate New York agrees and does not like the idea of a targeted program that would only help some people. Were all immigrants at some point whether it was voluntary or forced she says. And nobody needs a handout anymore. Everybody you know pulls themselves up by their own bootstraps and works for a living and makes their way in this world. A majority of our sample tends to think that weve made steady progress towards greater equality in wealth between families so between black and white families he says. That is totally inconsistent with reality. Most of those he surveyed thought that today for every 100 dollars white families have Black families have about 90. In fact the racial wealth gap is exponentially larger. Given its magnitude and the recent intense focus on racial justice around the country Kraus calls this disconnect a kind of collective willful ignorance. Sure he says many people especially white may be isolated from those in different economic circumstances and so find it difficult to fathom the enormous wealth gap. But he says it doesnt take much work to understand that Black people continue to be discriminated against in the job market housing banking and other areas. Hes come to believe that some consciously or not are avoiding information they may find uncomfortable. Dorothy Brown is a convert on reparations. The Georgetown law professor dismissed the idea as impractical and unlikely until she wrote a book about how even the U.S. tax system favors white families at the expense of Black ones. She decided the countrys persistent wealth gap goes back to slavery and so the only solution is reparations. Although she thinks they should be about systemic changes and not just cash. In 2 to 3 years that wealth would wind up in white hands because our system for building wealth is not one designed for Black wealth she says. Brown is not daunted by the lack of public support. Her forthcoming book will make the case for reparations and she thinks many Americans are persuadable. Brown sees a model in U.S. reparations for Japanese Americans whod been interned during World War II. Before the activist push for them fundamentally there was a lack of knowledge about what happened says historian Alice Yang of the University of California Santa Cruz. Then in 1980 and 1981 Congress held hearings in 20 cities around the country and they included powerful testimony from people whod been incarcerated with their families as children. Those hearings had a major impact on public perception of what happened during the war how Japanese Americans were affected by it and why redress might be appropriate Yang says. It helped convince some Japanese Americans whod opposed the idea of reparations. But Yang says public opinion overall was not much of a factor. Japanese Americans at the time were only .5 of the population mostly in California and Hawaii. The campaign for reparations was really about persuading members of Congress and if there had been a lot of public opinion opposing it I think it might have affected them differently Yang says. Supporters of reparations for Black Americans consider a national program crucial. Explicitly racist federal policies were key in creating the wealth gap and only the federal government could come anywhere close to compensating for harms that some have calculated at as much as 14 trillion. Brown sees local reparations as part of an education campaign for a national push but others arent sure whether theyll help or hurt. Nteta at UMass Amherst believes some places are being mindful of the broad opposition to atoning for slavery. Evanston Illinois for example is providing housing grants for residents who faced discrimination. If that or another program is deemed successful he says perhaps a national roadmap will emerge. But Yale researcher Kraus says they could also prompt backlash and reinforce misperceptions about the wealth gap. People could even use local reparations events as evidence that things are moving too fast and unnaturally towards equality and so we need to stop and take a measured approach he says. Nteta already sees a general backlash. He says the debate over critical race theory and how to teach race in schools is part and parcel of the debate about reparations and yet another challenge to building support for them. He says he wouldnt rule out an eventual policy as young people more supportive of reparations replace older voters. But if it ever happens its going to be I think decades. In the Pew survey even most supporters of reparations considered them unlikely to happen in their lifetime. Become an NPR sponsor
https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/would-reparations-for-slavery-be-constitutional/2019/08/12/76677182-ba10-11e9-b3b4-2bb69e8c4e39_story.html, Increasingly advocates ask not if but how. Vox reports the main questions are what a reparations program would look like who would benefit who would pay and how it would be funded.  Maybe not. Any financial benefits awarded to African Americans in compensation for historical discrimination would collide with wellestablished Supreme Court precedents. That doctrine emerged out of two decades of affirmativeaction cases from the mid1970s to the mid1990s during which a centerright court wrestled with how much reverse discrimination against whites to allow for the sake of correcting black America s historical disadvantages. The court s answer not much. Under the 14th Amendment a raceconscious policy state or federal could be enacted only if it passed strict scrutiny that is if it was narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government interest through the least restrictive means available.  Diversity in higher education was a compelling interest the court ruled and could be addressed through admissions programs that took race into account but provided all applicants individualized consideration. In most contexts though the court required government to show that it was redressing harm clearly caused by a discriminatory policy and that government had exhausted other remedies before trying raceconscious ones. Justice Thurgood Marshall protested. A profound difference separates governmental actions that themselves are racist and governmental actions that seek to remedy the effects of prior racism or to prevent neutral governmental activity from perpetuating the effects of such racism he wrote. But Justice Sandra Day O Connor had the last word noting in 1995 that any individual suffers an injury when he or she is disadvantaged by the government because of his or her race whatever that race may be.  Union Army Gen. William T. Sherman s January 1865 Special Field Order 15 calling for redistribution of whiteowned lands to the freed slaves might have survived strict scrutiny because it compensated people personally victimized by slavery. Alas President Andrew Johnson reversed it by fiat. Also clearly constitutional reparations paid to Japanese Americans for their internment during World War II. Like Sherman s order this 1988 federal measure compensated the actual victims of a discrete policy. In his seminal 2014 Atlantic article The Case for Reparations TaNehisi Coates implied that the situation of African Americans today is essentially similar to that of the newly emancipated in 1865 or the World War II internees in that they still suffer not just from slavery but from much more recent policies such as mid20thcentury federally backed housing discrimination. Yet today s conservativemajority court would almost certainly note that subsequent legal reforms such as the 1968 Fair Housing Act or the 1977 Community Reinvestment Act mitigate societal or governmental accountability and weaken the link between past policy and current hardship. Even a notsoconservative jurist might worry that reparations compensate people who do not deserve or need it while excluding those who do. In 1989 Justice John Paul Stevens looked askance at the Richmond contracting setaside because it encompasses persons who have never been in business in Richmond minority contractors who may have been guilty of discriminating against members of other minority groups.  As for finding a plaintiff to claim harm from reparations courts have regularly granted whites and in a case against Harvard s admissions program Asians the right to sue for reverse discrimination. They would likely allow a member of a historically oppressed group to sue for being omitted from blacksonly reparations. A German American sued against compensation for Japanese Americans on the grounds that he too had been detained in World War II. The U.S. court of appeals in Washington ultimately denied his claim on the merits. Erwin Chemerinsky dean of the University of California at Berkeley School of Law suggests that reparations could be constitutional if framed as an award to descendants of slaves not African Americans. Problem What about descendants of preCivil War free people of color or immigrants from Africa and the West Indies? Alternatively reparations could take the form of a wealth transfer to all lowincome Americans which would disproportionately benefit black people. Any raceneutral plan however would defeat a principal symbolic goal of reparations national atonement for a uniquely racial historical sin.  America was built on the preferential treatment of white people 395 years of it Coates wrote in 2014. Vaguely endorsing a cuddly feelgood diversity does very little to redress this. Nevertheless that might be all that constitutional law permits. Read more from Charles Lane s archive follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.

I looked across my family and noticed the range of color and complexion and wondered about what my foremothers must have suffered at the hands of slave masters. And so when you talk about restorative justice in fleshandblood terms it means how do we restore people in terms of land sold? How do we restore a people in terms of dignity robbed? Bodies violated? Liberty taken? And so the question is real and is one that reverberates and resonates in 2022 for me. Linda Bilmes Intro The point is that if you are a Christmas tree grower and you have any problem with your Christmas tree crop or you are a sardine fisherman and there is any problem to your catch of sardines there is a program for you. The programs are everywhere. And they are normal they are part of the concept that when people are affected by something that impairs their livelihood or their health or their bodies that the government will step in and provide some compensation.

Restorative justice is also known as reparative justice or in the context of the experience of Black Americans from the first slave ships in the 1600s through to today simply reparations.

Cornell William Brooks Its good to be with you Ralph. Linda Bilmes Thank you Ralph. Delighted to be back. Ralph Ranalli I d like to start with this concept of restorative justice both in general and also in the context of the harms that have been suffered by Black Americans that started with slavery and that have continued through other forms of discrimination in the postslavery period in America. Can we start by broadly talking about why you launched this project on restorative justice and why it s important in the context of the Black experience in America? I think Id ask Cornell to take that one first.  Cornell William Brooks Sure. If I might... Let me ground the question when you speak of root restorative justice in terms of the Black experience in America just start with a bit of personal history. So my great greatgrandfather the Reverend Pompey Lavallie was born in slavery. He was enslaved until he was a small child. I recall eight nine years of age and his daughterinlaw my greatgrandmother made a blanket out of his britches out of patches of cloth from his pants. My greatgreatgrandfather slept under that blanket that quilt as a man. I slept under that blanket as a boy. And so I grew up with the understanding that my forebears were enslaved. I wondered as a child. What was that like? What did he go through?  When I became an adult I began to read slave narratives. I heard stories. I recall in my own family stories about land being taken injustices suffered. I looked across my family and noted the range of color and complexion and wondered about what my foremothers must have suffered at the hands of slave masters. And so when you talk about restorative justice in fleshandblood terms it means how do we restore people in terms of land sold? How do we restore a people in terms of dignity robbed? Bodies violated? Liberty taken? And so the question is real and is one that reverberates and resonates in 2022 for me. Ralph Ranalli Linda why do you think its important to approach this as a matter of restorative justice? Linda Bilmes What has struck me in studying government programs for many years is that the United States has a norm has a social norm and reading from the Oxford encyclopedia dictionary norm means a model pattern standard of social behavior that is accepted and expected. The United States has a norm a longstanding norm of providing reparatory compensation to individuals whove suffered harms all kinds of harms that are largely outside of their control.  And the entire population in the United States has experienced this norm over the last two years where when a pandemic outside of peoples control hit the country the government pretty much immediately on a bipartisan basis jumped in and started providing assistance to people directly through cash reparation to try and help in preparatory compensation for the fact that people couldnt go to work. They introduced massive programs to help small businesses. And taking aside how perfect or imperfect the programs were the point is that this is the norm and when we go through hundreds of government programs this is what we do. I got involved in this project to try and change the way we think about reparations for the harms inflicted over a long time on African Americans because its not unusual. In fact its the everyday normal thing that we do. Ralph Ranalli When I was studying up on your project it struck me that the notion of harms in this context is really complex because its both spread out over time some 400 years but also in multiple facets of peoples lives where those harms were manifested. I was thinking of it as harms in two dimensions both breadth and length and I thought we might talk about breadth first. To illustrate that you ve developed a system of categorization of those harms you call it a taxonomy which includes areas like housing labor criminal punishment healthcare education violence and disenfranchisement. Can you talk about why it was an important foundational step to catalog those harms so comprehensively? Cornell William Brooks So Ralph I think its really important to talk about this taxonomy alongside if you will the understanding that most people have of slavery. That is to say it was a bad thing that happened a long time ago that ended with the emancipation proclamation and the 13th Amendment. Nothing could be further from the truth. So we created this taxonomy of harms as a way of illustrating depicting the range of harms and to be very clear here the range of brutality suffered. So when we talk about harms in terms of slavery in terms of the criminal context what that means is that people were enslaved prior to the emancipation proclamation and prior to the 13th Amendment literally in chains in shackles but after slavery was formally abolished you had the convict leasing system in excess of a million people who were also enslaved. That is to say if you commit any minor infraction the state literally confiscates your body and rents it out to companies like U.S. Steel. So a harm in terms of the criminal legal system. In terms of housing we have enslaved people having no housing and even when they were free they slept on the ground. Okay? But then after that our government was in the business of literally subsidizing segregation keeping Black folks out of not only the rental and sales of housing but also access to finance for decades and decades. In other words the federal government was aiding and abetting the exclusion of Black folks from housing. When we think about the violence that Black people endure it wasnt merely the violence prior to the emancipation proclamation and the 13th Amendment. It was also the violence aided and embedded by the government which is to say the Southern police departments their institutional predecessors were literally the slave patrols. And so the point being is this taxonomy categorizes the harms so that people might literally see the brutality of the harms the cost imposed on bodies and financial wellbeing of individuals and families. And I might note here that this taxonomy of harms displays breadth in terms of different categories but also the ways in which those categories interact. Right? So in other words think about Ida B. Wells right? The pioneering Black woman who documented lynchings all across the country. Well why did she leave her hometown of Memphis? Well there were those who literally lynched her colleagues confiscated their businesses and caused Blacks to flee en masse from the city of Memphis. So there was violence there was the dispossession in terms of peoples homes the destruction of a community the destruction of a local economy. In other words the harms are broad but they in fact interact. Ralph Ranalli I was really struck by the example that you used of the GI Bill. And that s in part because I would say most Americans view the GI Bill through some very rosecolored historical glasses how it was this wonderful thing that gave all the soldiers and sailors coming back from World War II a head start and it gave birth to a more prosperous postwar middle class. In fact members of my own extended family benefited significantly from it. But what I didn t fully know about was that it also had these negative interconnected ripple effects on Black America that impacted not just education but also housing and labor. What did you find when you examined the GI Bill? Linda Bilmes The GI Bill is a very powerful example of how interrelated all of these harms are. So in the GI Bill there were 16 million Americans who were mobilized in World War II when the original GI Bill was enacted including 1.2 million African Americans. And the GI Bill provided a number of benefits to those who returned to all those who were honorably discharged including very substantially subsidized mortgages and very substantially free and subsidized education. But most Black GIs almost all were unable to take advantage of the GI Bill benefits. You have to really understand what happened because it wasnt that the GI Bill was written specifically to exclude Blacks. But what happened is that first of all there was a decision made to enable this thing to be implemented by the states. And many states absolutely were unwilling including Massachusetts to include Blacks in the education part of the GI Bill. But in addition to that there was already a huge amount of discrimination in housing and home insurance through redlining and so forth. And so even if one were able to secure a GI Bill mortgage there was an enormous amount of restriction in terms of where you could actually use it. In addition the education opportunities that were available to Black GIs were pretty much entirely restricted at that time to very small historically Black colleges and universities which were small and didnt have capacity and had only a very small number of academic disciplines in which people could study. And of the seven million World War II GIs for example who took advantage of the education five million of them went into the vocations and the trades and most of the trades excluded Blacks at that time. So you had this enormous game changer in the middle of the century that enabled many Italian and Polish and Irish and Jewish and other immigrants and first generation Americans to become part of the middle class who were able to buy a home and to go and get an education based on the GI Bill. Including my father who fought in the Army in the Pacific during World War II. But this was almost entirely denied to the more than a million Black GIs who fought in those wars. And that basically the same thing happened during the Korean War where about 10 of the GIs were Black. And once again were not able to take advantage of the GI Bill. Cornell William Brooks Ralph if I might footnote Lindas description with the illustration of this right? So when we think about the oldest World War II veteran having recently passed who was African American. Who served this country won a number of medals but who did not receive any housing benefits no educational benefits. That was a direct harm to him but it also impacted his family. So when Linda speaks about the limited offerings of historically Black colleges what that meant was in the absence of schools of engineering law schools and medical schools those were doctors that were not trained. Lawyers that were not trained. Engineers that were not trained. Architects that were not trained. That is to say professionals who were not in place to serve their communities contribute to their families. So the intergenerational consequences of this are profound and massive. Ralph Ranalli Actually Im really glad you brought that up Cornell because that was the length issue that I really wanted to tackle next which is this intergenerational context. How do you make the best case for restorative justice when youre talking about the intergenerational aspect? Because it seems to me that is the most difficult piece of it for many people to grasp relate to take the heart however you would put it. It s the old Well I didn t enslave anyone why should I pay for reparations? argument. Cornell William Brooks I like to illustrate this simply because the costing out the harms is a challenge but it doesnt necessarily lead to clarity. Let me give you an example. My father served in the United States Army as a field artillery officer. I was born at Fort Bliss in El Paso Texas. My father benefited from GI Bill was able to purchase a house. He went to medical school as a consequence of the GI Bill. He received an ROTC scholarship as a consequence of the GI Bill. My wifes father served before him. He was older. He was seeing none of those benefits. Im reaping the benefits of my fathers service and his access to the GI Bill. Those who preceded him did not have such opportunities. And as a consequence literally they started with less. And so in terms of restorative justice if we narrow the lens to the individual we see before us we literally obscure and cloud and diminish the harm of the people and families and communities who have suffered. Ralph Ranalli This is also a great segue into talking about our existing national context in which we have both traditions and norms of redressing harms including programs that stretch across generation to generation like Veterans and Indian Affairs Programs. What are those examples of how we as a country are already redressing intergenerational harms? Linda Bilmes Well just to go back to the GI Bill for a second. One of the principles of the GI Bill as its currently constructed is that for those who have served and who cannot use or do not wish to use their educational benefits those benefits are passed through to their children. Now that was something that if we just thought about the GI Bill benefits that were denied to the 1.7 million Black Americans who fought in World War II and the Korean War their children are basically alive today and were not given that benefit that others were allowed to. So its difficult to compare in some ways because in most programs you dont have as much interconnection of harms as you do with the set of harms facing Black Americans. But in most programs there are provisions for descendants to benefit to be beneficiaries. So as we were writing the paper last year there was a woman who died at the age of 110 who was the beneficiary of a veteran who had fought in the Civil War. She was the daughter of somebody who had fought in the Civil War who had been elderly when he had had her. And she had been receiving a pension for all of her life. He had fought for the South and then fought for the North or maybe it was the other way around but he had fought on both sides and she was receiving a lifetime pension through until about a year and a half ago. So the principle that benefits should be intergenerational and should be passed is not present in every program but is present in many programs. And we have tried to broaden the lens to look not only at those harms that were racially motivated but to look at a full range of harms and to look at how those benefits can continue for many years to descendants for people who have been harmed by a very wide range of factors outside of their control. Ralph Ranalli Do you think the average person would be surprised by the number of programs that actually redress various forms of harm intergenerational or direct? What are some examples of some programs that people might not know about might not think about? Linda Bilmes Sure. The United States provides and were just talking about the federal government here. There are hundreds of programs and we provide repertory compensation to victims of workplace injuries to those exposed to radiation to pesticides to people who develop diseases due to their employment like black lung disease to anyone whose livelihood is reduced or destroyed due to disasters or weather events or floods droughts pests people who are impacted by trade agreements farmers whose crops are suffering due to almost anything insects crop disease weather fishermen whose catch is reduced due to many factors. People who have lost homes or had their livelihood impacted by all kinds of disasters. We ensure peoples bank accounts up to 250000 per account to ensure against bank failures. We pay for people whove lost pensions. There is a really wide range of different programs that we provide. But let me just give you a couple of examples. Ones that are very close to home are that we have a national vaccine injury compensation program which provides compensation for people who have had injuries that were presumed to be caused by any vaccine that the CDC recommends. And so anybody who received a vaccine who has a bad reaction or who dies their family can file a petition. This is funded by an excise tax on each dose of the vaccine which is paid by the manufacturing companies paid into a trust fund which is managed by the U.S. Treasury. And there have been more than 5 billion paid out on that fund. Now that fund for example is only one fund. There is another fund which covers all injuries or bad side effects due to COVID19 vaccines called the Countermeasures Injury Compensation Program which compensates unreimbursed medical expenses lost earnings survivor death benefits for any injuries due to the vaccine or medication or devices for COVID19 vaccines or other vaccines that have been introduced since 2010. Now I could go through my database here which would be very boring but I could go through a hundred different programs. But the point is that if you are a Christmas tree grower and you have any problem with your Christmas tree crop or you are a sardine fisherman and there is any problem with your catch of sardines there is a program for you. The programs are everywhere and they are normal. They are part of the concept that when people are affected by something that impairs their livelihood or their health or their bodies that the government will step in and provide some compensation. Ralph Ranalli And like you said that s by no means the exhaustive list. And we are surrounded by those programs all the time and I think most people walk around all the time thinking Well of course those make sense. And yet Cornell when you call it reparations and you put it in the context of the Black experience in America it almost becomes like some idea that came from Mars. And these other examples of what is essentially the same activity are around us every day and seem perfectly normal. How do you account for that gap in people relating those things to each other? Cornell William Brooks Let me note this The obvious is in fact hidden in plain sight. What we mean by that is a couple things. This is fundamentally a definition problem. We conceive the term repertory compensation to describe what is ordinary in routine which is to say that the federal government recognizes a harm responds to that harm by trying to make a person or their descendants if not whole then better. So its a definition challenge. But its also a numerosity and a diversity challenge which is to say the sheer numerosity of the programs and the diversity of the programs that is to say recognizing a wide variety of harms causes people to think that that has nothing to do with these harms which are targeted on a people and are racial in nature. And so they think A has nothing to do with B when in fact A is simply a subset of B. In other words the same housing harms that you see with respect to Black people as a consequence of discrimination are housing harms also recognize through federal programs. The health harms visit upon Black people as a consequence of discrimination and slavery and the aftermath of slavery are not related to health harms we see elsewhere. And so the challenge here is to help people to appreciate this longstanding operative norm in the government of recognizing harms accounting for those harms calculating those harms and literally devising a response to those harms. And last note here is if you look at the support for reparations 50 years ago 20 years ago it was a fraction of what it is now which is to say among young people we have more than 50 who support reparations. So in other words theres both a growing acceptance of the notion of reparations and a growing understanding of the need for reparations based on repertory compensation. Linda Bilmes Can I just jump in for a second here? I just want to pick up on what Cornell said about this being a definitional issue. When you look at all of these programs that Im talking about and you actually look at the statute they are very much based on the idea that people really suffered and they should be compensated. So for example looking at a program here for a Department of Energy contractor and subcontractor employees who had anything to do with the Nuclear Defense Program and encountered any toxins. The statute says since World War II hundreds of thousands of men and women have served their nation in building its nuclear defense thousands of these courageous Americans however paid a high price for their service developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to barium radiation and other hazards et cetera. And then it says while the nation can never fully repay these workers or their families they deserve recognition and compensation for their sacrifices. Now we have already paid out 21 billion in medical and financial compensation to more than 132000 workers who were exposed to radiation and so forth as part of the program that the government has been running for all these years around nuclear weapons and which is something that I completely agree with.  I think the question that you are posing is how is it that we have all of these programs. They are everywhere they are commonplace. They are conceived of as you can hear by the statutes in the same way that we think about other harms as harms around sacrifices compensation recognition. And yet the group of individuals who have been most harmed by federal policies has not received this recognition and compensation. Ralph Ranalli I wanted to turn for a second to the forms in the future that the two of you are envisioning those reparative measures could take? I know one example was an excise tax on banks to make up for historic discrimination in mortgage lending. Can you explain how that would work? And maybe give me a couple more examples of some forms that reparations could take? Linda Bilmes Cornell do you want to start that one or do you want me to start that one? Cornell William Brooks So in terms of an excise tax I just want to note here that these are not 2022 projections in terms of what might be done. Let us go back to the early 1900s when a woman by the name of Callie G. House who was born into slavery as a child grew up in Tennessee led reparations grassroots movement numbering more than 300000. She was not a graduate of the Harvard Law School but she mounted litigation that essentially called on the federal government to take the tax collected on cotton harvested by enslaved people and use that based upon the same benefit system according to Civil War soldiers to be awarded to those who were formerly enslaved. So now coming into 2022 this many years later where we know Blacks and I know this certainly is a fair housing lawyer and certainly from the history of fair housing in this country and fair lending Blacks have been routinely categorically excluded from credit markets from housing rental markets for generations aided and abetted by the federal government. One could imagine an excise tax being used to give Black people an opportunity to literally have a stake in that which they were excluded from particularly when we understand that having a home owning a home is a foundational pillar of intergenerational wealth. So in other words what might be done today is deeply rooted in American history. Linda Bilmes I would say that one of the things that we have tried to show in our paper is that there are dozens of funding mechanisms that are being used right now in these many different programs that we used to provide preparatory compensation for different types of harms. And so if we think about this the way the government thinks about other harms if we normalize the issue of thinking about reparations for Black Americans we have a large menu of different mechanisms and its not a onesizefitsall situation. I think that there is an enormous wealth gap which William Darity the economist and others have documented. And this is the result of many different harms over a long period of time that have compounded and interacted and multiplied. And so therefore we have to begin to think about what are the best inflection points in which to try and address this enormous gap. And to start beginning to think about the menu. But just to take one example our friends Seth Moulton Congressman Moulton and Congressman Clyburn and Senator Raphael Warnock have introduced the Sergeant Isaac Woodard Jr. and Sergeant Joseph H. Maddox GI Bill Restoration Act which they introduced on Veterans Day of November 2021 so just a couple months ago which would provide the benefits the educational benefits of the GI Bill to the descendants of Black Americans who served in World War II but who were denied the GI Bill benefits. And this is the thinking that I personally believe that most Americans would say Wow we have a defined group of Americans who are the children of GIs who fought in World War II were very decorated. In many cases fought honorably were discharged honorably and through no fault of their own were denied the GI Bill benefits. Absolutely they should be able to go to school and get those benefits that their parents werent able to. So this is the thinking that we need to... This is just one small example its not small but one example. But this is the thinking that begins to apply what we know about everything else the government does to this issue. Cornell William Brooks Ralph might I note this The reason why the breadth of funding mechanisms for reparatory compensation are important is because they speak to the feasibility of recognizing these racial harms. So in other words among the arguments against reparations is the notion that slavery happens so long ago or there are too many people who have been harmed or it is simply impossible to recognize that harm or to pay for it. What weve done in this paper is to make clear that we have an expertise in recognizing harms identifying those who are harmed and paying for it in the tune to the tune of millions billions even trillions of dollars and where Lindas great expertise is critically important here is by illustrating the sheer breadth and diversity of the funding mechanisms. It goes to our capability as a country to recognize these harms and to respond in ways that are practical feasible conceivable and doable in 2022. Ralph Ranalli So I want to turn to the political and moral moment we find ourselves in. Cornell you went on a 12day hunger strike earlier this year to bring attention to the fight in Congress over voting rights. Why did you feel compelled to do that? And how does it if at all relate to this broader effort for restorative justice? Cornell William Brooks So let us know this voting rights and reparations as challenges to our Republic have everything to do with memory and history which is to say to the extent that we dont have a public memory and profound understanding of history when it comes to voting rights we are then cursed doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. In other words the voter suppression of the 2020s looks like the voter suppression of the 1990s and the 1940s. And let me know parenthetically my grandfather the Reverend James Edmund Prioleau who ran for Congress in 1946. Now here I am his grandson fighting that fight. So in part that hunger strike was motivated inspired by a need to remind people of the gravity the seriousness the stakes of the right to vote. Now with respect to reparations and why these two are connected is because the denial of the right to vote is a racial harm. In other words when you keep people out of the ballot box they are less well positioned in our democracy to protect their bodies their property their communities. Those harms or impose on bodies communities and property and as a consequence literally create the predicate for reparations. So these are not two disconnected things but they in fact very much connected. And if you notice in our research we link norms physical practice and history and morality right? So in other words we talk about Callie G. House and the 1900s and the late 1800s. But we also talk about what we are doing in Washington D.C. in terms recognizing the harms endured by Americans every day. So much so that in our paper we essentially say if repertory compensation is routine and normal why would we consider reparations to be aberration and exceptional? Ralph Ranalli Ive always been interested in the concept of truth and reconciliation commissions and the fact that they have never seemed to gain traction in the United States despite there being what would appear to be numerous potential opportunities in our history. But we have seen them help affect change around the world from South Africa to Argentina from Chile to New Zealand to South Korea. And they re all built on the fundamental notion that you can t have reconciliation healing if you will without first embracing truth. Now in the context of the Black historical experience in America I think you could make a case that reparations are essentially truth as a verb a kind of physical manifestation of us collectively accepting the truth of Americas racial past. I m interested to hear what both of you think have been the moral costs of not accepting that truth and redressing it before now? And what do you think those costs will be in the future if we continue to not address and redress them? Linda do you want to tackle that first? Linda Bilmes I serve as the U.S. member of the United Nation Committee of Experts. And there are 24 countries that are represented on that body. And the United Nations has laid out a number of general norms around understanding what reparations are including acknowledgement and redress and compensation and widening how we really think about the categories of reparations. They call for restitution compensation rehabilitation satisfaction and guarantees of nonrepetition. And many of those who have been involved in the United Nations for example Michelle Bachelet the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported that countries need to take action on ending systemic racism including financial restitution rehabilitation acknowledgement of injustices apologies memorialization educational reforms reparations.  This is a largescale effort. And I think that we are taking on one piece of this larger picture. What it seems to me as someone who... I am a Quaker and Ive spent a lot of time in silence trying to think about this issue. One of the steps that we should take that is entirely consistent with the way this country deals with harms and always has dealt with acknowledged harm is by providing financial restitution for acknowledged harms which doesnt mean that there isnt an enormously larger universe of things that need to be done which may involve truth and reconciliation commissions and thinking and so forth. But I see among our students at the Kennedy School and among young people a strong desire to begin trying to work towards a larger arc of justice. And I think that its impossible to do that without acknowledging upfront that the enormous wealth gap between Black Americans and others is a result of very well documented discrimination laws procedures implementations sometimes overt sometimes indirectly con caused and that all of these things that the housing and the education and wages and healthcare and criminal justice and voting rights and lead paint are all interrelated to each other creating this wealth gap. And without taking on that giant elephant in the room we are not going to make progress. And that there is an enormous amount of precedent for being able to do this. Ralph Ranalli Cornell We ll let you have the last word. Is there a moral cost to be paid for continuing to not address these historic harms? Cornell William Brooks Absolutely. And the moral cost is shockingly and disturbingly high. And what we mean by that is to not tell the story in both nouns and numbers is to ignore the story ignore the harm and for the harm to literally fester and grow worse and deeper. So when we think about the South African truth and reconciliation commission led by the late Bishop Desmond Tutu it began with stories then proceeded to compensation. When we think about Japanese internment victims in the United States that process began with stories then proceeded with compensation. When we think about the civil rights cases that have been brought in the courts all across this country I began my career as a civil prosecutor in the civil rights division of the justice department under thenAssistant Attorney General Deval Patrick. Every case began with a complaint where which was essentially a story then proceeded to compensation. What we have in this country is both a muffling and immuring of story and a denial of compensation. The deafening silence with respect to a lack of compensation lack of recognition lack of acknowledgement of the harm manifests itself in so many ways in which literally we as a republic are doomed and cursed to repeat the mistakes of the past in the present. And so the moral cost is extraordinarily high. And so I want to just say to the listeners of this podcast in this paper in our research you have numbers and nouns stories and budgets side by side both of which all of which tells a story that needs to be told and identifies and calls into who calls us to acknowledge a harm that should be recognized in terms of literally healing and going back to the root of repertory compensation and reparations it calls for repair and the making whole. Ralph Ranalli Well thank you both. To my mind there aren t a lot of conversations that are more important than this one and I ve enjoyed it very much. I really appreciate you both being here and good luck with your work. We look forward to seeing the paper. Ralph Ranalli Outro Thanks for listening.
