https://stanfordmag.org/contents/should-we-abolish-the-electoral-college,  Reading time min   Illustration Steve Dinnino   000 000 1.0x Editor s Note In 2016 we asked two professors to debate whether the Electoral College should cease to be the mechanism used for selecting the U.S. president. Here are the yea and the nay. By Jack Rakove the William Robertson Coe Professor of History and American Studies and a professor of political science. In this extraordinarily strange election year debating the Electoral College might seem an odd pastime when so many other issues concern us. But its logic its distortion of the democratic process and its underlying flaws will still strongly influence the conduct of the election. So let me make the case for its abolition and its replacement by a simple national popular vote to be held in an entity we will call what the heck the United States of America. There are three basic arguments in favor of the system the framers of the Constitution gave us with little sense of how it would actually work. The first is easily dismissed. Presidential electors are not more qualified than other citizens to determine who should head the government. They are simply party loyalists who do not deliberate about anything more than where to eat lunch. A second argument holds less populous states deserve the further electoral weight they gain through the senatorial bump giving each state two electors because their minority status entitles them to additional political protection. But the real interests of smallstate voters are never determined by the relative size of the population of their states. If say environmental sustainability or abortion or the Second Amendment is your dominant concern it does not matter whether you live in Wyoming or California Pennsylvania or Delaware. The size of a state does not affect our real political preferences even though the Electoral College system imagines that it does. Third defenders of the Electoral College also claim that it supports the underlying value of federalism. Having the states play an autonomous role in presidential elections it is said reinforces the division of governing authority between the nation and the states. But explaining exactly how it does this remains a mystery. Having a statebased system for electing both houses of Congress should be adequate to that task. Presidential elections have little if anything to do with the subject even when some candidates claim to be running against Washington.  What are the positive arguments in favor of replacing the existing electoral system with a national popular vote? Here again there are three main points to make. Having the states play an autonomous role in presidential elections it is said reinforces the division of governing authority between the nation and the states. But explaining exactly how it does this remains a mystery. First and most obviously such a system would conform to the dominant democratic value that has prevailed in American politics ever since the oneperson onevote reapportionment rulings of the early 1960s. Our votes would count the same wherever they were cast. No other mode of presidential elections would be fully consistent with our underlying commitment to the equality of all citizens. Second a national popular vote would eliminate the battleground state phenomenon that has now become the key feature of postconvention campaigning leaving most Americans alienated from the decisive phase of presidential elections. Swing or battleground states are mere accidents of geography. They do not matter because they have any special civic characteristics. They simply happen to be states that become competitive because of their demography and which are readily identifiable as such because of the increasing sophistication of political polling. In a truly national election parties and candidates would have the incentive to turn out their votes wherever they were fostering a deeper sense of engagement across the whole population. Third a national election might provide a cure for the delegitimation of presidential authority that has afflicted the last three presidencies. It is no secret that the administrations of Bill Clinton George W. Bush and Barack Obama all suffered from the outset from efforts to imply that there was something improper and unworthy or even suspicious in their elections. That same view will doubtless color the 2016 election as well. This perception is reinforced by the red and bluestate imagery that controls our view of the electoral process. Having an election in which victory went to a candidate carrying a single national constituency might not wholly cure this problem but it might well work to mitigate it. By Michael W. McConnell the Richard and Frances Mallery Professor of Law director of the Constitutional Law Center and a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution. The Electoral College is not going to be changed and there are far more urgent and promising topics for reform of our presidential selection system. It is true that the Electoral College no longer serves its original purposes and that it creates a grave risk that a candidate not favored by a majority of the people will from time to time be elected president. There have been three John Quincy Adams Benjamin Harrison and George W. Bush. We survived. Not one was a firstrank president but their selection did not seriously injure the democratic character of our system. The founders opted for the Electoral College because the two leading alternatives election by Congress and by popular vote were thought to have serious defects. Moreover the electoral college method preserved the two compromises over representation the threefifths clause and the big statesmall state compromise and guarded against a fracturing of votes for many candidates which they thought might occur once George Washington was no longer available as a nationally respected consensus candidate. The threefifths clause became irrelevant with the end of slavery thankfully! and the big statesmall state divide no longer animates our politics if it ever did. The twoparty system solves the fractured vote problem more effectively than the Electoral College ever did and the electors never exercised genuine independence. The Electoral College thus presents democratic risks without serving any of its original purposes. That is not to say the Electoral College is without its advantages. It gives a slight edge to candidates with broadbased support in many states over those who rack up huge majorities in just a few large states. That probably promotes a more national and less regional vision. It channels presidential politics into a twoparty system which is superior to multiparty systems where fringe factions can exercise too much leverage. It probably reduces the cost of presidential campaigns by confining television advertising to the battleground states and spares the rest of us the tedium of endless repetitive ads. And it confines votecounting disputes to just one or maybe a few states. Imagine a Floridastyle recount in every precinct in America. Still the advantages are uncertain and relatively minor. Almost no one would adopt an Electoral College today if we were starting from scratch. But reforming the Electoral College does not rank high among our national problems. Given that a change would require a twothirds vote of both houses of Congress and threequarters of the state legislatures it is not going to happen. We should be talking about other things. The great problems with our presidential selection system today stem from the haphazard way we choose the two major party presidential candidates. This year is the poster child for the need for reform. The two parties have chosen the same year in which to nominate a person whom large numbers of Americans probably a majority regard as unfit though not for the same reason. Generally we count on the Republican and Democratic parties to nominate not the best people but candidates who combine a degree of popular support with the experience and temperament to govern. Not this year. Almost no one would adopt an Electoral College today if we were starting from scratch. But reforming the Electoral College does not rank high among our national problems. We need to think hard and quickly about how to reform three aspects of the presidential nomination process the debates the primary elections and the conventions. The current system is weighted too heavily in favor of celebrity appeal demagogic displays and appeals to narrow special interests. The party structures which for all their faults have a vested interest in candidates from the moderate middle who are able to work with Congress and other officials to govern have been sidelined. For almost the first half century of the republic presidential candidates were chosen by the caucuses of the two parties in the House and the Senate. That system worked well until the twoparty system briefly died with the Federalist Party. It was replaced by party conventions which eventually were replaced almost with strings of single or multiple state primaries and caucuses. It seems to me that the original system may have been superior to what we now have. The elected officials of both parties have incentives to choose candidates with an eye toward popular electability and governing skill. Interestingly the congressional caucus system is very close to the system the British used to replace Prime Minister David Cameron. Most Americans would breathe a sigh of relief I believe if we had a system capable of choosing the U.S. equivalent of Theresa May instead of Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton. Now is the time for sober and spirited citizens from both parties to devise a new system for 2020. As American leadership falters scholars say autocrats are on the rise. A New Mexico doctor describes the pain and horror of caring for COVID19 patients. Social change can seem sudden as if millions awoke one day to the same realization. But really scholars say consensus is constructed through thousands of small acts over generations.  Frances C. Arrillaga Alumni Center 326 Galvez Street Stanford CA 943056105 Map

THE CURRENT ELECTION SEASON in the United States has highlighted many of the problems with the country s current election system from convoluted campaign finance practices to stringent voter identification requirements the process is fraught with complications. As the presidential election draws closer many Americans are reluctant to trust the electoral process at all. In a new working paper published in the Harvard Kennedy School HKS Faculty Working Paper series Pippa Norris the Paul F. McGuire Lecturer in Comparative Politics at HKS offers some potential solutions to the many challenges plaguing American elections. Norris is founder of the Electoral Integrity Project based jointly at Harvard and Sydney University in Australia which she established in 2012 following several contentious election cycles in the early 2000s. The project seeks to assess and analyze electoral problems and gather systematic evidence about the quality of electoral processes around the world. Assessing the U.S. elections in 2012 and 2014 the EIP found that those elections displayed the worst performances among Western democracies. Norris cites multiple reasons for this such as increasing polarization of the two major political parties the deregulation of campaign finance contributions by individuals and corporations and a general lack of public confidence in the electoral process and its outcomes.  Without urgent reform these problems risk damaging the legitimacy of American elections further weakening public confidence in the major political parties Congress and the US government depressing voter turnout and exacerbating the risks of contentious outcomes fought through court appeals and public protests Norris argues. Norris offers several potential reforms to address these problems beginning with an overhaul of the regulations surrounding voter registration and balloting and the presence of independent impartial and professional electoral management. She also questions the existing infrastructure for implementing electoral laws and regulations. In the U.S. voter regulations are mostly handled at the local level but Norris argues that strengthening the role and responsibilities of the U.S. Electoral Assistance Commission could do a better job of managing electoral processes. After new regulations are put into place the process would need to be monitored and revised as necessary she says. In any case Norris argues a thorough reimagining of the electoral process is the best hope for reversing the decline of confidence in U.S. elections and their outcomes.  Piecemeal reforms will not be adequate to compensate for growing party polarization and declining public confidence Norris writes. Matters of electoral governance should not be determined through laws enacted by selfinterested partisan representatives in state houses the equivalent to putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop. Instead the reform process needs to engage us all.  Get smart reliable public policy insights right in your inbox. 
https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2024/03/13/electoral-reform-and-direct-democracy/, Many people link these changes to greater citizen representation whether it s because they allow people to vote more easily or because their votes can be more readily and accurately converted into representation. But some people take it even a step further arguing for their country to have more direct democracy. Particularly in France and Germany where direct democracy is the secondmost suggested change people want to have more chances to vote via referenda on topics that matter to them. Changing the electoral system appears in the top five ranked issues in seven of the 24 countries surveyed. In Canada Nigeria and the UK the issue ranks second among the 17 substantive topics coded. In six countries those who do not support the governing party or parties are more likely to mention electoral reform than those who do support such parties. In the UK for example where electoral reform is ranked second only to politicians 17 of those who do not support the ruling Conservative Party mention electoral reform compared with 6 of Conservative Party supporters. For more information on how we classify governing party supporters refer to Appendix D. However in the U.S. and Israel this pattern is reversed Those who do support the governing parties are more likely than those who do not to mention electoral reform as an improvement to democracy.  People should have the right to choose their leaders through a free and fair election.  Across the countries surveyed people want to see a wide range of electoral reforms. Some of these focus on the logistics of casting votes how and when people vote and who is eligible. Others focus more on changing the electoral system referencing issues like electoral thresholds and gerrymandering. And some emphasize the need to ensure free and fair elections. In Nigeria and Brazil people who are not confident that their recent national elections were conducted fairly and accurately as asked in a separate question in Brazil Kenya and Nigeria are more likely to bring up electoral reform. Some of the calls for electoral reform center specifically on how ballots are cast. For example some see benefits to electronic voting options over paper ballots especially as a tool to protect elections Use modernized technology to help in security of the voting system said one Kenyan woman. Others see electronic ballots as an issue of convenience particularly if it means one can vote from the comfort of their own house. As one Canadian man put it I think people should be able to vote electronically using the internet and telephone instead of going to a polling station. It makes it more convenient.  Still in some places that have electronic voting respondents raise concerns about this method. End the electronic ballot box said a Brazilian woman. A man in India expressed his preference for paper ballots The use of electronic voting machines should be stopped and bring paper ballots back so that transparent democracy will be seen.  For some Americans increased access to absentee or mailin voting is a specific electoral change they want to see Making votebymail standard in every state giving voters time to vote at their convenience rather than having to miss work. It also gives them the time to research candidates at their leisure. Others in the U.S. oppose mailin voting Stop voter fraud! Go back to voting on Election Day. Enough with this allmonth voting and mailin votes wrote one American woman. Stop mailin ballots unless for military or another exempt person echoed a man. There are large partisan divides in U.S. views of voting methods and more Democrats cast absentee votes than Republicans. People also see the need to change the frequency of elections. Some request fewer elections so that officeholders spend less of their term campaigning for reelection One Australian man wanted to lengthen the period between federal elections to five years. Others want to see more elections like a Canadian woman who said Do not have an election every four years it should be every two years or a Nigerian woman who wanted her government to conduct elections every two years or frequently. One South African woman went so far as to say Elections should be held every year.  Some in the U.S. where national elections are held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday of November call for making Election Day a holiday. The U.S. is one of few advanced economies that does not hold elections over the weekend or designate the day a national holiday. For example one American man said Create a national voting holiday to ensure every American has a chance to vote. Another person said Eliminate voter suppression. Make Election Day a national holiday. Make voting as easy as mailing a letter.  Making changes to who is allowed to participate in elections is another means people see to improve their democracy. For example some want to alter the age at which citizens become eligible to cast their votes. For those who want to lower it the argument centers around allowing more young people to participate in elections Lowering the voting age to 16 now young people have more stake in the game suggested a Canadian man. An American man had a similar opinion saying I think lowering the age for voting would help democracy because many teens as young as 16 already have views about policies in the U.S.  Not all are in favor of lowering the voting age however. As one Swedish man put it Raise the voting age. People at 18 need to take their electoral mandate more seriously.   There should be a voter s license and voters should take a civics test. Informed voting is the crux of democracy.  Others feel voters need to pass a knowledge test in order to cast a vote. The right to vote should be bound by educational attainment said a man in Hungary. An Italian man said Those who want to vote should pass a test of general culture before the elections. And a woman in Sweden was specific on this policy One should know what you re voting for a little mini test so you know what you re voting for. A driver s license to vote. For more on perceived citizen responsibility read Chapter 4. In some countries though there are calls to protect people s existing right to vote. In the U.S. where voter suppression has become an electoral issue several people were vocal about protecting the right to vote. Abolish state laws that restrict voters rights suggested one American man. An Australian man focused specifically on protecting voting rights for Aboriginal people Ensure Indigenous voters have the opportunity to vote in all circumstances. Certain respondents even want to enfranchise new types of voters Open the right to vote to all permanent residents such as all Europeans who live in France said one French woman.  To oblige every citizen to vote and influence according to law.  Respondents in some places went as far as suggesting that voting in elections and referenda be required as a means to improve democracy. One Greek woman said All citizens should be forced to vote on very important laws and decisions for the country. A man in the Netherlands saw mandatory voting as a way to improve voter turnout Compulsory voting should be reintroduced. For provincial council elections turnout is only 50 to 60. Introducing compulsory voting could improve this.  Still not everyone who lives in a country that has mandatory voting approves of it. Don t make it compulsory to vote for someone. That way the people who really care will have their vote and those who don t care won t just pick the first person on the sheet or the one with the best name with no idea who they are voting for said one Australian woman. Another Australian shared a similar view I would like to see the scrapping of compulsory voting as this will mean political parties will need to work harder for votes. And in Argentina where voting is mandatory for most citizens some respondents called for its overhaul that voting is not compulsory.   Election law reform. Stop voting by region and switch to a national election where one can choose the winner based on the highest number of votes nationwide.  People also call for a different style of voting than they currently have. For example some focus on implementing a firstpastthepost voting system in which people vote for a single candidate and the candidate with the most votes wins. As one Australian man put it Introduce firstpastthepost voting dispensing with preferential voting as the minor parties are making every government difficult to operate.  Other people value proportional representation a system where politicians hold the number of seats proportional to their party s support in the voting population. Reintroduce the proportional representation voting system and ensure accountability by elected officials said a South African man. And a French woman said All representatives should be elected by proportional representation.  Some expressed frustration with ballots listing a choice of parties instead of specific candidates as in the case of a Swedish man who said Direct election of people not parties. It is better to vote for a person you know what they think. An Australian agreed Enhancing the electoral process for Australians to vote for candidates and less for their parties.  There are also calls for things like rankedchoice voting Rankedchoice voting would limit extremism. and tworound voting The kind of tworound voting system would improve democracy. . But no one system necessarily satisfies everyone. In some countries that already have firstpastthepost voting for example there are requests to eliminate it Get rid of firstpastthepost. The electoral system needs reform so that the representation by popular votes should have some weight said one man in Canada. One Japanese woman said Abolish the singleseat constituency system referring to a type of voting that includes firstpastthepost where one winner represents one electoral district.  The electoral threshold should be raised there should be fewer and larger parties.  Changes to the electoral threshold or the minimum share of votes needed for a candidate or party to provide representation is suggested by some as a way to improve democracy particularly among those who live in countries with low thresholds and fragmented party systems. In Israel where the 3.25 electoral threshold leads to many parties participating in each election one woman said Significantly increase the electoral threshold.  This sentiment is echoed in the Netherlands where the 0.67 threshold is the lowest in the world. One Dutch man said I think a high electoral threshold would be good. This could lead to less fragmentation and speed up decisionmaking. Another Dutch man saw this change as a means to improve the overall quality of elections Raise the electoral threshold so that there will be more substance. That way not everyone can just start a party. The Dutch survey was conducted prior to November 2023 elections in which the farright Party for Freedom PVV won the most seats in the House of Representatives. Revising the borders of electoral districts is a reform some think could help increase voter representation. Gerrymandering for example a term coined in the U.S. to describe the practice of drawing electoral district boundaries in a way that creates an advantage for one party over another is something that people in multiple countries flagged as a problem. For example an Australian man said If we were to ban gerrymandering then each political group would have an equal chance to be elected. In the U.S. one man said It would help if we got rid of gerrymandering and the Electoral College and things that suppress the majority.  For others voter representation is not just about physical electoral districts but about correcting a perceived imbalance in the value of each vote. A 38yearold Japanese man suggested equalizing the value of votes from young people versus those of the elderly. Young people should be entitled to two votes. This issue was also brought up in Spain The best thing would be one person one vote. That is that all votes were worth the same that they were not counted by autonomous communities said one man. The Electoral College the process by which U.S. presidential elections are decided is a major focus of electoral reform for many Americans. One man s response summarized this stance Abolition of the Electoral College to allow for direct representation of individual voters rather than allowing certain states to be overrepresented compared to their population size.  Most of the U.S. respondents who mention the Electoral College are against the process like one woman who said We need to do away with the Electoral College. It was a good idea but now it doesn t make sense. For many it s an issue of unequal representation The Electoral College should go away and potentially change how senators are allotted. Sparsely populated areas have too much influence while tens of millions of city residents essentially have no say said another woman.  Have transparent voting and respect who wins. And the one who loses should help the one who won and move on.  People also call for more election integrity. For example some feel there should be more transparency More openness in general election no corruption collusion or nepotism said a woman in Indonesia. Or as a Nigerian man put it Let us have a free and fair election with transparency. People are concerned about this issue in advanced economies as well with one Canadian man saying Election integrity needs to be improved and no outside interference.  Others emphasize the importance of respecting election results. Accept when a candidate loses the election and when a candidate is elected said a man in Brazil. An Israeli man put it simply Respect the results of the elections.   Monitor the processes more so that there is no miscount.  Improving electoral monitoring or the use of unbiased observers to ensure that elections are free and fair is also a key change people want Supervision over the counting of votes as a woman in Israel said. In Mexico where President Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador has sought controversial election reforms that many believe will weaken the country s National Electoral Institute INE there are specific calls to strengthen the INE instead of wanting to destroy it as one man said. A Nigerian man expressed his wish for a better institutional oversight saying The electoral commission should be independent and free from interference from the ruling party. Nigeria s electoral commission faced criticism during the February 2023 presidential election and was accused of delaying election results.  Consult the French people more often through referendums about important issues lifechanging issues.  For some a form of government where the public votes directly on proposed legislation or policies is a solution to fixing democracy. This sentiment is particularly common in European countries In France Germany Greece and the Netherlands it appears in the top five topics mentioned. In a handful of countries Australia Canada France Greece the Netherlands and the UK those who do not support the governing party or coalition are more likely to mention direct democracy. In France direct democracy is the secondmost mentioned change people want to see. French people on the ideological left are more likely to bring up this topic than those on the right. Additionally French adults who believe most elected officials don t care what people like them think as asked in a separate question are twice as likely to mention direct democracy as those who say most officials care what they think. Some in France specifically reference Article 49.3 of the French Constitution under which the government can push legislation through the National Assembly with no legislative vote Article 49.3 which had been established for certain situations is being used to force through unpopular measures said one man. The survey was fielded in France between February and April a period during which Article 49.3 was used to implement controversial pension reforms. Another French man criticizing Article 49.3 saw direct democracy as a clear solution saying Take into account the opinion of citizens in the form of a referendum. Ask for the citizens opinions to avoid passing laws in the form of 49.3.  Switzerland s political system in which the public is able to vote directly on constitutional initiatives and policy referenda is perceived positively by others around the world many of whom want their own country to emulate this model. For example one Canadian woman said If people could vote on important issues like in Switzerland and make decisions on important laws that s a true democracy there.   More public participation on single important topics just like the referendums in Switzerland.  This viewpoint is particularly widespread across European respondents many want their country s democracy to resemble Switzerland s. It would be a good idea to go back and make decisions much more collegially like the Swiss system said a French man. And a Swedish woman said More referenda on nuclear power sexuality NATO and the EU. Like Switzerland which has referendums on many issues. The survey was conducted prior to Sweden joining NATO in March 2024. Respondents in many countries highlight the benefits of more referenda or instances where the public votes directly on an issue. For some a key factor is the frequency of voting. One Kenyan man responded Citizens should have a referendum at least once in a while to decide on major issues that affect the country. And a German woman asked that more referendums take place.   More citizen participation in real decisionmaking. In other countries referendums are held expressing opinions on different issues not like here where they vote every four years.  In other cases referenda are seen as opportunities for the government to seek the public s approval. A Mexican man explained Before becoming legal reforms should pass through a citizen filter and popular consultation. This sometimes includes ensuring that more marginalized voices get a chance to weigh in. For example one Israeli man said When enacting any law there should be a referendum where all citizens vote whether Arabs or Jews. And an Australian woman wished to see more perspectives reflected calling for more direct democracy and more opportunities for influence by poor multicultural and minority groups.  In the UK where a controversial June 2016 referendum resulted in the UK departing the European Union known as Brexit some still express support for direct democracy. A British woman suggested We need to put down more questions more polls for the public to choose new policies new laws. One British man even noted that a referendum could undo Brexit We should have a referendum that is truly reflective about Brexit and rejoining the EU. But other Britons are more wary of direct democracy One man said We should not allow the general public to make critical decisions. The general public should not be allowed to make economic decisions for example Brexit.  Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers

There are only two serious contenders for president. And sure this is often the case in countries like Canada or Britain. But those countries have a lot more parties in their Congressparliament unlike America.   I ve heard a lot of people throw out solutions. Letting the peoplecitizens control voting ballots instead of the states like it once was proportional representation ranked choice voting or really most other ways besides first past the post.   Then of course there is the eternal question of the electoral college. I think most people are pretty angry at it by now especially after the 2016 election. But I m not sure what replacements people would prefer. Something like Canada where the biggest party in congress would pick the president? Or just straight up direct democracy even if people like me see it as having serious flaws?   What do you think? Do you think we need changes in the US voting system? If so how and why? 
https://news.uchicago.edu/story/does-electoral-college-need-be-reformed, Covering a story? Visit our page for journalists or call 773 7028360.  By Max Witynski   Nov 2 2020  The outcome of every U.S. presidential election hinges on a few key swing states whose electoral votes are awarded in a winnertakeall system. Often that tips the balance toward one candidate regardless of how that person performed in the popular vote. But does choosing a head of state in this manner actually reflect the will of the people? Ensuring that every vote receives an appropriate amount of weight is complicated according to University of Chicago political scientist James Lindley Wilson an expert on representation and democratic theory in the United States. In the following Q A Lindley Wilson an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science discusses some of the reforms that could make America more democratic. If three of the six most recent presidential elections were won by the loser of the popular vote I do think that would create a lot of momentum and opposition to the Electoral College over the long term especially if Democratic voters start to think about Electoral College reform as a higher priority issue. Change in the short term is harder to predict because it would require action by state legislatures at a minimum. If Democrats again win the popular vote but lose the election this year they probably will not have swept governorships and state legislatures so the status quo could persist. Yes. It s called the national popular vote movement and it s already been passed into law in many states totaling 196 electoral votes the states include big ones like California and New York and small ones like Vermont and Hawaii. Typically the laws are structured such that each state agrees to assign its presidential electors to the winner of the national popular vote but only if enough other states also agree to do so that it creates an Electoral College majority. This ensures that states don t water down their own votes unless they will actually achieve a broader shift to a new system. There s been quite a lot of success so far. The states that have signed on add up to almost 200 electoral votes so only a few more big states would need to join to make this effective. Swing states don t necessarily need to join all that needs to happen is that enough states join to control 270 electoral votes. If that happens and the coalition survives litigation it would clear the path for a Constitutional amendment to move to a popular vote. In principle in an ideal democracy sometimes it might be okay to have slightly unequally weighted votes if that s a way of increasing the representation and authority of minorities that otherwise would be neglected by the political process. The Senate and the Electoral College deviate from one person one vote in order to protect small states who would otherwise be neglected. The problem is there s no real evidence that citizens in small states are being neglected in the first place from a political representation standpoint Those voters tend to be from groups that already have lots of power. So reforms in the spirit of true democracy would try to remedy that by identifying populations that were actually underrepresented and implementing mechanisms to amplify their voices and votes in a responsible way so that their representation in Congress was equal to that of other voters. The Senate is extremely difficult to change and not just because of partisanship. The Constitution is written so that a state s equal representation in the Senate cannot be changed without that state s consent. That s very unlikely of course because not only would there have to be bipartisan agreement but states like Alaska or Wyoming would have to say Yes we re willing to have less representation than we currently have.  There are also current proposals to reform the Senate by adding more states. That s an imperfect solution because it means there are still radical inequalities in voting power. The argument is that if those aggregate inequalities better match the partisan balance of the population that at least creates a closer approximation of the one person one vote ideal within the Senate. Several states including many western states like Arizona and Colorado have independent redistricting commissions that work well. Instead of the legislature itself directly drawing the districts it appoints people to a relatively nonpartisan commission. That commission might have three Republicans and three Democrats or unaffiliated members. That independent commission is empowered by the legislature and given some principles for what counts as a good district and usually it avoids the worst abuses of gerrymandering. Often though legislatures are reluctant to create these commissions. That s either because one party fears ceding power or because incumbents in the majority party benefit from the status quo. If the boundaries of their own districts change that could put their seats in jeopardy. It s also worth noting that until recently this wasn t an issue that voters found very important so it hasn t necessarily been a top priority for legislatures. I think that s starting to change. I think the United States is probably closer to a breakdown and failure of democracy than it has been for a long time perhaps since the Civil War. That said the United States has been authoritarian with respect to significant portions of its population throughout its history most notably African Americans. But for the first time this year we could see democratic backsliding on a large scale. I say that because we see it in all kinds of institutional domains the rule of law voter suppression the Supreme Court and the Senate. One hopes that this election can remedy that somewhat and pull us back from the brink but democracy is definitely at stake this year.

Americans have never fully embraced the Electoral College. And why should they? The system treats votes unequally giving them more or less weight based on where voters live. It encourages campaigns to focus their efforts on a handful of swing states and encourages presidential candidates to skew public policy to benefit them. And as it has five times the Electoral College can enable the candidate who loses the popular vote to win the presidency. In these consequential ways the Electoral College system undermines our core democratic values. In line with its mission to promote a fair and robust democracy the Brennan Center for Justice supports amending the Constitution to eliminate the Electoral College. We also support the National Popular Vote Compact an agreement among the states to award their electoral votes to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. The Brennan Center will continue to educate the public and policymakers in the effort to have every vote counted equally. The Electoral Count Reform Act addresses vulnerabilities exposed by the efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.

We promote solutions like automatic voter registration and early voting to make it easier for eligible Americans to register and to vote. The voting process should be simple convenient and fair for everyone. But millions of Americans never make it on the rolls or to the polls while hurdles like long lines limited voting times or malfunctioning voting equipment block many more. Communities of color lowincome communities students and seniors are especially vulnerable. That s why we support a range of proposals to expand access to registration and voting. We led the way in developing and promoting automatic voter registration AVR in which eligible voters are automatically registered when they have contact with government agencies unless they opt out. It s a reform that is already dramatically reshaping registration by making it much easier to get on the rolls. We also support other reforms Early voting including on the weekend and evenings so that those who can t make it to the polls on election day aren t shut out sameday registration which lets people register and vote in one trip so arbitrary registration deadlines don t trip people up and online registration so that getting on the rolls and updating registration information is as convenient as possible and protections to ensure that eligible voters are not purged from the rolls. We also recommend that states take major steps to ensure that all polling places have sufficient voting machines and poll workers to reduce wait times. This means allocating appropriate funding for all communities. And we re proud to be part of the fight to restore the Voting Rights Act to full strength after it was badly weakened by the Supreme Court so that communities of color are protected from the ongoing scourge of racial discrimination in voting. Congress should pass the Automatic Voter Registration Act and states should continue to adopt automatic voter registration. Congress should restore the full protections of the Voting Rights Act and states should supplement those protections. Congress should set minimum early voting requirements in federal elections and the states that don t offer early voting should adopt it. Congress and the states should set and enforce standards to ensure all polling places have sufficient voting machines poll workers and other resources to avoid long lines.

The bill would bolster our democracy by protecting voting rights ending partisan gerrymandering improving campaign finance and safeguarding the electoral process. Outdated voter registration systems contribute to the United States low participation rates. Automatic voter registration could put every eligible voter on the rolls and give more Americans a voice. Congress must pass the John R. Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to strengthen this essential law and restore its core protections. Sound design principles along with better processes for creating and testing ballots can prevent lost or erroneous votes. Too few voting machines understaffed polls poor ballot design and other administrative election problems result in millions of lost votes especially in communities of color. The Brennan Center works for solutions to eliminate long lines at the polls and other voting hassles. The Brennan Center tracks voting legislation around the country keeping an eye on measures that restrict or expand voting access improve security or undermine election integrity. State legislatures have passed a nearrecord number of new restrictive voting laws so far this year while a prodemocracy movement presses on.  Analysis The Good News About Democracy in 2023 While serious threats to democracy remain there is also a growing prodemocracy movement pushing many states in the right direction.  Analysis Freedom to Vote in Jeopardy Especially for People of Color Many politicians continue to try to weaken our electoral systems and implement antivoting policies prompting Congress to reintroduce legislation setting national standards.  Making democracy work for everyone. Voter suppression. Gerrymandering. Big money in politics. Democracy is under attack. This year the House of Representatives approved the For the People Act which includes innovative solutions the Brennan Center developed on voting ethics campaign finance and fair election maps.

https://www.brookings.edu/articles/its-time-to-abolish-the-electoral-college/, For years when I taught campaigns and elections at Brown University I defended the Electoral College as an important part of American democracy. I said the founders created the institution to make sure that large states did not dominate small ones in presidential elections that power between Congress and state legislatures was balanced and that there would be checks and balances in the constitutional system. In recent years though I have changed my view and concluded it is time to get rid of the Electoral College. In this paper I explain the history of the Electoral College why it no longer is a constructive force in American politics and why it is time to move to the direct popular election of presidents. Several developments have led me to alter my opinion on this institution income inequality geographic disparities and how discrepancies between the popular vote and Electoral College are likely to become more commonplace given economic and geographic inequities. The remainder of this essay outlines why it is crucial to abolish the Electoral College. The framers of the Constitution set up the Electoral College for a number of different reasons. According to Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper Number 68 the body was a compromise at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia between large and small states. Many of the latter worried that states such as Massachusetts New York Pennsylvania and Virginia would dominate the presidency so they devised an institution where each state had Electoral College votes in proportion to the number of its senators and House members. The former advantaged small states since each state had two senators regardless of its size while the latter aided large states because the number of House members was based on the state s population. In addition there was considerable discussion regarding whether Congress or state legislatures should choose the chief executive. Those wanting a stronger national government tended to favor Congress while states rights adherents preferred state legislatures. In the end there was a compromise establishing an independent group chosen by the states with the power to choose the president. But delegates also had an antimajoritarian concern in mind. At a time when many people were not welleducated they wanted a body of wise men women lacked the franchise who would deliberate over leading contenders and choose the best man for the presidency. They explicitly rejected a popular vote for president because they did not trust voters to make a wise choice. In most elections the Electoral College has operated smoothly. State voters have cast their ballots and the presidential candidate with the most votes in a particular state has received all the Electoral College votes of that state except for Maine and Nebraska which allocate votes at the congressional district level within their states. But there have been several contested elections. The 1800 election deadlocked because presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson received the same number of Electoral College votes as his vice presidential candidate Aaron Burr. At that time the ballot did not distinguish between Electoral College votes for president and vice president. On the 36th ballot the House chose Jefferson as the new president. Congress later amended the Constitution to prevent that ballot confusion from happening again. Just over two decades later Congress had an opportunity to test the newly established 12th Amendment. All four 1824 presidential aspirants belonged to the same party the DemocraticRepublicans and although each had local and regional popularity none of them attained the majority of their party s Electoral College votes. Andrew Jackson came the closest with 99 Electoral College votes followed by John Quincy Adams with 84 votes William Crawford with 41 and Henry Clay with 37. Because no candidate received the necessary 131 votes to attain the Electoral College majority the election was thrown into the House of Representatives. As dictated by the 12th Amendment each state delegation cast one vote among the top three candidates. Since Clay no longer was in the running he made a deal with Adams to become his secretary of state in return for encouraging congressional support for Adams candidacy. Even though Jackson had received the largest number of popular votes he lost the presidency through what he called a corrupt bargain between Clay and Adams. America was still recovering from the Civil War when Republican Rutherford Hayes ran against Democrat Samuel Tilden in the 1876 presidential election. The race was so close that the electoral votes of just four states would determine the presidency. On Election Day Tilden picked up the popular vote plurality and 184 electoral votes but fell one vote short of an Electoral College majority. However Hayes claimed that his party would have won Florida Louisiana and South Carolina if not for voter intimidation against African American voters and in Oregon one of Hayes three electoral votes was in dispute. Instead of allowing the House to decide the presidential winner as prescribed by the 12th Amendment Congress passed a new law to create a bipartisan Electoral Commission. Through this commission five members each from the House Senate and Supreme Court would assign the 20 contested electoral votes from Louisiana Florida South Carolina and Oregon to either Hayes or Tilden. Hayes became president when this Electoral Commission ultimately gave the votes of the four contested states to him. The decision would have farreaching consequences because in return for securing the votes of the Southern states Hayes agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South thereby paving the way for vigilante violence against African Americans and the denial of their civil rights. Allegations of election unfairness also clouded the 2000 race. The contest between Republican George Bush and Democrat Al Gore was extremely close ultimately resting on the fate of Florida s 25 electoral votes. Ballot controversies in Palm Beach County complicated vote tabulation. It used the butterfly ballot design which some decried as visually confusing. Additionally other Florida counties that required voters to punch perforated paper ballots had difficulty discerning the voters choices if they did not fully detach the appropriate section of the perforated paper. Accordingly on December 8 2000 the Florida Supreme Court ordered manual recounts in counties that reported statistically significant numbers of undervotes. The Bush campaign immediately filed suit and in response the U.S. Supreme Court paused manual recounts to hear oral arguments from candidates. On December 10 in a landmark 72 decision the Supreme Court struck down the Florida Supreme Court s recount decision ruling that a manual recount would violate the 14th Amendment s Equal Protection Clause. Bush won Florida s Electoral College votes and thus the presidency even though Gore had won the popular vote by almost half a million votes. The latest controversy arose when Donald Trump lost the popular vote by almost three million ballots yet won the Electoral College by 74 votes. That made him the fifth U.S. chief executive to become president without winning the popular vote. This discrepancy between the Electoral College and the popular vote created considerable contentiousness about the electoral system. It set the Trump presidency off on a rough start and generated a critical tone regarding his administration. In addition to the problems noted above the Electoral College suffers from another difficulty known as the faithless elector issue in which that body s electors cast their ballot in opposition to the dictates of their state s popular vote. Samuel Miles a Federalist from Pennsylvania was the first of this genre as for unknown reasons he cast his vote in 1796 for the DemocraticRepublican candidate Thomas Jefferson even though his own Federalist party candidate John Adams had won Pennsylvania s popular vote. Miles turned out to be the first of many. Throughout American history 157 electors have voted contrary to their state s chosen winner. Some of these individuals dissented for idiosyncratic reasons but others did so because they preferred the losing party s candidate. The precedent set by these people creates uncertainty about how future Electoral College votes could proceed. This possibility became even more likely after a recent court decision. In the 2016 election seven electors defected from the dictates of their state s popular vote. This was the highest number in any modern election. A Colorado lawsuit challenged the legality of state requirements that electors follow the vote of their states something which is on the books in 29 states plus the District of Columbia. In the Baca v. Hickenlooper case a federal court ruled that states cannot penalize faithless electors no matter the intent of the elector or the outcome of the state vote. Bret Chiafalo and plaintiff Michael Baca were state electors who began the selfnamed Hamilton Electors movement in which they announced their desire to stop Trump from winning the presidency. Deriving their name from Founding Father Alexander Hamilton they convinced a few members of the Electoral College to cast their votes for other Republican candidates such as John Kasich or Mitt Romney. When Colorado decided to nullify Baca s vote he sued. A threejudge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that Colorado s decision to remove Baca s vote was unconstitutional since the founders were explicit about the constitutional rights of electors to vote independently. Based on this legal ruling and in a highly polarized political environment where people have strong feelings about various candidates it is possible that future faithless electors could tip the presidency one way or another thereby nullifying the popular vote. The problems outlined above illustrate the serious issues facing the Electoral College. Having a president who loses the popular vote undermines electoral legitimacy. Putting an election into the House of Representatives where each state delegation has one vote increases the odds of insider dealings and corrupt decisions. Allegations of balloting irregularities that require an Electoral Commission to decide the votes of contested states do not make the general public feel very confident about the integrity of the process. And faithless electors could render the popular vote moot in particular states. Yet there is a far more fundamental threat facing the Electoral College. At a time of high income inequality and substantial geographical disparities across states there is a risk that the Electoral College will systematically overrepresent the views of relatively small numbers of people due to the structure of the Electoral College. As currently constituted each state has two Electoral College votes regardless of population size plus additional votes to match its number of House members. That format overrepresents small and mediumsized states at the expense of large states. That formula is problematic at a time when a Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program study found that 15 percent of American counties generate 64 percent of America s gross domestic product. Most of the country s economic activity is on the East Coast West Coast and a few metropolitan areas in between. The prosperous parts of America include about 15 states having 30 senators while the less prosperous areas encapsulate 35 states having 70 senators. Those numbers demonstrate the fundamental mismatch between economic vitality and political power. Through the Electoral College and the U.S. Senate the 35 states with smaller economic activity have disproportionate power to choose presidents and dictate public policy. This institutional relic from two centuries ago likely will fuel continued populism and regular discrepancies between the popular and Electoral College votes. Rather than being a historic aberration presidents who lose the popular vote could become the norm and thereby usher in an antimajoritarian era where small numbers of voters in a few states use their institutional clout in leftbehind states to block legislation desired by large numbers of people. For years a majority of Americans have opposed the Electoral College. For example in 1967 58 percent favored its abolition while in 1981 75 percent of Americans did so. More recent polling however has highlighted a dangerous development in public opinion. Americans by and large still want to do away with the Electoral College but there now is a partisan divide in views with Republicans favoring it while Democrats oppose it. For instance POLITICO and Morning Consult conducted a poll in March 2019 that found that 50 percent of respondents wanted a direct popular vote 34 percent did not and 16 percent did not demonstrate a preference. Two months later NBC News and the Wall Street Journal reported polling that 53 percent of Americans wanted a direct popular vote while 43 percent wanted to keep the status quo. These sentiments undoubtably have been reinforced by the fact that in two of the last five presidential elections the candidate winning the popular vote lost the Electoral College. Yet there are clear partisan divisions in these sentiments. In 2000 while the presidential election outcome was still being litigated a Gallup survey reported that 73 percent of Democratic respondents supported a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College and move to direct popular voting but only 46 percent of Republican respondents supported that view. This gap has since widened as after the 2016 election 81 percent of Democrats and 19 percent of Republicans affirmatively answered the same question. The March POLITICO and Morning Consult poll also found that 72 percent of Democratic respondents and 30 percent of Republican respondents endorsed a direct popular vote. Likewise the NBC News and Wall Street Journal poll found that 78 percent of Hillary Clinton voters supported a national popular vote while 74 percent of Trump voters preferred the Electoral College. The U.S. Constitution created the Electoral College but did not spell out how the votes get awarded to presidential candidates. That vagueness has allowed some states such as Maine and Nebraska to reject winnertakeall at the state level and instead allocate votes at the congressional district level. However the Constitution s lack of specificity also presents the opportunity that states could allocate their Electoral College votes through some other means. One such mechanism that a number of states already support is an interstate pact that honors the national popular vote. Since 2008 15 states and the District of Columbia have passed laws to adopt the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact NPVIC which is an multistate agreement to commit electors to vote for candidates who win the nationwide popular vote even if that candidate loses the popular vote within their state. The NPVIC would become effective only if states ratify it to reach an electoral majority of 270 votes. Right now the NPVIC is well short of that goal and would require an additional 74 electoral votes to take effect. It also faces some particular challenges. First it is unclear how voters would respond if their state electors collectively vote against the popular vote of their state. Second there are no binding legal repercussions if a state elector decides to defect from the national popular vote. Third given the Tenth Circuit decision in the Baca v. Hickenlooper case described above the NPVIC is almost certain to face constitutional challenges should it ever gain enough electoral votes to go into effect. A more permanent solution would be to amend the Constitution itself. That is a laborious process and a constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College would require significant consensus at least twothirds affirmation from both the House and Senate and approval from at least 38 out of 50 states. But Congress has nearly reached this threshold in the past. Congress nearly eradicated the Electoral College in 1934 falling just two Senate votes short of passage. However the conversation did not end after the unsuccessful vote legislators have continued to debate ending or reforming the Electoral College since. In 1979 another Senate vote to establish a direct popular vote failed this time by just three votes. Nonetheless conversation continued the 95th Congress proposed a total of 41 relevant amendments in 1977 and 1978 and the 116th Congress has already introduced three amendments to end the Electoral College. In total over the last two centuries there have been over 700 proposals to either eradicate or seriously modify the Electoral College. It is time to move ahead with abolishing the Electoral College before its clear failures undermine public confidence in American democracy distort the popular will and create a genuine constitutional crisis.
