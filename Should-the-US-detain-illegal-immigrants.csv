The Department of Homeland Security DHS manages the largest immigration detention system in the world and spends more on immigration enforcement than on all other federal enforcement agencies combined. On the southern border Customs and Border Protection CBP agents are poorly trained to respond to the humanitarian crisis produced by rampant violence throughout Central America resulting in the return of many bona fide refugees to harm and the placement of many asylum seekers in summary removal processes that lack basic due process protections. Enforcement operations in the interior of the country undertaken by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE rely on cooperation with state and local law enforcement agencies creating fertile ground for racial profiling and mistrust of local police among immigrant communities. ICE issues documents known as detainers to request such cooperation frequently violating federal immigration law and constitutional protections when doing so. Men women and children apprehended by CBP or ICE are normally placed in removal proceedings and may be detained in one of the more than 200 jails and detention centers that make up ICE s detention system. Many of the immigrants detained in ICE s nominally civil system are held in county and local jails that contract with ICE to detain immigrants. The rest are held in dedicated immigration detention facilities run by ICE or contracted to private prison corporations including family detention centers that hold mothers and children. ICE s detention system is built and operated on a correctional model in direct conflict with the civil nature of immigration detention. ICE routinely fails to provide adequate oversight and exercise meaningful consequences for facility failures to meet ICE s minimal detention standards. Meanwhile ICE has failed to invest in far more humane effective and costefficient communitybased alternatives to detention that could reduce the government s immigration detention spending by 80 percent.

https://www.aila.org/library/featured-issue-immigration-detention, AILA calls on Congress to significantly reduce and phase out the use of immigration detention for immigration enforcement purposes. Detention is costly leads to inefficiencies in processing cases and has a long track record of human rights abuses. Communitybased case management services and legal representation is more humane and should be offered to noncitizens to support their compliance of immigration obligations.  Created in 2003 Immigration Customs Enforcement ICE has over 22000 fulltime employees with a total annual budget of more than 8 billion. The agency has three core operational directorates Enforcement and Removal Operations ERO Homeland Security Investigations HSI and the Office of the Principal Legal Advisor OPLA. Housed within the Department of Homeland Security ICE joins Customs Border Protection CBP in making up the nation s largest police force. Immigration enforcement including taking noncitizens into custody is the largest single area of responsibility for ICE. ICE detains noncitizens arrested from the interior of the country and those transferred from the border. Twentyyears ago the average daily population of detained immigrants was approximately 7000. During the Trump Administration it reached a height of 50000 average daily population. Regardless of the circumstances of their first encounter with authorities noncitizens are detained across America in a sprawling network of private and public detention facilities. Most of these facilities operate through contracts between ICE or less commonly the U.S. Marshals Service and localities for the purposes of detaining noncitizens. In some cases localities later subcontract services for operating detention facilities to private prison companies. In other instances localities reserve space in local county or state jails and prisons for the purposes of detaining immigrants. In all cases localities are financially incentivized to detain individuals to increase profit margins from contracts. One key part of the financial equation is the use of noncitizens to clean and maintain facilities in exchange for 1 a day.Immigration detention facilities regardless of the type of contracts have been the sites of serious and repeated allegations of abuse including allegations of sexual assault violations of religious freedom medical neglect and the punitive use of solitary confinement. In 2020 the U.S. had the highest number of deaths in ICE adult detention since 2005. Several deaths in custody have been found to have been preventable. Conditions in ICE custody have been described as barbaric and negligent by DHS experts.Civil immigration detention works mainly to facilitate deportation. While ICE has the authority to allow most noncitizens to continue with their removal cases on the nondetained docket it often defaults to detention based on alleged flight risk or threat to public safety. The vagueness of these concepts frequently works against the liberty interests of noncitizens and there is generally a lack of uniformity when it comes to these discretionary releases. Only a small portion of individuals must be detained under mandatory detention laws and even those individuals may be released based on certain exceptions. Typically people in detention are being processed via expedited removal regular immigration proceedings or reinstatement proceedings reinstatement of prior removal order. Lastly because immigration detention is considered civil indigent noncitizens are not generally provided counsel. As a result representation rates for noncitizens in detention are as low as 14 and directly correlate with the ability to secure release or longterm protection. Detention is overused and too often implemented as part of punitive policies to deter immigration and against noncitizens who are not a flight risk or a threat to public safety including people seeking protection in this country. For all these reasons and more AILA is calling for the dramatic reduction and eventual phasing out of immigration detention. 1331 G Street NW Suite 300Washington DC 20005  Phone 2025077600 Fax 2027837853  Copyright 1993document.writenew Date.getFullYearAmerican Immigration Lawyers AssociationPrivacy policyCopyright policy
https://immigrantjustice.org/research-items/policy-brief-5-reasons-end-immigrant-detention, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE holds tens of thousands of people daily in the equivalent of pretrial detention without appointed counsel and often without access to bond hearings. ICE uses taxpayer dollars to jail and deport people who have lived in the United States for decades including parents of U.S. citizens and people who arrived recently seeking safety or a better life. They are held in one of more than 200 prisons jails and prisonlike complexes rife with systemic racism and abuse. These facilities are largely operated by private companies and are remote and isolated.  While I was detained my wife gave birth to our second child and our family lost our home. I met our new baby in a picture by mail. I saw a man who was detained with me hang himself to try to commit suicide. I feel traumatized still today from all that I saw.  Johannes Favia father detained by ICE for nearly a yearwhile awaiting his green card The U.S. immigrant detention system began to grow into its current form only a few decades ago. It has evolved into a behemoth that makes communities less safe not more. The federal government should not abuse or mistreat people or deprive them of their liberty solely because they are facing civil immigration proceedings. It should not further punitive systems of incarceration and enforcement that perpetuate racism against Black and Brown immigrants. Rather the government should permit people to pursue their cases from the safety of their homes and communities with case management available when needed.  NIJC calls on policy makers and elected officials to take immediate and dramatic steps toward ending immigrant detention. Here are five reasons why based on NIJC s new independent analysis of ICE data.  The immigrant detention system as we know it today constitutes a relatively new experiment in American history. Although current political rhetoric has normalized the detention of immigrants as part of the United States social and political landscape it hasn t always been this way.  In the late 1800s immigrants arriving to the United States were held briefly on Ellis Island and Angel Island for medical checks and then released. When Ellis Island closed in 1954 the U.S. government formally abandoned the policy of immigrant detention relying instead on conditional parole bonds or supervision. ThenAttorney General Herbert Brownell Jr. described this policy shift as a step forward toward humane administration of the immigration laws.  The presumption of liberty for immigrants remained in place for most of the second half of the 20th century. Then in the 1980s the U.S. government turned to mass detention to respond to the flight of thousands of Haitian refugees escaping the brutal Duvalier regime with the explicit goal of deterring Haitians from seeking asylum in the United States. The immigration incarceration system grew around the targeting of Black Haitian immigrants and Cubans escaping by boat from the port of Mariel. During the same time period the Reagan administration s tough on crime policies doubled the prison population as communities of color were increasingly overpoliced and criminalized.  Over the course of the 1990s the same policies and political rhetoric that resulted in the mass incarceration of Black and Brown communities in U.S. jails and prisons fueled the expansion of immigrant detention into the system we see today. In just fiscal year 2020 ICE used more than 3 billion in taxpayer dollars to fund the detention of nearly 170000 immigrants detaining each person for an average of three months and in many cases much longer. A cleareyed evidencebased assessment reveals that immigrant detention undermines public safety. Immigration enforcement actions destabilize communities. Detentions and deportations create financial and housing insecurity for families and lead to a general sense of fearfulness and lack of trust in public institutions. This fear triggers harmful consequences as communities become afraid to send their children to school attend religious gatherings and access emergency medical care. Detentions and deportations do not make communities safer they rip security away.  Immigration court proceedings are civil in nature the sole purpose of detention is to ensure that people appear at their court hearings and comply with immigration judges orders. The government is detaining people while they pursue asylum claims after arriving in the United States or because of alleged violations of a visa or other lawful status in the United States. No one in ICE custody is serving time for a conviction or facing a criminal charge. On the contrary the detention system despite now being characterized by barbed wire and massive prison complexes was never meant to play a role in public safety and legally is prohibited from being punitive.  The graph to the right shows the average daily population ADP in detention in FY 2020 based on ICE s own categorization of threat level. According to the government more than half of people detained by ICE presented no threat. Only 17.6 percent were considered by ICE s own matrix to fall within the most serious threat classification. People in immigrant detention who do have past criminal convictions even serious ones have either already served out a sentence ordered by a criminal court judge or will do so once they are released from ICE custody. There is no justification for imposing a second penalty on immigrants convicted of crimes solely because of their places of birth. Study after study shows that immigrants bring a vibrancy and interconnectedness that correlates to lower crime rates even in disadvantaged communities. This protective influence has been shown to be enhanced in localities that adopt a welcoming rather than punitive approach to immigrants. The evidence is clear policies of immigration control that promote detention and deportation make our communities less safe policies of welcoming and inclusion enhance the public good. There is a better way. Immigrants should be permitted to live in the safety of their homes and communities while navigating their court proceedings. Approximately 90 of asylum seekers arriving at the southern border have a loved one with whom they can stay in the United States. Immigrants facing court proceedings due to interior enforcement operations are established community residents many of whom have jobs that have been deemed essential during the coronavirus pandemic and whose earnings help support families and children.  For immigrants and asylum seekers who do need social services or case support many communitysupported case management programs are available though currently underfunded. Evidencebased studies consistently show that communitybased programs are up to 80 less expensive than detention and that 90 of participants comply with obligations imposed by courts or agencies. Most importantly communitybased alternatives along the border and throughout the United States offer a framework for migration processing that keeps families together and makes all our communities safer.  There are many examples of successful communitybased programs. For instance nonprofit organizations in California provide a range of support services to immigrants released from detention including support with transportation and housing financial assistance and inkind donations such as food clothing and phones. These organizations also offer case management to provide support accessing legal social medical and mental health services. Studies show that when human needs and dignity are addressed holistically case management programs are remarkably consistent in supporting high compliance rates and successful outcomes. Many communities have already developed smart models for a better and more humane way to support immigrants during case processing. The billions of tax dollars that are currently funding the immigrant detention system can be better invested in communities willing and able to provide an alternative approach.  Years of ICE corruption and impunity have resulted in a system that delivers death and harm to countless immigrants. For those who endure the pain of ICE s immigrant detention system the scars are lifelong. This system cannot be fixed it must be dismantled.  Getting caught in the immigrant detention dragnet means exposure to immeasurable harm and potentially death. The number of people who have died in ICE custody in 2020 is more than double the prior year even as the number of those jailed has decreased because of Trumpera policies that largely seal off the southern border to asylum seekers. Sexual assault violent abuse medical neglect and unsanitary conditions are commonplace in ICE jails. An opaque web of intentionally corrupted contracts and inspections breed impunity for ICE and its contractors. Independent medical experts have repeatedly found that approximately half of all deaths in ICE custody are attributable to medical negligence. Yet in the very same facilities where multiple deaths have occurred egregious lapses in medical care and unconscionable delays in treatment persist. Immigrant detention centers reinforce systemic racism in our society disproportionately causing harm to Black and Brown immigrants. Because the criminal legal system serves as a pipeline to immigrant detention the structural racism fueling mass incarceration of Black and Brown communities is imported into the immigration system. Black immigrants are disproportionately detained by ICE as a second punishment after involvement in the criminal legal system. Immigration enforcement tactics are gendered and racialized disproportionately targeting Black and Latino men. The Trump administration has chosen to implement blanket detention policies that continue to jail immigrants with particular vulnerabilities such as pregnant women and the elderly. ICE has adopted a policy of automatic and prolonged detention of asylum seekers. Additionally the Trump administration has doubled down on the practice of jailing immigrant families in prisonlike facilities referred to euphemistically as family residential centers. This practice has been condemned by the American Academy of Pediatrics which warns that even short periods of detention can cause psychological trauma and longterm mental health risks for children.  The COVID19 pandemic has brought into sharp relief ICE s callous disregard for the lives of those it detains and the public health of surrounding communities. ICE has refused to provide immigrants in custody with the basic equipment they need to protect themselves from the virus such as masks and hand sanitizer. Throughout the pandemic ICE has recklessly and unnecessarily transferred people between facilities creating new outbreaks inside jails and in surrounding communities. In the town of Natchez Mississippi an outbreak in the local immigrant detention center caused a 200 increase in the town s COVID19 case load in one week. Detained immigrants who protest ICE s cruel response are met with pepper spray. If ICE detention is not the result of smart and effective policy making then what accounts for the quick growth and massive expansion of the system? Corporate profits. The U.S. immigrant detention system operates under a patchwork of contracts. More than 90 of immigrants detained by ICE are held in county or local jails contracting with ICE or in large prison complexes owned andor operated by private prison companies. Private prison companies have been central and causal to the growth of the immigrant detention system. In fact CoreCivic and GEO Group the two largest private prison companies depend on federal contracts for 48 of their revenue. ICE contracts alone account for nearly onethird of both companies profits. CoreCivic and GEO Group have spoken openly with their shareholders about the importance of their government contracts to their bottom line warning that policies that could reduce the government s reliance on detention threaten their business model. Smaller companies such as Immigration Centers of America also rake in millions every month to detain people while employing lobbyists to pursue new and expanded ICE contracts. Private profit should never drive public policy making particularly when that profit motive is proven to result in cutting corners that put lives at risk. The U.S. immigrant detention system undermines community safety leaves death and tragedy in its wake and costs billions of dollars. The time to end immigrant detention is now.

https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/alternatives-immigration-detention-overview, Download PDF with Citations The United States has broad authority to detain certain categories of migrants and others seeking humanitarian protection as their proceedings wind their way through the immigration legal system. This detention is civil by definition as opposed to criminal meaning that it should not be punitive in nature. Despite this technical legal distinction most immigration detention infrastructure is indistinguishable from the criminal detention context in some instances using the same facilities and private corporations to operate detention centers and jails.  Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE states that the purpose of immigration detention is twofold 1 to protect the wider community from those noncitizens who may pose a safety risk and 2 to ensure that the individual will comply with any immigration proceedings including removal. For the last two decades there has been increasing interest in the United States and abroad to create and expand alternatives to detention for noncitizens who would otherwise be sent to immigration detention centers. This is due to an increasing understanding that detention is fundamentally harmful and inhumane especially to immigrants of color that there are alternatives that can achieve similar objectives to those the government is pursuing and that there has been very little meaningful reform of immigration detention itself. For example the current standards that govern the conditions of most immigrant detention centers the PerformanceBased National Detention Standards were explicitly based on criminal pretrial detention and were written in 2011 with minor updates made in 2016 and no updates in the years since then. Study after study has shown that alternatives to detention programs are generally more humane and more costeffective than immigration detention. Alternatives to detention ATDs are defined as any legislation policy or practice formal or informal that ensures people are not detained for reasons relating to their migration status.  Alternatives to detention can refer to a wide range of programs that run the gamut from no governmental intervention to extensive surveillance and restrictions on liberties. Generally alternatives to detention in the immigration context fall into the following categories While many countries utilize some or all of these tools the United States government has a fairly narrow definition of alternatives to detention and has been increasingly focused on programs that expand surveillance and restrictions on movement of noncitizens as opposed to using alternatives as a means of reducing the overall use of detention. The United States has by and large adopted a detention first policy towards individuals who may be inadmissible or removable often detaining people first and then providing mechanisms for a detained migrant to request release from detention. In 2004 ICE piloted an early alternative to detention program. This was an introduction to the now ubiquitous Intensive Supervision Appearance Program ISAP. ISAP began as a program in eight cities with a select number of people assigned to case specialists and involved a variety of ways for ICE to track the location of the participant including electronic ankle monitors inperson checkins and home visits. ISAP was from the beginning a program operated by BI Incorporated BI a whollyowned subsidiary of The GEO Group Inc. which is a large private prison company that specializes in operating private forprofit immigration detention centers. ISAP now in its fourth iteration ballooned to over 320000 people enrolled in 2022 according to ICE s data up from the 200 it began with in 2004. Today BI maintains the contract to operate ISAP IV even as criticism of the mismanagement of the program and mistreatment of immigrants in the program mounts. Number of ISAP participants between 2004 and Present  ICE s early alternatives to detention pilots used various forms of electronic monitoring. In addition to the publicprivate partnership with BI ICE ran its own ATD pilot at the same time. In 2004 it began the Electronic Monitoring Device program EMD which used a combination of telephonic checkins with voice recognition software and home curfews using radio frequency monitoring. In 2008 ICE decided to combine ISAP EMD and a third program into one alternativetodetention program which became ISAP II. This has been the basis for nearly all official alternativetodetention programming in the United States since then. Alternativetodetention policies embraced by the government have been limited almost exclusively pursuing programs whose primary goal is to make future enforcement and removal more expeditious and those that are primarily focused on ensuring compliance. These programs emphasize monitoring and surveillance coordination with ICE and consequences for noncompliance though there have been signs of an increasing willingness on the part of DHS to explore other options. Research shows that other aspects of a person s case like having legal representation have a greater impact on ensuring that nondetained individuals appear for court and otherwise comply with proceedings. Many advocates have argued that ATDs have not been used in the United States as true alternatives to detention. An increase in enrollment in ATDs over the last decade has not corresponded with a significant decrease in detention numbers. For example according to ICE the average daily number of people in ICE detention centers rose from 19254 in Fiscal Year FY 2021 to 22 578 at the end of FY 2022 while the number of people in ATD programs increased by over 186000 enrollees over that same period. Rather than serve as alternatives to detention these programs have at times served as alternatives to release without conditions. By adopting this framework the United States has both expanded immigration detention while simultaneously expanding government control over migrants and immigrant communities in the name of alternatives.  Alternatives to detention programs are primarily operated under the auspices of ICE. The budget for ATDs has steadily risen in the last five years going from 126 million to enroll 53000 individuals on ATDs in FY 2017 to 443 million in FY 2023. As of the date of publication ICE was monitoring 281613 people in its ATD programs. These programs currently come in three forms The Intensive Appearance Supervision Program ISAP Extended Case Management Services ECMS which operates as an addon to the ISAP program and inperson checkins. A fourth program the Case Management Pilot Program is anticipated to begin soon. While initially only enrolling 700 individuals this pilot program would take individuals out of ISAP and into a less restrictive means of ICE checkins while also providing muchneeded communitybased services.  Growth in Alternatives to Detention Program Budget Between 2017 and 2022  The current iteration of ISAP ISAP IV is reliant on electronic monitoring such as GPS tracking via an ankle monitor voice recognition or the use of a smartphone app and facial recognition. Of the 281613 individuals enrolled in ATDs as of March 25 2023 4874 were being monitored using ankle monitors 252185 were being monitored using the SmartLINK smartphone app 12522 were being monitored using telephonic checkins and 12032 were monitored in ways not involving technology. This marks a significant decrease in the use of ankle monitors down from over 28000 enrolled in FY 2022 a welcome improvement. In April 2023 ICE announced a new pilot program to test GPSenabled watches which rolled out in Denver Colorado.  The use of GPS ankle monitors has come under significant criticism in recent years. Some simply describe it as cyber prison. People placed in the ISAP program who are required to wear ankle monitors have described both physical and emotional harm caused by the devices. GPS ankle monitors severely restrict a person s freedom of movement. They limit where a person can go geographically and require a person to be able to charge the monitor regularly. People have also reported physical pain with the ankle monitors. These monitors often take an emotional toll as well with people who have fled harm or persecution sometimes perpetrated by governments finding themselves under intense government surveillance and feeling like they are essentially still imprisoned. In 2019 DHS incorporated some of the aspects of the Family Case Management Program a highly successful pilot program for a communitybased ATD as an addition to the thenactive ISAP III program. People enrolled in ECMS are given case managers hired by The GEO Group to help provide referrals and information to participants. However even though the program has now been in place for over a year very few people receive these services. Of 182607 people in ATDs as of March 2022 only 1238 are enrolled in ECMS.  The United States is not the only nation struggling with how to humanely treat migrants. Over the past few years a set of best practices for alternatives to detention has emerged internationally. These higherquality ATDs are ones which do not also increase the surveillance and monitoring of immigrants and are communitybased meaning they are operated in the community where participants reside by organizations or entities that are closely tied to the community and its resources. Additionally many include a case management model which generally involves providing a migrant with wraparound social and legal services intended to facilitate the client s ability to meaningfully participate in their immigration proceedings while having their needs met. Some of the other best practices include In 2020 Congress appropriated money for FY 2021 to create the Case Management Pilot Program CMPP . Unlike prior ATDs CMPP does not operate directly out of ICE and is instead a program managed by a board made up of nonprofit organizations with a history of providing services to immigrant populations as well as the DHS Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties CRCL . CMPP operates by funding nonprofit organizations or local governments to provide a wide range of services to individuals in removal proceedings. These services include case management legal orientation legal representation and social services such as counseling referrals for medical care etc. Individuals placed into CMPP are also still required to comply with their immigration obligations. While still in its infancy CMPP is an important step in the direction of creating alternatives to detention that provide services to people in removal proceedings and support their ability to comply with immigration courts and processes. Previous CommunityBased Programs The Family Case Management Program was a shortlived pilot program that ran from January 2016 to June 2017 when it was terminated by the Trump administration. It was the United States first governmentsupported attempt at a purely casemanagement model for an ATD. At a cost of 38 per person per day it was also significantly less expensive than detention. The FCMP was designed with significant input from nongovernmental organizations. However when it came to contracting for services DHS accepted the proposal from GEO Care a division of GEO Group that did not have case management experience in the immigration context and was closely tied to the private prison industry. Still the program is generally considered a success including by ICE with an over 99 percent compliance rate with ICE checkins and court appearances. The program served 952 heads of households and over 2000 total participants in five cities. Service provision included referrals to pro bono legal services referrals and navigation for access to housing referrals for medical services English language classes and assistance with obtaining identity documents. While the FCMP was terminated before most cases were completed it did provide a baseline for how a case management based ATD could function successfully. Advocates argue that FCMP could have been even more effective if it was operated by nonprofit organizations who have extensive experience with immigration case management and required less cooperation with ICE which made it more difficult for the program operators to develop trust with clients. In 2018 the Trump administration through its Zero Tolerance policy separated thousands of children from their parents. Due to a court order issued in June 2018 the government was forced to work to quickly reunify these children with their families. In order to do so they requested that two organizations who work extensively with refugee resettlement Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services LIRS and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops set up an emergency case management system for these families without funding. Local nonprofit legal service providers volunteered and provided basic information on the immigration process and other referrals. LIRS provided referrals for housing and medical care and assisted in document retrieval and transportation for families to get to their final destinations. LIRS reported that while the program was a success in terms of ensuring that families appeared for future court dates and checkins the cost without government support was unsustainable. Additionally providing simple referrals for legal service provision was not sufficient to ensure actual legal representation as legal service providers were also understaffed and lacking in resources. There are other examples of alternatives to detention programs run by nongovernmental nonprofit organizations dating back to the 1990s. Some further examples are Currently in Chicago there is a program that is much closer to the widely adopted principles for a true alternative to detention. Operated by the Interfaith Community for Detained Immigrants ICDI their Harbor Hospitality provides asylum seekers recently released from detention with case management local service connections legal service referrals and accompaniment and posttransition services. The program reports high levels of compliance.  While the United States has so far largely embraced policies that use alternatives to detention as alternatives to release without conditions and as means of increasing the overall capacity of the surveillance and restrictions on noncitizens there are numerous opportunities to expand the range of alternatives and embrace policies that are proven to be effective in supporting a noncitizen s navigation of the immigration legal system. Internationally networks of wraparound services developed and implemented by nongovernmental communitybased organizations with proven experience working with these communities can be found in many places. Programs that give noncitizens access to support for housing employment language instruction and legal representation have been demonstrably successful as humane effective alternatives to detention that can reduce overall numbers of people in detention. The Case Management Pilot Program is a significant step in moving away from purely surveillancebased programs. Hopefully it will demonstrate the success of such projects in meeting the same goals of other ATDs such as compliance with immigration enforcement and immigration court proceedings. There are also indications that ICE is aware of other options for how alternatives to detention could operate. In Garcia Ramirez v. ICE as part of the injunction ICE is required to try to find an alternative to detaining individuals when they turn 18 years old and age out of the government programs operated to house them. ICE is required to contact five shelters or group homes as alternatives to detention. Many of these shelters provide wraparound services. But it has been the emergence of a global pandemic that has revealed other possibilities for alternatives to detention. Several countries hoping to avoid confining people to close quarters while COVID19 was first spreading began to reduce the overall number of people being detained to begin with and released significant numbers of people from detention. In some places such as Spain this was accompanied by extraordinary work permits to allow for increased support in the labor sector. The need for additional accommodations for individuals released also led to extensions of housing accommodations. The state of emergency exposed the need for additional infrastructure for communitybased alternatives to detention but also demonstrated that with political will large numbers of people could be provided with the kind of services that are proven to support noncitizens through the immigration legal system. The United States can and should implement alternatives to detention that serve to reduce the overall detention population provide services that are known to increase compliance with immigration proceedings and reduce obstacles to compliance. These true alternatives to detention are more humane more costeffective and more in line with international standards. Separating these services from immigration enforcement and providing them in a casemanagement model operated by organizations with extensive experience is the path forward. The United States government has demonstrated a commitment to case management as a model. It now needs to heed the advice of nonprofit nongovernmental organizations on best practices for implementation. Get the latest from the American Immigration Council in your inbox.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/why-thousands-of-migrants-are-being-detained-by-the-u-s-as-witnesses,  John Yang John Yang   Sarah Cutler Columbia Journalism Fellow Sarah Cutler Columbia Journalism Fellow   Harry Zahn Harry Zahn  Over the past 20 years tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants have been sent to jail and held as potential witnesses in human smuggling cases many for six months or longer. A New York Times investigation examined this largely overlooked aspect of the immigration debate. Sarah Cutler the lead author of the investigation joins John Yang to discuss. Notice Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Over the past 20 years tens of thousands of undocumented immigrants along the southern border have been sent to jail hundreds of them for six months or longer. They werent sent to jail because theyd been charged with a crime. They were being held as material witnesses against the people accused of helping them cross the border. A New York Times investigation examined this largely over aspect of the immigration debate they found that the material witness law has been administered haphazardly often with little regard for the constitutional rights that apply to all people inside U. S. borders. Sarah Cutler is the lead author of the times investigation and a fellow here at the NewsHour. Sarah in your article youve got a story about a young woman from Guatemala who was pregnant when she was sent to jail. What happened to her? Yes that was a really tough story. This was a woman who was 26 came from Guatemala to seek asylum in the United States and she was chosen selected as a witness. And while she was detained she gave birth. She gave birth zip tied with U.S. Marshals standing watch in the hospital. And after three days after the birth she was forced to give up her child. Her sister was going to come pick up the child and she wasnt reunited with the child for another two months. And what really jumped out to us about this story is that after all of this happened to her she never actually gave testimony. Thats actually very common because in the vast majority of cases over 99 percent of cases these cases dont go to trial. They end in a plea bargain. A plea deal. So its very common actually for witnesses to be detained but not actually give testimony. Lets take a step back. Why are these witnesses in jail to begin with? Right. This is actually the material witness law is very old. It goes back to George Washingtons presidency and the original intent or many of its uses have been in cases where a witness may be afraid of a defendant may not want to testify perhaps a situation like gang violence. But basically the law says if a witness has material very important information and theres reason to believe the witness wont come to trial then that is sufficient to hold a witness in jail. So in this situation because these folks are undocumented the claim is that they either will flee and wont show up to trial or they might actually be deported before the trial takes place. So there is a bit of a disconnect between the courts and immigration. The idea that you might be deported before the courts are done with you. What kind of conditions are they held under? Are they being held literally like a criminal defendant? Yes. So in many cases folks are held. Theyre in U.S. Marshals custody and U.S. Marshals contracts with a range of federal facilities local jails. So we spoke to one sheriff in Laredo. Or in a facility that holds most of Laredos material witnesses and he said yes these folks are wearing the same uniform the orange uniform. They have to be handcuffed and ankle cuffed during transit. So they are in many cases treated just like prisoners. I think what really jumped out to me was that we continued from a lot of folks we heard this perception that you know you are here illegally. You committed a crime by coming to the country illegally so you could be in jail for that crime. But what we learned which was surprising is that especially since COVID its quite common that folks who are charged for coming illegally for the first time illegal entry receive very short very light sentences perhaps time served or a couple of days. So the irony is that you may spend more time in custody as a witness than you would have if you had been charged for the crime offendering illegally. And as I said this has been going on for two decades for 20 years. Talk about sort of the how many weve seen since the George W. Bush administration. Right. So those numbers went up significantly under the Bush administration. They went up significantly under the Trump administration. They dipped with the onset of COVID I think there was a slowdown in prosecuting smuggling cases but we have seen them rise again so those numbers do continue to stay pretty high. And this is an overlooked aspect. Why do you think no ones been saying more about this? There arent more advocates talking about this. Yeah that was something that surprised us as well. I think that along the border this is fairly well known that this practice occurs but away from the border less so. And I would say that its because these folks kind of fall through the cracks. Theyre not looking at as much potential jail time as a defendant in a case like this. And so theres not as much focus on them from the courts perspective. And I think that its just something thats fallen through the cracks for that reason. And under the material witness law is there any limit in the law about how long they can be held? The law does not specify a limit. It says you can be held for a reasonable period of time and actually kind of advocates that your testimony be taken by a video deposition and then you be released quickly because its not specifically stated. Theres a wide variation along the border. So for example in Arizona there tends to be in Tucson theres a 30day limit typically. In New Mexico actually theyve found a way to let most of their witnesses out on bond or into the community until trial. Whereas in Laredo for example folks tend to be held until trial as long as theyre needed. And is this variance is just judge by judge court by court. It totally varies. Sometimes theres local rules at a district level sometimes theres standing orders in a court but it varies. Theres no uniform policy coming down from DOJ governing how this should happen.

https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/the-questions-you-probably-think-you-know-the-answer-to-but-likely-dont-about-ice-detention, Immigrations and Customs Enforcement ICE pronounced ice like a cube detention is civil detention. It is not intended to be punishment for a criminal conviction though conditions are often as bad or worse than those you d find in prison. It may be shocking to learn that the U.S. government detains tens of thousands of people each day in immigrant detention. ICE detention exists to ensure people who are currently going through immigration proceedings in the U.S. attend their court dates. An immigration judge can also determine a person s release presents a danger to the community a subjective determination that isn t necessarily accurate or fair. ICE detention also serves to effectuate deportation orders for people who are out of legal options to stay in this country. Generally people in ICE detention are in limbo waiting to learn whether they can legally remain in the country or whether they will be deported. Immigration detention rips tens of thousands of people away from their families and their communities including longtime residents who are our neighbors coworkers and family members. This country has not always spent taxpayer money to lock up immigrants. Until the 1980s when the private prison profiteers began to flourish immigrants were free while they navigated the legal process. In many ways the detention system mirrors the growth of our mass incarceration crisis the same machinery that leads to the overpolicing and disproportionate sentencing of Black and Brown people in a criminal context has led to growth in the immigration context as well. Now jails and prisons that emptied out due to criminal justice reforms have turned into detention facilities. Many of them are run by forprofit providers more on that later. The immigrant detention system is marred by the rampant abuse neglect and degradation of detained people. These trends have only worsened under the Trump administration with reports of increased use of force solitary confinement patterns of sexual abuse and an utter failure to protect people from COVID19. Fiscal Year 2020 which ended Sept. 30 was the deadliest year in ICE detention in 15 years. Many people are surprised to learn that there really aren t any legal paths to citizenship for many if not most of the 11 million undocumented people in this country. But some of the people in detention did take the legal route including by presenting themselves at a port of entry to apply for asylum. These people have sought refuge in the U.S. and they have been caged as a result. For many of them there is no clear path out of detention much less to legal citizenship. Many people in detention have no way to contact lawyers or money to pay for them. Many detention centers are in rural locations far from legal organizations advocates or other resources to help people navigate the complex system. This problem has only been exacerbated in recent years. An ACLU report released earlier this year found that the more than 40 detention facilities that have opened under Trump have 75 percent fewer lawyers within a 100 mile radius than those opened under prior administrations. The immigration system lacks many of the protections that are triggered when someone is charged with a crime. If someone poses a threat to public safety we want to operate in a system that requires the government to show probable cause before an independent judge with the defendant having access to the full range of due process protections. This is not available in the immigration system. It s important to keep in mind that immigrants who committed a crime serve criminal sentences in prisons and jails just like U.S. citizens do. Once they have served that time they should be released just as U.S. citizens are. Instead many serve a double punishment facing detention and deportation after they ve already served their criminal sentence. In some instances people are locked up in immigration detention even longer than their initial criminal sentence. The vast majority of people in immigrant detention 81 percent according to our recent report are detained in facilities that are owned andor operated by forprofit providers like CoreCivic Geo Group and LaSalle. That number jumps to 91 percent when you only consider people in facilities opened under the Trump administration. There is simply no way to extricate the profit motive from the vast system of detention that exists in this country. The profit motive also helps to explain why the medical care food and accommodations for detained people are so completely inadequate. These companies receive a certain amount of money per person which leads to a negative financial incentive to provide good care. That s why we routinely hear stories of people with cancer being given ibuprofen for example or people having to go to court to access soap during a pandemic. Instead of spending millions of dollars imprisoning people looking to build a new life in the U.S. we could help them navigate the legal process and land on their feet. The data show that most undocumented people show up for court. Detention is not necessary nor is it a humane or acceptable de facto response. We do not jail everyone who is awaiting court dates in the criminal legal system because it is a clear violation of their civil liberties and our constitution protects against that. The same logic should apply to our immigration system. We can build a system that supports immigrants and the government s interests without the cost and the abuses that are part of this fundamentally flawed system. There are a number of communitybased alternatives to detention that are just as effective for ensuring people show up to court save taxpayers money and are vastly more humane. The Family Case Management Program FCMP for example connected families with a case manager and legal support and boasted a 99 percent success rate as reported by ICE. It cost just 36 a day per family compared to 319 per day per person for family detention. The Trump administration ended the program in June 2017 but Presidentelect Biden has pledged to invest in communitybased management programs. We will fight to ensure that people are allowed to remain with their families and communities while their immigration cases are pending.
https://cis.org/Fact-Sheet/Why-Immigration-Detention-Necessary, Whistleblower Contact Whistleblower Contact Detention of aliens who are in violation of immigration laws is authorized and in some cases mandated by various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA the primary statutory foundation of federal law codified within Title 8 of the U.S. Code. Because immigration detention is civil unlike criminal detention after conviction its purpose is not to punish. Rather immigration detention is solely for the purpose of holding in confinement aliens charged with violating the immigration laws while their removal proceedings are pending and if ordered removed up to and including the act of repatriation to the country of 1 origin 2 last habitual residence or 3 from which the alien last departed prior to entering the United States. Congress in enacting the detentionrelated provisions of the INA has recognized both the quantitative and qualitative problems associated with illegal immigration. In each situation with the exception of circumstances in which detention is mandated by the INA detention decisions are to be made in each individual case based on whether the alien constitutes a risk of flight or a risk to public safety. Thus the options available to immigration officers consist of The problem in a nutshell is that when an alien is released pending removal chances are high that sooner or later he will flee. It shouldnt be a surprise. Many aliens will appear at removal hearings as long as there is any chance whatsoever of some form of relief and of being permitted to stay but once that becomes a remote possibility or disappears altogether why would they stick around? After all the worst that can happen if they flee and are later picked up is what was going to happen anyway They will be removed. This is why right now on the streets of America there are more than 904000 aliens under outstanding but unexecuted orders of removal. In any other due process system this would be both a shock and a national disgrace our political leaders would be rushing to file amending legislation and take effective operational steps to reverse the status quo. It has not happened in the immigration environment because of the polarized national dialogue about immigration generally. By qualitative we mean those aspects of immigration law touching on public safety or national security. Aliens who are inadmissible or deportable under such grounds of removability are generally understood to constitute a higher enforcement and removal priority and as such are often required to be held without bond or other conditional release until removed. This is true for instance of alien felons INA Section 236c 8 U.S.C. 1226c and alien terrorists INA Section 236A 8 U.S.C. 1226a. By quantitative we mean those aspects of immigration law that touch on the enormous magnitude of the problem of illegal immigration confronting our country. Thus while aliens in this category dont for the most part represent the same kind of risk as alien criminals or national security threats simply by volume they pose a real possibility of collapsing the nations system of immigration control if they are not dealt with effectively. Every year hundreds of thousands of aliens are apprehended illegally crossing U.S. land and sea borders. One way that Congress has addressed that issue is to provide for expedited removal of aliens apprehended close in time 14 days or place 100 miles to their illegal border crossing. While the law does not specifically require mandatory detention of such individuals it is implied by the directive that the inspecting officer order the alien removed from the United States without further hearing or review unless the alien indicates either an intention to apply for asylum ... or a fear of persecution. INA Section 235b1Ai 8 U.S.C. 1225b1Ai. The problem is that many if not most illegal aliens are wellversed on the fact that simply by claiming a fear of return they increase their chances of release. Faced with a limited number of detention beds and the likelihood of keeping such an alien for an indefinite period of time while the removal hearing proceeds and the asylum claim is adjudicated the government releases most of these individuals a phenomenon known as catchandrelease in order to save those beds for higher priority cases such as the alien criminals mentioned earlier. Unfortunately when aliens are released they are placed into the nondetained docket of the immigration courts that face a backlog of more than 764000 cases and waits of two years or more before hearings even commence. Meanwhile aliens either disappear having achieved their goal of release or wait around long enough for the regulatory period to toll after which they can ask for work permits while their cases are pending. Thus the cycle deepens. Worse we have reached the stage where the sorts of aliens illegally crossing the border have changed A huge percentage of the individuals now being apprehended and processed are women and children. This is because they see asylum loopholes catchandrelease policies and a troubled nation confronting questions about the detention or separation of families as working in their favor. Unfortunately this has placed the United States into the position of inadvertently acting as a coconspirator in the smuggling of these most vulnerable human beings by the thousands across hostile terrain in the hands of criminals and cartels. A recent report by Medicins sans Frontieres Doctors Without Borders estimates that In addition to the hundreds of thousands of illegal bordercrossers additional hundreds of thousands more arrive legally as nonimmigrants but then overstay or otherwise violate their visas and remain. Of these visitors aliens from 38 approved countries enter under the Visa Waiver Program VWP pursuant to INA Section 217 8 U.S.C. 1187 which waives the need to procure a visa from a U.S. consular officer abroad. Subsection 217b requires that prior to entry the alien execute a waiver of rights that permits immigration officers at ports of entry to reject and return the alien to his place of embarkation if he is determined at inspection not to be a legitimate nonimmigrant visitor. Subsection b also permits prompt removal of the alien without resort to a hearing if he overstays or otherwise violates the conditions of admission after entry. Thus as in expedited removal detention up to the point of actual repatriation is implied subject however to the same caveat that all bets are off if the alien seeks asylum. Its clear that the nation is fast approaching a fault line in balancing the need for prompt adjudication and removal of aliens with a fair opportunity to be heard. Part of the answer must lie with effective remedial legislation that recognizes and addresses abuse of the asylum and credible fear of return processes and provides brightline rules for detention that help to ensure this comes to pass. At the same time the administration must do a better job of explaining why detention is necessary if we are to remain a nation of laws that exercises the sovereign right to decide who may enter our borders rather than ceding the decision to the aliens themselves. The imminent arrival of a second caravan of thousands of mostly Central Americans and rumors of a third already forming heading to our southern border may force this decision upon all concerned sooner rather than later. It may be time for the administration to invoke the mass migration emergency provisions in the INA that are already available including INA Section 103a10 8 USC 1103a10 Section 212f 8 USC 1182f and Section 215 8 USC 1185.  The Center for Immigration Studies is an independent nonpartisan nonprofit research organization founded in 1985. It is the nations only think tank devoted exclusively to research and policy analysis of the economic social demographic fiscal and other impacts of immigration on the United States.
