Israeli forces are deliberately blocking the delivery of water food and fuel while willfully impeding humanitarian assistance apparently razing agricultural areas and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to their survival. Since Hamasled fighters attacked Israel on October 7 2023 highranking Israeli officials including Defense Minister Yoav Gallant National Security Minister Itamar BenGvir and Energy Minister Israel Katz have made public statements expressing their aim to deprive civilians in Gaza of food water and fuel statements reflecting a policy being carried out by Israeli forces. Other Israeli officials have publicly stated that humanitarian aid to Gaza would be conditioned either on the release of hostages unlawfully held by Hamas or Hamas destruction.  For over two months Israel has been depriving Gazas population of food and water a policy spurred on or endorsed by highranking Israeli officials and reflecting an intent to starve civilians as a method of warfare said Omar Shakir Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. World leaders should be speaking out against this abhorrent war crime which has devastating effects on Gaza s population.  Human Rights Watch interviewed 11 displaced Palestinians in Gaza between November 24 and December 4. They described their profound hardships in securing basic necessities. We had no food no electricity no internet nothing at all said one man who had left northern Gaza. We don t know how we survived.  In southern Gaza those interviewed described the scarcity of potable water the lack of food leading to empty shops and lengthy lines and exorbitant prices. You are on a constant search for things needed to survive said a father of two. The United Nations World Food Programme WFP reported on December 6 that 9 out of 10 households in northern Gaza and 2 out of 3 households in southern Gaza had spent at least one full day and night without food. International humanitarian law or the laws of war prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that intentionally starving civilians by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival including willfully impeding relief supplies is a war crime. Criminal intent does not require the attacker s admission but can also be inferred from the totality of the circumstances of the military campaign. In addition Israel s continuing blockade of Gaza as well as its more than 16year closure amounts to collective punishment of the civilian population a war crime. As the occupying power in Gaza under the Fourth Geneva Convention Israel has the duty to ensure that the civilian population gets food and medical supplies. On November 17 the WFP warned of the immediate possibility of starvation highlighting that supplies of food and water were practically nonexistent. On December 3 it reported a high risk of famine indicating that Gaza s food system was on the brink of collapse. And on December 6 it declared that 48 percent of households in northern Gaza and 38 percent of displaced people in southern Gaza had experienced severe levels of hunger.  On November 3 the Norwegian Refugee Council announced that Gaza was grappling with catastrophic water sanitation and hygiene needs. Wastewater and desalination facilities were shut down in midOctober due to fuel and electricity shortages and have been largely inoperable since according to the Palestinian Water Authority. Even before October 7 according to the UN Gaza had virtually no potable water. Prior to the current hostilities 1.2 million of Gaza s 2.2 million people were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity and over 80 percent were reliant on humanitarian aid. Israel maintains overarching control over Gaza including over the movement of people and goods territorial waters airspace the infrastructure upon which Gaza relies as well as the registry of the population. This leaves Gaza s population which Israel has subjected to an unlawful closure for 16 years almost entirely dependent on Israel for access to fuel electricity medicine food and other essential commodities. After the imposition of a total blockade on Gaza on October 9 Israeli authorities resumed piping water to some parts of southern Gaza on October 15 and as of October 21 allowed limited humanitarian aid to arrive through the Rafah crossing with Egypt. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on October 18 that Israel would not allow humanitarian assistance in the form of food and medicines into Gaza through its crossings as long as our hostages are not returned.  The government continued to block the entry of fuel until November 15 despite warnings about the serious consequences of doing so leading to the shutdown of bakeries hospitals sewage pumping stations water desalination plants and wells. These facilities which have been left unusable are indispensable to the civilian population s survival. Although limited amounts of fuel were subsequently allowed in on December 4 the UN Humanitarian Coordinator for the Occupied Palestinian Territory Lynn Hastings called it utterly insufficient. On December 6 Israel s war cabinet approved a minimal increase in fuel supplies to southern Gaza. On December 1 immediately after the sevenday ceasefire the Israeli military resumed bombing Gaza and expanded its ground offensive stating that its military operations in the south would carry no less strength than in the north. While United States officials said that they urged Israel to allow fuel and humanitarian aid to enter Gaza at the same levels observed during the ceasefire the Defense Ministry s coordinator of government activities in the territories said on December 1 that it halted all aid entry. Limited aid deliveries resumed on December 2 but still at grossly insufficient levels according to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA. Alongside the crushing blockade the Israeli military s extensive airstrikes in the strip have resulted in widespread damage or destruction to objects necessary for the survival of the civilian population. UN experts said on November 16 that the significant damage threatens to make the continuation of Palestinian life in Gaza impossible. Notably Israeli forces bombing of Gaza s last operational wheat mill on November 15 ensures that locally produced flour will be unavailable in Gaza for the foreseeable future as highlighted by OCHA. Additionally the UN Office for Project Services UNOPS said that the decimation of road networks had made it more difficult for humanitarian organizations to deliver aid to those who need it.  Bakeries and grain mills have been destroyed agriculture water and sanitation facilities Scott Paul a senior humanitarian policy adviser for Oxfam America told the Associated Press on November 23. Israel s military actions in Gaza have also had a devastating impact on Gaza s agricultural sector. The sustained bombardment coupled with fuel and water shortages alongside the displacement of more than 1.6 million people to southern Gaza has made farming nearly impossible according to Oxfam. In a report from November 28 OCHA said that livestock in the north are facing starvation due to the shortage of fodder and water and that crops are increasingly abandoned and damaged due to lack of fuel to pump irrigation water. Existing problems such as water scarcity and restricted access to farming land near the border fence have compounded the difficulties faced by local farmers many of whom are displaced. On November 28 the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics said that Gaza is suffering from at least a US1.6 million daily loss in farm production. On November 28 the Palestine Food Security Sector led by the WFP and the Food and Agriculture Organization reported that over a third of agricultural land in the north had been damaged in the hostilities. Satellite imagery reviewed by Human Rights Watch indicates that since the start of the Israeli militarys ground offensive on October 27 agricultural land including orchards greenhouses and farmland in northern Gaza has been razed apparently by Israeli forces. The Israeli government should immediately cease using starvation of civilians as a method of warfare Human Rights Watch said. It should abide by the prohibition on attacks on objects necessary for the survival of the civilian population and lift its blockade of the Gaza Strip. The government should restore water and electricity access and allow desperately needed food medical aid and fuel into Gaza including via its crossing at Kerem Shalom. Concerned governments should call on Israel to end these abuses. The United States the United Kingdom Canada Germany and other countries should also suspend military assistance and arms sales to Israel as long as its forces continue to commit widespread and serious abuses amounting to war crimes against civilians with impunity.  The Israeli government is compounding its collective punishment of Palestinian civilians and the blocking of humanitarian aid by its cruel use of starvation as a weapon of war Shakir said. The deepening humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza calls for an urgent and effective response from the international community.  The Hamasled attacks in southern Israel on October 7 killed at least 1200 Israelis and foreign nationals with more than 200 people taken hostage acts amounting to war crimes. The resulting Israeli bombardment and ground offensive resulted in more than 18700 Palestinians killed including more than 7700 children according to Gaza authorities. UN experts stated on November 16 that half of Gaza s civilian infrastructure had been destroyed. OCHA reported that as of December 10 over half of Gaza s housing units had been damaged or destroyed as provided by the Ministry of Public Works and Housing in Gaza as well as hospitals schools mosques bakeries water pipes sewage and electricity networks. On November 4 and 5 alone according to OCHA seven water facilities across the Gaza Strip were directly hit and sustained major damage including water reservoirs in Gaza City the Jabalia refugee camp and Rafah.  The Israeli military s repeated apparently unlawful attacks on medical facilities personnel and transport are further destroying Gaza s healthcare sector thereby affecting the population s ability to access lifesaving treatment including to prevent diseases wasting and deaths linked to malnutrition exacerbating the dire ramifications of starvation. We will see more people dying from disease than from bombardment if we are not able to put back together this health system the World Health Organizations Margaret Harris said on November 28. On October 13 Israeli authorities issued an order for more than a million people to evacuate northern Gaza within 24 hours an order that was impossible to comply with. Since then and as conditions in the north worsened hundreds of thousands have been displaced to Rafah and Khan Younis governorates in the south where it has become increasingly difficult to secure the means to survive. Under international humanitarian law evacuations must be carried out under conditions that ensure those displaced have access to unimpeded humanitarian aid including sufficient food and work otherwise they may amount to forcible displacement. Evacuations that would increase the likelihood of starvation are prohibited. The humanitarian consequences of Israel s military actions in Gaza have been severe. During the first eight weeks of hostilities northern Gaza was the focus of the Israeli military s intense air and later ground offensive. Except for the sevenday ceasefire that began on November 24 during which UN convoys brought in limited quantities of flour and highenergy biscuits aid access to the north had been largely severed. Between November 7 and at least November 15 none of the bakeries in the north were operational due to the lack of fuel water wheat flour and structural damage according to OCHA. According to the WFP there is a serious risk of starvation and famine in Gaza. UN officials have said that 1.9 million people over 85 percent of Gazas population are internally displaced adding that the conditions in an evershrinking southern area of the Gaza strip could become even more hellish.  UN aid chief Martin Griffiths stated on December 5 that the Israeli military campaign in southern Gaza had led to apocalyptic conditions making meaningful humanitarian operations impossible. As of December 6 the only water desalination plant in northern Gaza was nonfunctional and the pipeline supplying water to the north from Israel remained closed increasing the risk of dehydration and waterborne diseases arising from the consumption of water from unsafe sources. Hospitals have been particularly hard hit with only 1 of 24 hospitals in northern Gaza functional and able to admit new patients although services are limited as of December 14. Across Gaza the humanitarian crisis deepened with a persistent electricity blackout since October 11 as well as several communications shutdowns that denied people access to reliable safety information emergency medical services and severely hindered humanitarian operations with OCHA saying on November 18 that the telecommunications blackout between November 16 and 18 the fourth such blackout since October 7 brought the already challenging delivery of humanitarian assistance to an almost complete halt including lifesaving assistance to people injured or trapped under the rubble as a result of airstrikes and clashes. Another telecommunications blackout took place on December 14. Since the beginning of the Israeli military s ground offensive on October 27 satellite imagery reviewed by Human Rights Watch indicates that orchards greenhouses and farmland in northern Gaza have been razed apparently by Israeli forces compounding concerns of dire food insecurity and loss of livelihood. Satellite imagery indicates that the razing of agricultural land continued in northern Gaza during the sevenday ceasefire which began on November 24 and ended on December 1 when the Israeli military was in direct control of the area. While the Israeli government allowed a steady and slightly increased stream of humanitarian aid including cooking gas for the first time since October 7 to enter the Gaza Strip during the sevenday ceasefire that ended on December 1 it deliberately hindered the entry of relief supplies at the scale needed for over a month prior while it imposed a siege affecting the entire civilian population. This contributed to a catastrophic humanitarian situation of farreaching consequences with over 80 percent of the population internally displaced many of whom have been sheltering in overcrowded unhealthy and unsanitary conditions at UN shelters in the south. The aid that entered during the ceasefire barely registers against the huge needs of 1.7 million displaced people said UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric on November 27. Some 200 trucks including four tankers carrying up to 130000 liters of fuel and four tankers of cooking gas entered Gaza each day of the ceasefire. In comparison an average of 500 trucks of food and goods entered Gaza each day before the conflict and 600000 liters of fuel are needed in Gaza per day just to operate water and desalinization plants. As the bombardment resumed and Israeli forces advanced south aid access was again severely hindered. On December 5 for the third consecutive day OCHA reported that only Rafah governorate in Gaza received limited aid distributions. In the adjacent Khan Younis governorate it said aid distribution largely stopped due to the intensity of hostilities. Human Rights Watch spoke to 11 civilians who evacuated northern Gaza to the perceived safety of the south due to heavy bombardment fear of imminent airstrikes or because Israel ordered them to evacuate. Several said they were displaced a number of times before reaching the south as they struggled to find suitable shelters and safety along their journey. In the south they found overcrowded shelters empty markets and soaring prices and long lines for limited supplies of bread and drinking water. To protect their identities Human Rights Watch is using pseudonyms for all those interviewed.  I have to walk three kilometers to get one gallon of water said 30yearold Marwan who fled to the south with his pregnant wife and two children on November 9. And there is no food. If we are able to find food it is canned food. Not all of us are eating well.   We don t have enough of anything said 36yearold Hana who fled her home in the north to Khan Younis in the south with her father his wife and her brother on October 11. She said that in the south they don t always have access to clean water forcing them to drink nonpotable salty water. Bathing has become a luxury she said due to the lack of means to heat water requiring them to scavenge for wood. In desperate situations she said they even resort to burning old clothes for cooking. The process of making bread poses its own challenges given the scarcity of ingredients that they cannot afford. We make bad bread because we don t have all the ingredients and we cannot afford it she said. Majed 34 who fled with his wife and four surviving children to the south on or around November 10 said that while the situation in the south was dire it was incomparable to what he and his family had to endure while staying in the north. They had been in an area near alShifa hospital in Gaza City for just over a month after their house was bombed on October 13 killing Majed s 6yearold son  In those 33 days we didn t have bread because there was no flour he said. There was no water we were buying water sometimes for US10 a cup. It wasn t always drinkable. Sometimes the water we drank was from the bathroom and sometimes from the sea. The markets around the area were empty. There wasn t even canned food.  Taher 32 who fled south with his family on November 11 described similar conditions in Gaza city in the first weeks of November. The city was out of everything of food and water he said. If you find canned food the prices were so high. We decided to eat just once a day to survive. We were running out of money. We decided to just have the necessities to have less of everything.  Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited under article 541 of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions Protocol I and article 14 of the Second Additional Protocol Protocol II. Although Israel is not a party to Protocols I or II the prohibition is recognized as reflective of customary international humanitarian law in both international and noninternational armed conflicts. Parties to a conflict may not provoke starvation deliberately or deliberately cause the population to suffer hunger particularly by depriving it of its sources of food or of supplies.  Warring parties are also prohibited from attacking objects indispensable to the survival of the civilian population such as food and medical supplies agricultural areas and drinking water installations. They are obligated to facilitate rapid and unimpeded humanitarian assistance to all civilians in need and to not deliberately block humanitarian aid or restrict the freedom of movement of humanitarian relief personnel. In each of its four previous wars in Gaza since 2008 Israel maintained the flow of drinking water and electricity into Gaza and opened the Israeli crossings for humanitarian delivery. Evidence of intent to deliberately use starvation as a method of warfare can be demonstrated by public statements of officials involved in military operations. The following highranking Israeli officials could be expected to play a significant role in determining policy with respect to allowing or blocking food and other necessities to the civilian population. On October 9 Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said We are imposing a complete siege on Gaza. No electricity no food no water no fuel everything is closed. We are fighting human animals and we must act accordingly.  National Security Minister Itamar BenGvir said in a tweet on October 17 So long as Hamas does not release the hostages the only thing that should enter Gaza is hundreds of tons of air force explosives not an ounce of humanitarian aid.  Energy Minister Israel Katz who reported that he ordered the cuts to electricity and water said on October 11  For years we have given Gaza electricity water and fuel. Instead of a thank you they sent thousands of human animals to butcher murder rape and kidnap babies women and elderly people. This is why we have decided to cut off the supply of water electricity and fuel and now the local power plant has collapsed and there is no electricity in Gaza. We will keep holding a tight siege until the Hamas threat is lifted from Israel and the world. What has been will be no more.  Katz said on October 12  Humanitarian aid to Gaza? Not a switch will be flicked on not a valve will be opened not a fuel truck will enter until the Israeli hostages come home. Humanitarian for humanitarian. Let no one lecture us about morality.  He said on October 16  I supported the agreement between PM Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Biden to supply water to the southern Gaza Strip because it aligned with Israeli interests too. I am vehemently opposed to lifting the blockade and letting goods into Gaza for humanitarian reasons. Our commitment is to the families of the murdered and to the kidnapped hostages not Hamas murderers and the people who helped them.  On November 4 Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich declared that no fuel must enter Gaza under any circumstances. He later called Israel s war cabinet s decision to permit small amounts to enter the strip a grave mistake and said that it stop this scandal immediately and prevent fuel from coming into the Strip as reported by the Jerusalem Post. In a video posted online on November 4 Col. Yogev BarShesht deputy head of the Civil Administration said in an interview from inside Gaza Whoever returns here if they return here after will find scorched earth. No houses no agriculture no nothing. They have no future.  On November 24 in a televised interview with CNN Mark Regev senior adviser to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel was depriving Gaza of fuel since October 7 to strengthen Israel s position when it came to negotiating with Hamas on release of hostages. Had we done so allowed the fuel in we would never have gotten our hostages out he said. On December 1 the Defense Ministry s coordinator of government activities in the territories Maj. Gen. Ghassan Alian said that the entry of fuel and aid to Gaza was halted after Hamas violated the conditions of the ceasefire agreement. His office confirmed his statement in response to a Times of Israel query stating After the Hamas terror organization violated the agreement and in addition fired at Israel the entry of humanitarian aid was stopped in the manner stipulated in the agreement.  Other officials have since October 7 called for the limited entry of humanitarian aid to Gaza saying that doing so serves Israel s military aims. Prime Minister Netanyahu on December 5 answered a question about Israel potentially losing leverage against Hamas if it allowed more humanitarian aid into Gaza saying The war efforts are supported by the humanitarian effort this is because we follow laws of war because we know that if there would be a collapse diseases pandemics and groundwater infections it will stop the fighting.  Defense Minister Gallant said We re required to allow the humanitarian minimum to allow for the military pressure to continue.  Tzachi Hanegbi Israels national security adviser said at a news conference on November 17 If there is an epidemic the fighting will be stopped. If there is a humanitarian crisis and an international outcry we will not be able to continue the fighting under those conditions.  On October 18 the Office of the Prime Minister announced that Israel would not prevent humanitarian aid from entering Gaza from Egypt following pressure from the US and other international allies  In light of President Biden s demand Israel will not thwart humanitarian supplies from Egypt as long as it is only food water and medicine for the civilian population in the southern Gaza Strip.  Destruction of Agricultural Products and Impacts on Food Production During ground operations in northern Gaza Israeli forces have apparently destroyed agricultural products exacerbating shortages of food with longterm effects. This has included razing orchards fields and greenhouses.  October 15 2023 2023 Planet Labs PBC November 24 2023 2023 Planet Labs PBC Israels military said it conducted military operations in the Beit Hanoun area including in an undisclosed agricultural area in Beit Hanoun to clear tunnels and other military objectives. Fields and orchards north of Beit Hanoun for example were first damaged during hostilities following Israel s ground operations in late October. Bulldozers carved new roads clearing the way for Israeli military vehicles. Since midNovember after Israeli forces took control of the same area in northeastern Gaza satellite imagery shows that orchards fields and greenhouses have been systematically razed leaving sand and dirt. Human Rights Watch contacted the Israel Defense Forces for comment on December 8 but has not received a response.  November 11 2023 2023 Planet Labs PBC November 24 2023 2023 Planet Labs PBC Farmers in this area planted crops such as citrus fruit potatoes dragon fruit and prickly pear contributing to the livelihoods of Palestinians in Gaza. Other crops include tomatoes cabbage and strawberries. Some plots were razed in a day. Trees that yield citrus fruit as well as the cacti that yield dragon fruit take years of care to mature before they can yield fruit. High resolution satellite imagery shows bulldozers were used to destroy fields and orchards. Tracks are visible as well as mounds of earth on the edges of the former plots. Whether by deliberate razing damage due to hostilities or the inability to irrigate or work the land farmland across northern Gaza has been drastically reduced since the beginning of the Israeli ground operations. Farms and farmers in southern Gaza have also been affected. Action Against Hunger found that of 113 farmers from southern Gaza surveyed between October 19 and 31 60 percent reported that their assets andor crops have been damaged 42 percent reported that they had no access to water to irrigate their farms and 43 percent reported that they were unable to harvest their crops. 12182023 This news release has been updated to reflect the October date on which Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would not allow humanitarian assistance in the form food and medicines into Gaza through its crossings as long as Israels hostages are not returned.  1152024 This news release has been updated to reflect the correct attribution for statistics provided regarding the damage and destruction to civilian infrastructure in Gaza.

Fiftytwo countries and three international organizations will participate in the oral proceedings more than in any other case since the world s highest court began functioning in 1946. The broad participation in the hearings and the many written submissions reflect growing global momentum to address the decadeslong failure to ensure respect for international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.  The International Court of Justice is set for the first time to broadly consider the legal consequences of Israel s nearly sixdecadeslong occupation and mistreatment of the Palestinian people said Clive Baldwin senior legal adviser at Human Rights Watch. Governments that are presenting their arguments to the court should seize these landmark hearings to highlight the grave abuses Israeli authorities are committing against Palestinians including the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.  The oral proceedings stem from a December 2022 request by the United Nations General Assembly for an advisory opinion by the court on the legal consequences of Israel s policies and practices in the Occupied Palestinian Territory. The court has the opportunity to address the prolonged occupation to consider Israel s practices and policies violating international legal prohibitions against racial discrimination including the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution and to appraise the legal responsibilities of other countries and the UN to address violations of international law arising from the occupation. Although ICJ advisory opinions are nonbinding they can carry great moral and legal authority and can ultimately become part of customary international law which is legally binding on states. These proceedings which will last six days are distinct from the case brought by South Africa to the same court alleging that Israel is violating the Genocide Convention amid the hostilities between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups that escalated following the October 7 2023 Hamasled attacks. The General Assembly first asked the ICJ for an advisory opinion related to the Occupied Palestinian Territory in December 2003. In July 2004 the ICJ s advisory opinion found that the route of Israel s separation barrier violated international law and that it should be dismantled. The December 2022 request to the court is wider in scope. The General Assembly asked the court to give its opinion on the legal consequences arising from the ongoing violation by Israel of the right of the Palestinian people to selfdetermination from its prolonged occupation settlement and annexation of the Occupied Palestinian Territory including its adoption of related discriminatory legislation and measures and on the legal consequences of the occupation and Israel s practices for all states and the UN. The request provides the court the opportunity to evaluate the situation two decades after its last advisory opinion on the Occupied Palestinian Territory and provide guidance on the law including the continued application of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The court could also assess Israel s conduct under international human rights law including prohibitions on racial discrimination and international criminal law including the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution. The ICJ adjudicates disputes between states and issues advisory opinions on international law. It lacks jurisdiction over the conduct of nonstate armed groups like Hamas. The International Criminal Court ICC by contrast addresses serious international crimes allegedly committed by individuals including members of armed groups. The ICC prosecutor confirmed that since March 2021 his office has been conducting an investigation into alleged atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank since 2014 and that the court has jurisdiction over international crimes committed by all parties in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups. Human Rights Watch has documented that Israeli authorities are committing the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution against Palestinians. Given that the responsibilities of an occupying power toward the rights of the occupied population increase over time Human Rights Watch has also called for Israel to provide Palestinians in the occupied territory with rights at least equal to those it grants its own citizens in addition to the protections of international humanitarian law. The ICJ is composed of 15 judges elected by the UN General Assembly and Security Council for nineyear terms. Fiftyseven states and international organizations had filed a written statement in the proceedings in July 2023 before the October escalation in hostilities. Fifteen states and international organizations filed additional written comments in October and November 2023. Among those participating in the oral proceedings are Palestine South Africa Belgium Brazil the United States Russia France China Namibia Pakistan Indonesia the United Kingdom Switzerland and the African Union. Israel submitted a written statement and chose not to participate in the oral hearings. The ICJ will issue its legal opinion at a date to be determined. Past practice suggests that the opinion will be issued before the end of 2024.

Photo Michael NigroSipa via AP Images Leaked NYT Gaza Memo Tells Journalists to Avoid Words Genocide Ethnic Cleansing and Occupied Territory Amid the internal battle over the New York Times s coverage of Israel s war top editors handed down a set of directives.   Share Copy link Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp The New York Times instructed journalists covering Israel s war on the Gaza Strip to restrict the use of the terms genocide and ethnic cleansing and to avoid using the phrase occupied territory when describing Palestinian land according to a copy of an internal memo obtained by The Intercept. The memo also instructs reporters not to use the word Palestine except in very rare cases and to steer clear of the term refugee camps to describe areas of Gaza historically settled by displaced Palestinians expelled from other parts of Palestine during previous Israeli Arab wars. The areas are recognized by the United Nations as refugee camps and house hundreds of thousands of registered refugees. The memo written by Times standards editor Susan Wessling international editor Philip Pan and their deputies offers guidance about some terms and other issues we have grappled with since the start of the conflict in October.  While the document is presented as an outline for maintaining objective journalistic principles in reporting on the Gaza war several Times staffers told The Intercept that some of its contents show evidence of the paper s deference to Israeli narratives.  I think it s the kind of thing that looks professional and logical if you have no knowledge of the historical context of the PalestinianIsraeli conflict said a Times newsroom source who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal of the Gaza memo. But if you do know it will be clear how apologetic it is to Israel.  First distributed to Times journalists in November the guidance which collected and expanded on past style directives about the Israeli Palestinian conflict has been regularly updated over the ensuing months. It presents an internal window into the thinking of Times international editors as they have faced upheaval within the newsroom surrounding the paper s Gaza war coverage.  Issuing guidance like this to ensure accuracy consistency and nuance in how we cover the news is standard practice said Charlie Stadtlander a Times spokesperson. Across all our reporting including complex events like this we take care to ensure our language choices are sensitive current and clear to our audiences.  Issues over style guidance have been among a bevy of internal rifts at the Times over its Gaza coverage. In January The Intercept reported on disputes in the Times newsroom over issues with an investigative story on systematic sexual violence on October 7. The leak gave rise to a highly unusual internal probe. The company faced harsh criticism for allegedly targeting Times workers of Middle East and North African descent which Times brass denied. On Monday executive editor Joe Kahn told staff that the leak investigation had been concluded unsuccessfully. Almost immediately after the October 7 attacks and the launch of Israel s scorchedearth war against Gaza tensions began to boil within the newsroom over the Times coverage. Some staffers said they believed the paper was going out of its way to defer to Israel s narrative on the events and was not applying even standards in its coverage. Arguments began fomenting on internal Slack and other chat groups. The debates between reporters on the Jerusalem bureauled WhatsApp group which at one point included 90 reporters and editors became so intense that Pan the international editor interceded.  We need to do a better job communicating with each other as we report the news so our discussions are more productive and our disagreements less distracting Pan wrote in a November 28 WhatsApp message viewed by The Intercept and first reported by the Wall Street Journal. At its best this channel has been a quick transparent and productive space to collaborate on a complex fastmoving story. At its worst it s a tense forum where the questions and comments can feel accusatory and personal.  Pan bluntly stated Do not use this channel for raising concerns about coverage.  Among the topics of debate in the Jerusalem bureau WhatsApp group and exchanges on Slack reviewed by The Intercept and verified with multiple newsroom sources were Israeli attacks on AlShifa Hospital statistics on Palestinian civilian deaths the allegations of genocidal conduct by Israel and President Joe Biden s pattern of promoting unverified allegations from the Israeli government as fact. Pan did not respond to a request for comment. Many of the same debates were addressed in the Times s Gazaspecific style guidance and have been the subject of intense public scrutiny.  It s not unusual for news companies to set style guidelines said another Times newsroom source who also asked for anonymity. But there are unique standards applied to violence perpetrated by Israel. Readers have noticed and I understand their frustration.  The Times memo outlines guidance on a range of phrases and terms. The nature of the conflict has led to inflammatory language and incendiary accusations on all sides. We should be very cautious about using such language even in quotations. Our goal is to provide clear accurate information and heated language can often obscure rather than clarify the fact the memo says.  Words like slaughter massacre and carnage often convey more emotion than information. Think hard before using them in our own voice according to the memo. Can we articulate why we are applying those words to one particular situation and not another? As always we should focus on clarity and precision describe what happened rather than using a label.  Despite the memo s framing as an effort to not employ incendiary language to describe killings on all sides in the Times reporting on the Gaza war such language has been used repeatedly to describe attacks against Israelis by Palestinians and almost never in the case of Israel s largescale killing of Palestinians. In January The Intercept published an analysis of New York Times Washington Post and Los Angeles Times coverage of the war from October 7 through November 24 a period mostly before the new Times guidance was issued. The Intercept analysis showed that the major newspapers reserved terms like slaughter massacre and horrific almost exclusively for Israeli civilians killed by Palestinians rather than for Palestinian civilians killed in Israeli attacks. The analysis found that as of November 24 the New York Times had described Israeli deaths as a massacre on 53 occasions and those of Palestinians just once. The ratio for the use of slaughter was 22 to 1 even as the documented number of Palestinians killed climbed to around 15000. The latest Palestinian death toll estimate stands at more than 33000 including at least 15000 children likely undercounts due to Gaza s collapsed health infrastructure and missing persons many of whom are believed to have died in the rubble left by Israel s attacks over the past six months. The Times memo touches on some of the most highly charged and disputed language around the Israeli Palestinian conflict. The guidance spells out for instance usage of the word terrorist which The Intercept previously reported was at the center of a spirited newsroom debate.  It is accurate to use terrorism and terrorist in describing the attacks of Oct. 7 which included the deliberate targeting of civilians in killings and kidnappings according to the leaked Times memo. We should not shy away from that description of the events or the attackers particularly when we provide context and explanation.  The guidance also instructs journalists to Avoid fighters when referring to the Oct. 7 attack the term suggests a conventional war rather than a deliberate attack on civilians. And be cautious in using militants which is interpreted in different ways and may be confusing to readers.  In the memo the editors tell Times journalists We do not need to assign a single label or to refer to the Oct. 7 assault as a terrorist attack in every reference the word is best used when specifically describing attacks on civilians. We should exercise restraint and can vary the language with other accurate terms and descriptions an attack an assault an incursion the deadliest attack on Israel in decades etc. Similarly in addition to terrorists we can vary the terms used to describe the Hamas members who carried out the assault attackers assailants gunmen.  The Times does not characterize Israel s repeated attacks on Palestinian civilians as terrorism even when civilians have been targeted. This is also true of Israel s assaults on protected civilian sites including hospitals. In a section with the headline Genocide and Other Incendiary Language the guidance says Genocide has a specific definition in international law. In our own voice we should generally use it only in the context of those legal parameters. We should also set a high bar for allowing others to use it as an accusation whether in quotations or not unless they are making a substantive argument based on the legal definition.  Regarding ethnic cleansing the document calls it another historically charged term instructing reporters If someone is making such an accusation we should press for specifics or supply proper context.  In the cases of describing occupied territory and the status of refugees in Gaza the Times style guidelines run counter to norms established by the United Nations and international humanitarian law. On the term Palestine a widely used name for both the territory and the U.N.recognized state the Times memo contains blunt instructions Do not use in datelines routine text or headlines except in very rare cases such as when the United Nations General Assembly elevated Palestine to a nonmember observer state or references to historic Palestine. The Times guidance resembles that of the Associated Press Stylebook. The memo directs journalists not to use the phrase refugee camps to describe longstanding refugee settlements in Gaza. While termed refugee camps the refugee centers in Gaza are developed and densely populated neighborhoods dating to the 1948 war. Refer to them as neighborhoods or areas and if further context is necessary explain how they have historically been called refugee camps.  The United Nations recognizes eight refugee camps in the Gaza Strip. As of last year before the war started the areas were home to more than 600000 registered refugees. Many are descendants of those who fled to Gaza after being forcibly expelled from their homes in the 1948 Arab Israeli War which marked the founding of the Jewish state and mass dispossession of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians. The Israeli government has long been hostile to the historical fact that Palestinians maintain refugee status because it signifies that they were displaced from lands they have a right to return to. Since October 7 Israel has repeatedly bombed refugee camps in Gaza including Jabaliya Al Shati Al Maghazi and Nuseirat. The memo s instructions on the use of occupied territories says When possible avoid the term and be specific e.g. Gaza the West Bank etc. as each has a slightly different status. The United Nations along with much of the world considers Gaza the West Bank and East Jerusalem to be occupied Palestinian territories seized by Israel in the 1967 Arab Israeli war. The admonition against the use of the term occupied territories said a Times staffer obscures the reality of the conflict feeding into the U.S. and Israeli insistence that the conflict began on October 7.   You are basically taking the occupation out of the coverage which is the actual core of the conflict said the newsroom source. It s like Oh let s not say occupation because it might make it look like we re justifying a terrorist attack.

Citing warnings about catastrophic conditions in Gaza the court ordered Israel on January 26 2024 to take immediate and effective measures to enable the provision of urgently needed basic services and humanitarian aid and to report back on its compliance to the specific measures within one month.  One month later however Israel continues to obstruct the provision of basic services and the entry and distribution within Gaza of fuel and lifesaving aid acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes and include the use of starvation of civilians as a weapon of war. Fewer trucks have entered Gaza and fewer aid missions have been permitted to reach northern Gaza in the several weeks since the ruling than in the weeks preceding it according to United Nations Office of the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA.  The Israeli government is starving Gaza s 2.3 million Palestinians putting them in even more peril than before the World Court s binding order said Omar Shakir Israel and Palestine director at Human Rights Watch. The Israeli government has simply ignored the court s ruling and in some ways even intensified its repression including further blocking lifesaving aid.  Other countries should use all forms of leverage including sanctions and embargoes to press the Israeli government to comply with the court s binding orders in the genocide case Human Rights Watch said. Human Rights Watch found in December 2023 that Israeli authorities are using starvation as a weapon of war. Pursuant a policy set out by Israeli officials and carried out by Israeli forces the Israeli authorities are deliberately blocking the delivery of water food and fuel willfully impeding humanitarian assistance apparently razing agricultural areas and depriving the civilian population of objects indispensable to its survival. Israeli authorities have kept its supply of electricity for Gaza shut off since the October 7 Hamasled attacks. After initially cutting the entire supply of water that Israel provides to Gaza via three pipelines Israel resumed piping on two of its three lines. However due to the cuts and widespread destruction to water infrastructure amid unrelenting Israeli air and ground operations only one of those lines remained operational at only 47 percent capacity as of February 20. Officials at the Gaza Coastal Municipalities Water Utility told Human Rights Watch on February 20 that Israeli authorities have obstructed efforts to repair the water infrastructure. According to data published by OCHA and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNRWA the daily average number of trucks entering Gaza with food aid and medicine dropped by more than a third in the weeks following the ICJ ruling 93 trucks between January 27 and February 21 2024 compared to 147 trucks between January 1 and 26 and only 57 between February 9 and 21. A survey of impediments to the entry of aid faced by 24 humanitarian organizations operating in Gaza between January 26 and February 15 pointed to a lack of transparency around how aid trucks can enter Gaza delays and denials at Israeli crossings and inspection points and concerns about safety of trucks. By comparison an average of 500 trucks of food and goods entered Gaza each day before the escalation in hostilities in October during which time 1.2 million people in Gaza were estimated to be facing acute food insecurity and 80 percent of Gaza s population were reliant on humanitarian aid amid Israels more than 16yearlong unlawful closure.Highranking Israeli officials have articulated a policy to deprive civilians of food water and fuel as Human Rights Watch has documented. The Israeli government spokesperson said more recently that there are no limits to aid entering Gaza outside of security. Some Israeli officials blame the UN for distribution delays and accuse Hamas of diverting aid or Gaza police for failing to secure convoys. The Israeli government cannot shift blame to evade responsibility Human Rights Watch said. As the occupying power Israel is obliged to provide for the welfare of the occupied population and ensure that the humanitarian needs of Gaza s population are met. The Israeli human rights group Gisha challenged the Israeli government s claims that it is not obstructing entry or distribution of aid and also found that it is not complying with the ICJ order. Israeli authorities have also obstructed the aid that enters Gaza from reaching areas in the north. The survey of humanitarian organizations found that almost no aid is distributed beyond Rafah Gaza s southernmost governorate. On February 20 the World Food Programme paused deliveries of lifesaving food to the north citing lack of safety and security. Israeli forces struck a food convoy on February 5 the UN said and CNN documented. Between February 1 and 15 Israeli authorities only facilitated 2 of 21 planned missions to deliver fuel to the north of the Wadi Gaza area in central Gaza and none of the 16 planned fuel delivery or assessment missions to water and wastewater pumping stations in the north. Fewer than 20 percent of planned missions to deliver fuel and undertake assessments north of Wadi Gaza have been facilitated between January 1 and February 15 as compared with 86 percent of missions planned between October and December according to OCHA.  Israel s ground forces are able to reach all parts of Gaza so Israeli authorities clearly have the capacity to ensure that aid reaches all of Gaza Shakir said. Since the ICJ order Israeli authorities have also apparently destroyed the offices of at least two humanitarian organizations in Gaza and taken steps to undermine the work of UNRWA the largest provider of humanitarian aid in Gaza which more than half of other humanitarian organizations rely on to facilitate their operations. The head of UNWRA Philippe Lazarini said in a February 22 letter to the UN General Assembly president that the agency has reached a breaking point due to multiple government suspensions of funding and Israel s campaign to shut the agency down. Israel s finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said on February 13 that he had blocked a USfunded flour shipment to Gaza because it was going to UNRWA. Israel has alleged that at least 12 of the agency s 30000 employees participated in the October 7 attacks which the UN is investigating. In late December the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC a multipartner initiative that regularly publishes information on the scale and severity of food insecurity and malnutrition globally concluded that over 90 percent of Gaza s population is at crisis level of acute food insecurity or worse. The IPC said that virtually all Palestinians in Gaza are skipping meals every day while many adults go hungry so children can eat and that the population faced famine if current conditions persisted. This is the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified for any given area or country the group said. On February 19 The United Nations Children s Fund UNICEF found that 90 percent of children under age 2 and 95 percent of pregnant and breastfeeding women face severe food poverty. On February 22 Save the Children said families in Gaza are forced to forage for scraps of food left by rats and eating leaves out of desperation to survive noting that all 1.1 million children in Gaza are facing starvation.  In response to a request by South Africa for additional provisional measures following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s order for Israeli authorities to explore a possible plan to evacuate Rafah ahead of a ground incursion the ICJ said that the perilous situation demands immediate and effective implementation of the provisional measures throughout Gaza but not new measures and highlighted Israel s duty to ensure the safety and security of the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip.  Beyond enabling the provision of basic services and aid the measures in the ICJ s binding order require Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide. The ICJ issued these measures to protect the rights claimed by South Africa that the Court has found to be plausible including the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide. Although South Africa asked the court in its oral arguments during January hearings on the provisional measures to make any report it ordered public the court did not indicate that it has done so. Between January 26 and February 23 more than 3400 Palestinians were killed in Gaza according to figures from Gaza s Health Ministry compiled by OCHA. South Africa s case against Israel for genocide is distinct from the proceedings on the legal consequences of Israel s 57yearoccupation which began at the ICJ on February 19.  Israel s blatant disregard for the World Court s order poses a direct challenge to the rulesbased international order Shakir said. Failure to ensure Israel s compliance puts the lives of millions of Palestinians at risk and threatens to undermine the institutions charged with ensuring respect for international law and the system that ensures civilian protection worldwide.

https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/03/1147976,  UN Human Rights CouncilS rine Meradji Francesca Albanese Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories makes remarks at the 55th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. FacebookTwitterPrintEmail There are reasonable grounds to believe that Israel is committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territories said on Tuesday.  Francesca Albanese was speaking at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva where she presented her latest report entitled Anatomy of a Genocide during an interactive dialogue with Member States.  Following nearly six months of unrelenting Israeli assault on occupied Gaza it is my solemn duty to report on the worst of what humanity is capable of and to present my findings she said.   There are reasonable grounds to believe that the threshold indicating the commission of the crime of genocide has been met.  Citing international law Ms. Albanese explained that genocide is defined as a specific set of acts committed with the intent to destroy in whole or in part a national ethnic racial or religious group.   Specifically Israel has committed three acts of genocide with the requisite intent causing seriously serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part and imposing measures intended to prevent birth within the group she said.  Furthermore the genocide in Gaza is the most extreme stage of a longstanding settler colonial process of erasure of the native Palestinians she continued.   For over 76 years this process has oppressed the Palestinians as a people in every way imaginable crushing their inalienable right to selfdetermination demographically economically territorially culturally and politically.  She said the colonial amnesia of the West has condoned Israels colonial settler project adding that the world now sees the bitter fruit of the impunity afforded to Israel. This was a tragedy foretold.  Ms. Albanese said denial of the reality and the continuation of Israels impunity and exceptionalism is no longer viable especially in light of the binding UN Security Council resolution adopted on Monday which called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.   I implore Member States to abide by their obligations which start with imposing an arms embargo and sanctions on Israel and so ensure that the future does not continue to repeat itself she concluded.  Special Rapporteurs and independent experts like Ms. Albanese receive their mandates from the UN Human Rights Council. They are not UN staff and do not receive payment for their work.  Israel did not participate in the dialogue but issued a press release stating that it utterly rejects Ms. Albanese s report calling it an obscene inversion of reality .   The very attempt to level the charge of genocide against Israel is an outrageous distortion of the Genocide Convention. It is an attempt to empty the word genocide of its unique force and special meaning and turn the Convention itself into a tool of terrorists who have total disdain for life and for the law against those trying to defend against them the release said.  Israel said its war is against Hamas not Palestinian civilians.   This is a matter of explicit government policy military directives and procedures. It is no less an expression of Israel s core values. As stated our commitment to uphold the law including our obligations under international humanitarian law is unwavering.  The Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine to the UN in Geneva Ibrahim Khraishi noted that the report provides the historic context of genocide against the Palestinian people.  He said Israel continues its barbaric aggression and refuses to abide by the decision of the International Court of Justice ICJ issued in January to take provisional measures in order to prevent the crime of genocide. Israel has also refused to abide by UN General Assembly and Security Council resolutions including the one adopted on Monday he added.   And this means that all recommendations in the report of the Special Rapporteur shall be implemented and practical measures should be taken to prevent the export of weapons to boycott Israel commercially and politically and to implement mechanisms of accountability he said. Separately the UN Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada AlNashif presented a report on Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territory during the period from 1 November 2022 to 31 October 2023.  The reporting period has seen a drastic acceleration particularly after 7 October 2023 of longstanding trends of discrimination oppression and violence against Palestinians that accompany Israeli occupation and settlement expansion bringing the West Bank to the brink of catastrophe she said. There are now around 700000 Israeli settlers in the West Bank including East Jerusalem who live in 300 settlements and outposts all of which are illegal under international humanitarian law.  The size of existing Israeli settlements has also expanded markedly according to the report by the UN human rights office OHCHR. Approximately 24300 housing units within existing Israeli settlements in the West Bank in Area C were advanced or approved during the reporting period the highest on record since monitoring began in 2017.  The report observed that policies of the current Israeli Government appear aligned to an unprecedented extent with the goals of the Israeli settler movement to expand longterm control over the West Bank including East Jerusalem and to steadily integrate this occupied territory into the State of Israel Ms. AlNashif said. During the reporting period Israel took steps to transfer administrative powers relating to settlements and land administration from the military authorities to Israeli government offices whose primary focus is to provide services within the State of Israel.  The report therefore raises serious concerns that a series of measures including this transfer of powers to the Israeli civilian officials could facilitate the annexation of the West Bank in violation of international law including the Charter of the United Nations she said.  There was also a dramatic increase in the intensity severity and regularity of Israeli settler violence against Palestinians accelerating their displacement from their land in circumstances that may amount to forcible transfer.  The UN recorded 835 incidents of settler violence in the first nine months of 2023 the highest on record. Between 7 and 31 October 2023 the UN recorded 203 settler attacks against Palestinians and monitored the killing of eight Palestinians by settlers all by firearms.  Of the 203 settler attacks more than a third involved threats with firearms including shooting. Furthermore almost half of all incidents between 7 and 31 October involved Israeli forces escorting or actively supporting Israeli settlers while carrying out attacks.  Ms. AlNashif said the line between settler violence and State violence has further blurred including violence with the declared intent to forcibly transfer Palestinians from their land. She reported that in cases monitored by OHCHR settlers arrived masked armed and sometimes wearing the uniforms of Israeli security forces.   They destroyed Palestinians tents solar panels water pipes and tanks hurling insults and threatening that if Palestinians did not leave within 24 hours they would be killed she said. By the end of the reporting period Israeli security forces had reportedly handed out some 8000 weapons to socalled settlement defence squads and regional defence battalions in the West Bank she continued.   After 7 October the United Nations human rights office documented cases of settlers wearing full or partial Israeli army uniforms and carrying army rifles harassing and attacking Palestinians including shooting at them at pointblank range.  Israeli authorities also continued to implement eviction and demolition orders against Palestinians based on discriminatory planning policies laws and practices including on the grounds that properties lacked building permits. Ms. AlNashif said Israel demolished 917 Palestinianowned structures in the West Bank including 210 in East Jerusalem again one of the fastest rates on record. As a result more than 1000 Palestinians were displaced.   It is noteworthy that out of the 210 demolitions in East Jerusalem 89 were selfdemolitions by their owners to avoid paying fines from the Israeli authorities. This epitomizes the coercive environment that the Palestinians live in she said.  The human rights report also documented Israel s ongoing plan to double the settler population in the Syrian Golan by 2027 which is currently distributed among 35 different settlements. Beside settlement expansion commercial activity has been approved which she said may continue to limit the access of the Syrian population to land and water. The UN Security Council on Monday adopted a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in warravaged Gaza during Ramadan and calling for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/13/americas/guatemala-genocide-trial-maya-ixil-indigenous-intl-latam/index.html,  Ixil indigenous authorities attend a hearing where survivors of the civil war testify in the Ixil Genocide trial at the Supreme Court in Guatemala City Guatemala April 8 2024. Cristina ChiquinReuters CNN Juan Brito L pez was in his mid20s when soldiers rushed into his home in the village of Pexla nestled in Guatemala s western highlands. He escaped hiding in the wilderness but could not save his wife and four daughters.   Now 70 years old Brito L pez recounted the horrors of that day to High Risk Court A in Guatemala City this week saying the soldiers murdered his family during the early morning raid on January 20 1982 burning their bodies inside their wooden home.   Their deaths took place in the middle of Guatemala s 36yearlong civil war as a series of USbacked military governments cracked down on leftist rebels across the country. Guatemala s counterinsurgency campaign led to the death of over 200000 people 83 of whom were indigenous Maya according to a United Nationsbacked truth commission in 1999.   Decades later the bloodshed is being relived in the highprofile trial of the former head of Guatemala s army Manuel Benedicto Lucas Garc a in a monthslong process that is expected to see more than 150 witnesses 30 survivors of sexual violence and dozens of forensic experts give testimony.   According to Brito L pez and other witnesses who lived in the western Quiche region troops under the command of Lucas Garc a killed men women and children driving the indigenous Maya Ixil people who lived there away from their homes.   Retired General Benedicto Lucas Garcia 91 is seen on a screen during a video call from the ward of a military hospital where he is being held during his hearing at court in Guatemala City on April 5 2024. Johan OrdonezAFPGetty Images The former laborer who sometimes broke into tears during his testimony spoke in front of a large screen broadcasting Lucas Garc a s impassive figure. Lucas Garc a participated in the proceedings via video link from a military hospital.   The retired general has been indicted for genocide crimes against humanity forced disappearances and sexual violence against the Maya Ixil people according to the organization representing the victims the Association for Justice and Reconciliation AJR.   AJR accuses him of ordering more than 30 massacres and destroying 23 villages in the Maya Ixil region causing the death of at least 1771 people when he led the army between 1981 and 1982 during the tenure of his brother President Fernando Romeo Lucas Garc a.   The former general has denied the charges with one of his lawyers telling the court last week that Lucas Garc a will request an acquittal sentence with immediate freedom. CNN has attempted to contact his legal representation for comment.

The proceedings have stuttered over the years some producing groundbreaking results including the first time a Guatemalan head of state was put on trial. In 2018 a Guatemalan court ruled that the army committed acts of genocide but no one was convicted.   Human rights organizations and the Mayan victims of wartime massacres have been increasingly frustrated by the slow road to justice especially when the alleged perpetrators and their victims begin dying of old age.   Lucas Garc a 91 was meant to face trial this year with former military intelligence chief Manuel Callejas y Callejas. Both men were convicted in 2018 of aggravated sexual assault crimes against humanity and forced disappearances and given a 58year prison sentence. Callejas y Callejas was deemed unfit to stand in this current trial as he is suffering from dementia said Jes s Silvio acting president and legal representative of AJR told CNN.   The bloodshed during the civil war increased dramatically under President Romeo Lucas Garc a s regime 19781982 according to a report by Human Rights Data Analysis Group which saw what had been a selective campaign against guerrilla sympathizers turned into a mass slaughter.   Under his rule that is when the scorched earth campaign against indigenous communities of Guatemala really picked up JoMarie Burt a senior fellow at the Washington Office on Latin America who is an expert on human rights and transitional justice in Guatemala said. The period saw soldiers and paramilitary forces execute Mayan authorities tens of thousands of people were forcibly disappeared and entire villages were burned to the ground.   A UNbacked Commission for Historical Clarification CEH report found that between 1981 and 1983 a period when Lucas Garc a helmed the military the Guatemalan state committed acts of genocide against five Mayan groups including the Ixil people.   The army said it was countering a leftist insurgency but the report found the state deliberately magnified the military threat of the insurgency and in the majority of cases intentionally exaggerated the connection between the Mayan communities and the guerrillas.   Racism was a component behind the violence the report said as it also concluded that the undeniable existence of racism expressed repeatedly by the state as a doctrine of superiority explains the brutality with which military operations were carried out against hundreds of Mayan communities.   During the countrys ongoing civil war Guatemalan Army General Benedicto Lucas Garcia points to a map at a military garrison Santa Cruz de Quiche Guatemala January 19 1982. Robert NickelsbergArchive PhotosGetty Images Burt said this expression of racism is extremely profound and its knockon effects are evident in Guatemala today. During a separate genocide trial in 2013 which led to the conviction of dictator Efrain Rios Montt Burt who was observing the proceeding in person saw supporters of the general spray perfume on seats that had been sat on by indigenous people.   Today Guatemala s indigenous communities account for more than 40 of the country s population but their participation in public institutions and public life is certainly smaller in comparison to their size said Tiziano Breda a Latin American expert at the Armed Conflict Location Event Data Project of the deep inequalities that remain in Guatemala.   Infrastructure and services in areas mostly habited by the indigenous population are very dire and the fact there are 22 Mayan languages in the country and there are almost no signs in the capital in those languages are telling he added.   A million people became refugees due to the civil war and today inequality has made the Central American country one of the highest source countries for migrants encountered at the US borders many of whom come from rural areas largely populated by indigenous Guatemalans.   It took postconflict Guatemala years to build up capacity in its judicial system. Positive steps were made in the 2000 s with vital reforms and leadership by individuals like Claudia Paz y Paz who became attorney general from 20102014 and worked to break the tradition of impunity by criminal elements in the country Burt said.   International actors like the UNbacked International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala CICIG assisted in hundreds of convictions trained prosecutors and has been attributed for helping reduce the country s homicide rate.   But CICIG was dissolved in 2019 during a period of democratic backsliding in the country where successive Guatemalan governments and the country s elites have been accused of attempting to control the country s judiciary.   Dozens of prosecutors and judges fled the country. Those who remain have reported privately about receiving death threats say experts.   The system is coopted Silvio from AJR said. So this case has been delayed for 13 years and we still do not understand the reasons but this year they gave us the possibility.   Survivors from the civil war gather outside the Supreme Court prior to a hearing in the Ixil Genocide trial in Guatemala City Guatemala March 25 2024. Cristina ChiquinReuters The issue was not building a case but it was overcoming the fear of going after some of these people some of the most violent operators in Guatemala s military regime who maintain connections with armed actors and their own network of violent people Will Freeman Fellow for Latin America studies at the Council on Foreign Relations said.   CNN has reached out to Guatemala s prosecutor s office and department of justice for comment.   The country s current President Bernardo Ar valo an anticorruption figure who defied the odds and won the election last year in a landslide victory has promised to empower the judiciary. He has been constrained by the Public Ministry led by USsanctioned Attorney General Consuelo Porras that has made two requests to withdraw his immunity and is accused of attempting to disqualify the results of his election. Guatemala s Attorney General s office hasn t responded to CNN s multiple requests for response to this accusation.   The victims advocates hope the trial will bring a measure of accountability to those who perished during the war but time is running out said Michelle Liang who has been monitoring the trial as an international accompanier for the Network in Solidarity with the People of Guatemala NISGUA.   Lucas Garc a s team has been deploying tactics of delay to basically try to wait out the witnesses she said. They know that other witnesses are getting old and already more than 40 witnesses have passed away.   CNN has repeatedly attempted to reach out to his public defender and his private attorney.   When the trial was due to start at the end of March Lucas Garc a s lawyers announced their resignation.

What remains clear is the trauma of that period where he was too devastated to collect the remain of his family members. I couldn t stand the sadness he said. I fainted so others collected the ashes.   Another victim Catarina Chel told the court about the days she spent in the mountains in January of 1981.

The court adopted provisional measures or binding orders that include requiring Israel to prevent genocide against Palestinians in Gaza enable the provision of basic services and humanitarian assistance and prevent and punish incitement to commit genocide. The ICJ held hearings on January 11 and 12 to consider South Africa s request for provisional measures which featured the first formal response by Israel before an independent and impartial court to allegations of atrocities against the Palestinian people since October 7 2023. On December 29 2023 South Africa had filed a case with the court alleging that Israel is violating the 1948 Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.  The World Court s landmark decision puts Israel and its allies on notice that immediate action is needed to prevent genocide and further atrocities against Palestinians in Gaza said Balkees Jarrah associate international justice director at Human Rights Watch. Lives hang in the balance and governments need to urgently use their leverage to ensure that the order is enforced. The scale and gravity of civilian suffering in Gaza driven by Israeli war crimes demands nothing less.  The ICJ concluded it was necessary to indicate certain measures in order to protect the rights claimed by South Africa that the Court has found to be plausible including the right of the Palestinians in Gaza to be protected from acts of genocide. The court s order also requires Israel to prevent the destruction and ensure the preservation of evidence related to the case as well as to report on the implementation of the measures ordered within one month. The order is legally binding on the parties. Although South Africa had requested certain other measures in their application the court s rules allow the judges to determine what measures to order. The provisional measures order will be automatically sent to the UN Security Council. The case before the ICJ is not a criminal case against individual alleged perpetrators and it does not involve the International Criminal Court ICC a separate body. Rather the case is statetostate litigation between UN member states governed by legal provisions in the UN Charter the ICJ Statute and the Genocide Convention. ICC Prosecutor Karim Khan recently confirmed that his office has since March 2021 been conducting an investigation into alleged atrocity crimes committed in Gaza and the West Bank since 2014 and that his office has jurisdiction over crimes in the current hostilities between Israel and Palestinian armed groups that covers unlawful conduct by all parties.  The ICJ s speedy ruling is recognition of the dire situation in Gaza where civilians face starvation and are being killed daily at levels unprecedented in the recent history of Israel and Palestine Jarrah said. The court s clear and binding order raises the stakes for Israel s allies to back up their stated commitment to a global rulesbased order by helping ensure compliance with this watershed ruling.

In the 100 days that followed more than 800000 women men and children were murdered. Most were ethnic Tutsis some were Hutus and Twa people. It was a methodical mass extermination turning neighbor against neighbor and decades later its repercussions are still felt across Rwanda and around the world.  Today as Rwanda begins its annual Kwibuka period of remembrance the United States stands with the people of Rwanda in their grief. We honor the victims who died senselessly and the survivors who courageously rebuilt their lives. And we commend all Rwandans who have contributed to reconciliation and justice efforts striving to help their nation bind its wounds heal its trauma and build a foundation of peace and unity. Those efforts continue to this day.  We will never forget the horrors of those 100 days the pain and loss suffered by the people of Rwanda or the shared humanity that connects us all which hate can never overcome.

https://press.un.org/en/2024/gapal1465.doc.htm, GENEVA 3 April Division for Palestinian Rights Department of Political and Peacebuilding Affairs Israel s livestreamed genocide supported by many Western States must not go unpunished participants heard in Geneva today during the second day of the twoday Conference of Civil Society Organizations working on the Question of Palestine convened by the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People with speakers discussing best practices to ensure accountability and Israel s compliance with the rulings of the International Court of Justice. Ahmad Abuzneid Executive Director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights cited Washington D.C. as the greatest defender of genocide and apartheid in the world today continuing to arm defend and cover for Israel. Meanwhile thousands of people in the United States have committed acts of civil disobedience in the interest of Palestine with social media helping to shift the perspective. He spotlighted his organization s 2023 campaign Not On Our Dime which aims to remove charitable status from organizations providing funds to settler violence. Moreover he stressed that Israel must be isolated in every single avenue not just at the United Nations together with any nation standing with that country as it continues its genocidal assault. Rula Shadid Executive Director of the Palestine Institute for Public Diplomacy observed that amid ongoing genocide the narrative has been changing people are starting to comprehend better that this is a blockade a genocide a settlercolonial project with the main aim to displace Palestinians. On State responsibility she pointed out that numerous States that claim to be pioneers of the rule of law continue to be genocide supporters. In turn the situation has undermined liberties in European countries she said adding this is no longer just about Palestine but about democracy itself and the freedoms of expression and assembly. On justice and accountability for Palestine she highlighted grassrootslevel efforts urging States to end relations with Israel call for sanctions and impose arms embargos. Outlining the most effective solutions Diego Khamis Executive Director of the Palestinian Community in Chile underlined the need for a social and political majority supporting the legitimate claims of Palestinians. After 7 October Chile has consistently put pressure on Israel to respect international law and increased its support to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNRWA. Palestine is a cause that transcends Palestinians and is an ethical and moral duty of all societies now he asserted. In the ensuing discussion speakers underscored that Israel s treatment of Palestinians violates not only human rights but the sanctity of life itself. Accordingly they proposed the adoption of a standardized value of human life with a monetary value put on Palestinian lives and development and that Israel should be held responsible for providing compensation. In the second plenary meetings speakers focused on ensuring compliance with international mechanisms after the International Court of Justice rulings. Among them was Thembela Ngculu Counsellor at the South Africa Permanent Mission in Geneva who said that Israel s failure to comply with initial provisional measures and the worsening humanitarian situation in Gaza compelled South Africa to approach the International Court of Justice on 6 March to request further measures. On 28 March the Court called on Israel to take all necessary and effective measures to ensure the unhindered provision to all concerned of humanitarian and aid assistance to Palestinians throughout Gaza. Calling Israel an extension of European colonialism Ahmed Abofoul a Legal Expert at AlHaq said that South Africa s case before the International Court of Justice represents the Global South s impatience with Western hypocrisy. He criticized the West s relentless campaign of distorting international law to support their stance an example is the right to selfdefence. There is no doubt that an occupying Power does not have the right to selfdefence against the people it is occupying as those people according to international humanitarian law have the right to selfdefence. The West s complicity has made Gaza not only a graveyard of children but a graveyard of international law he asserted. On the UNRWA accusations he observed that Western democracies moved fast to suspend funding without waiting for evidence only to discover later that Israel was lying. Saleh Hijazi ApartheidFree Policy Coordinator Palestine BDS Committee said Israel s livestreamed and automated genocide supported by the United States Germany and other Western Powers could be the final blow to the international law system. And yet the right thing had been crystal clear from the outset sanctions. There must be an instant arms embargo and sanctions put in place as Israel has failed to comply with the International Court of Justice ruling. Also the General Assembly should hold an emergency session to expel Israel from the United Nations and reconvene the Special Committee against Apartheid he proposed. Bethany Ellis Watchlist Global Advocacy Adviser said that since 7 October 2023 over 13000 children were reportedly killed more than all those killed across the world in the Children and Armed Conflict Agenda from 20192022. In the coming weeks the SecretaryGeneral and the Special Representative on Children and Armed Conflict will finalize the 2023 report and make their decisions on the list of perpetrators. All Member States must stand up and demand that the list of perpetrators be complete a continued failure to list Israeli Government forces and Palestinian armed groups would undermine the Agenda s credibility she cautioned. Rounding out the discussion Ibrahim Khraishi Permanent Observer for the State of Palestine to the United Nations in Geneva underscored that the world has the responsibility to awaken its conscience and move to action . The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that ongoing hostilities in Gaza the destruction of roads and the prevalence of unexploded ordnance continue to pose significant risks for humanitarian workers. These challenges are also impeding the movement of aid supplies across the Gaza Strip. FacebookTwitterEmailPrintLinkedIn,
https://shprs.asu.edu/gaw2024, The 12th Rosenbluth Family Charitable Foundation Genocide Awareness Week is a series of lectures exhibits and storytelling by distinguished survivors scholars politicians activists artists humanitarians and members of law enforcement. This weeklong event seeks to address how we as a global society confront violent actions and current and ongoing threats of genocide throughout the world while also looking to the past for guidance and to honor those affected by genocide. This year s conference theme of nationalism state violence and genocide revolves around the role of the state in facilitating and shaping the perpetration of genocidal violence. By focusing on the genocidal state Genocide Awareness Week 2024 seeks to explore and examine different forms of authoritarian and exclusionary forms of nationalism how extremist form of national identity are constructed and maintained race and racial science cultural erasure religious nationalism and how mass violence is engineered and facilitated by genocidal states using technology and propaganda and other related topics. As in previous years our approach invites a range of academic experts activists survivors and governmental officials to provide presentations and discussions from a variety of perspectives. Our approach is also comparative in orientation with a range of historic and contemporary examples that highlight the underlying patterns processes and the continuities and discontinuities between different cases of genocide. These include the Holocaust the Armenian Genocide Rwanda and Bosnia among various other wellknown and lesserknown case studies. It is also intended that such a wideranging and comparative approach will help provide insights relevant to current events and trends at the local national and international levels.
