https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/4/20/us-legislators-banned-assault-weapons-in-94-why-cant-they-now, Washington DC Images of an attacker stalking a school workplace and other public areas while wielding a highpowered firearm have become common in the wake of mass shootings in the United States. The assault weapons often draw comparisons to combatants in war and they have become emblematic of what many say is an epidemic of gun violence in the country. Now as gun control advocates Democrats and US President Joe Biden push for a federal ban on assault weapons a similar decadesold prohibition looms large evidence to some that US lawmakers have the power to act to try to stem deadly shootings.  Ban assault weapons now. Once and for all Biden said in February in one of his many appeals to the US Congress since taking office.  I led the fight to do that in 1994. Let s finish the job and ban these assault weapons again.  Ban assault weapons.Require safe storage of firearms. Require background checks for all gun sales. Eliminate gun manufacturers immunity from liability.  Joe Biden JoeBiden April 17 2023  But observers question whether the decadesold ban which was passed in 1994 and expired 10 years later can be replicated especially as assault weapons have taken on a newfound political significance. In the years since the 1994 prohibition assault weapons increasingly became a political symbol among powerful segments of the gun community and Republican politicians said Robert Spitzer an expert on US gun policy. So while polls show there continues to be majority support for restriction on assault weapons in the US Spitzer told Al Jazeera the marketing of the weapon and its political implications have been viewed as kind of the front line of the American gun battle . In many ways the 1994 legislation represents a relic of the past. Passed with bipartisan support it came into force when such cooperation between the two major parties in US politics was generally more common said Gregg Lee Carter a professor of sociology at Bryant University and a gun violence and policy expert. Gun safety also had not completely evolved into the modern wedge issue it is today Carter told Al Jazeera as evidenced by the passage of a preceding 1993 law that mandated federal background checks for firearm purchases. Summing up his support for the 1994 ban thenRepublican Representative Henry Hyde a staunch conservative said They have no sporting use. They have no target use. Their only purpose is killing people and I don t see a justification for it.  Still the issue was fraught with former Representative Fred Upton recounting to the New York Times in 2019 When I voted for it I actually had to have police protection for six months It was really nasty.  The 1994 legislation was passed as part of an omnibus anticrime package that while controversial came amid concerns over the role highpowered firearms were playing in the US s crack cocaine epidemic in the 1980s and early 1990s Carter explained. By 2004 when the federal assault weapon ban expired the Democratic and Republican parties had already become more entrenched with Republicans hewing closer to progun interests. This was fuelled in part by pressure from the National Rifle Association NRA a gun lobby group whose political wing had become a more influential player despite weakening significantly in recent years. And aside from a relatively modest gun reform package passed last year with bipartisan support Carter said attempts to pass federal gun control legislation are consistently met with roadblocks from Republican legislators.  There s really been a cultural shift in the Republican Party he said. And there s just essentially no discussion.  Meanwhile the term assault weapon has no official definition under current US federal law and itself carries political baggage. For gun control advocates and analysts the term has generally been applied to certain highpowered semiautomatic rifles and pistols. Biden has most recently thrown his weight behind an assault weapons ban introduced by congressional Democrats in January which names 205 weapons that would be outlawed such as AK47style rifles semiautomatic rifles and AR15s while explicitly exempting 2200 other guns. That bill further defines assault weapons as rifles and pistols that have the capacity to use a detachable ammunition feeding device as well as having one or more particular features including a collapsable stock a pistol grip or a threaded barrel which can allow for certain attachments to be added. The 1994 legislation took a similar tact naming 19 firearm models explicitly while also giving a broad definition of the weapon. The 1994 legislation also barred the sale of highcapacity magazines which can be attached to firearms to allow a gunman to fire dozens of shots before reloading. The proposed 2023 ban includes this prohibition as well. The gun industry and influential lobby groups including the NRA have generally rejected that the assault weapon title applies to any guns currently being sold legally in the US. They have argued it only applies to fully automatic weapons which fire multiple rounds with a single pull of the trigger and were outlawed in the US in 1968 and not the semiautomatic firearms which fire only one bullet per trigger pull while automatically loading the next bullet that remain legal today. The focus on assault weapons and efforts to ban them at the federal level comes as these firearms have been disproportionately used in mass shootings compared with other categories of gun crimes according to The Violence Project a US nonprofit research group. The organisation which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people were killed in a public or semipublic location said what it classifies as assault weapons were used in 52 of the 189 such attacks since 1966. But they have been used in more highfatality incidents Seventeen of the 33 deadliest mass shootings in the US since 1966 were carried out with assault weapons the group s analysis showed. A separate count by Everytown for Gun Safety of mass shootings involving four or more victim fatalities regardless of where they took place found assault weapons had been used in nine of the 10 deadliest of those attacks between 2015 and 2022. The organisation recorded 175 mass shootings with four or more deaths during that period. The Violence Project s data also found that in the last 10 years the weapons were used in all seven mass attacks in which 14 or more people were killed a phenomenon experts attribute to the power of the weapons.  A ninemillimetre handgun is devastating but it can t hold a candle stick to the speed and the size of that .225 calibre bullet that comes out of an AR15 Carter said.  When it enters you the impact creates a reverberation that just turns the bone and the meat and the organs into hamburger.  While Biden continues to invoke the 1994 ban in an effort to get Congress to enact a new prohibition stressing that such a measure will help reduce gun violence experts say it remains difficult to determine what direct effect the decadesold law had on mass shootings. A 2019 study conducted by injury epidemiologists and trauma surgeons found that the risk of someone dying in a mass shooting was 70 percent lower when the 1994 ban was in place one of the report s authors trauma surgeon Michael Klein wrote in a recent article. The study noted however that the drop could not be definitively linked to the ban alone as it accompanied an overall reduction in crime attributable to several other possible factors. Andrew Morral the director of the National Collaborative on Gun Violence Research at the RAND Corporation which conducts regular reviews of gunrelated studies said there hasn t been research that says one way or the other whether the federal assault weapons ban or any state assault weapons bans have had their intended effect . Nine states and the District of Columbia have passed various measures that prohibit the sale or transfer of assault weapons but those bans only apply in those jurisdictions.  That s not to say they don t work. It just means that the research that s been done can t draw a conclusion on that question Morral told Al Jazeera adding however that there is limited evidence that bans on large capacity magazines may in fact reduce mass shootings . The circumstances surrounding mass shootings are difficult to study for several reasons. For one while such attacks are arrestingly more common in the US than in other developed countries they are still statistically rare. The Gun Violence Archive which employs one of the widest definitions of what constitutes a mass shooting tracked 513 mass shooting fatalities in 2020 a year when more than 45000 people died from gunrelated injuries. Yet regardless of the metric used almost all trackers show that the number of mass shootings has increased significantly since the 1994 ban expired. Morral also said that assault weapons have been disproportionately used in the highest casualty incidents in recent years.  And that suggests that they may be attractive to people who are intent on killing a large number of people for obvious reasons.  Another hurdle for US legislators today is the fact that assault rifles often marketed as modern sporting rifles have skyrocketed in popularity since the 1994 ban expired with at least 24 million in circulation as of 2022 according to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. Polling data from The Washington Post and Ipsos found that one in 20 US adults 16 million people owned at least one AR15style rifle as of 2023. That raises a difficult question over how effective a ban on new sales and manufacturing would be especially if it allowed residents to continue to own assault rifles bought before the ban went into effect as the 1994 ban did.  There are millions of these in circulation Bryant University s Carter said. The toothpaste is out of the tube.  At the same time the cultural embrace of these types of weapons among some Republicans puts a ban farther from reach from gun reform advocates Spitzer added. The style of weapon has become a common political token for legislators seeking to show their support for gun rights. In February Republican Representative Andrew Clyde touted that he was handing out lapel pins shaped like assault weapons to his House of Representatives colleagues. Republican Representative Barry Moore introduced legislation to make the AR15 style rifle the National Gun of the United States . And in the wake of a deadly school shooting in Nashville Tennessee in March the area s congressman Republican Andy Ogles also faced criticism for a Christmas photo showing him and his family holding assault rifles. That has had a knockon effect within the gun control community who may see measures like red flag laws expanded background checks or raising the minimum age for gun buyers as more politically attainable said Spitzer.  There s a sense that the prospect of enacting those types of laws is greater than enacting a new federal assault weapons ban he said.
https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/assault-weapons-large-magazines/, Second Amendment Firearms that gun control supporters call assault weapons and ammunition magazines that they call large are among the arms protected by the Second Amendment. Because they re among the arms that are most useful for the entire range of defensive purposes they re in common use for defensive purposes a standard articulated by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller 2008.8 This is true regardless of which of gun control supporters everexpanding definitions of assault weapons one uses.9 In 2015 Heller decision author Justice Antonin Scalia reiterated that the Second Amendment and Heller preclude assault weapons bans when he signed onto a dissent from the denial of certiorari in Friedman v. Highland Park.10 More assault weapons and large magazines less crime From 1991 when violent crime hit an alltime high to 2017 the nation s total violent crime rate decreased 47 percent including a 34 percent decrease in the murder rate.11 Meanwhile Americans bought about 200 million new firearms12 including more than eighteen million AR15s13 and so many tens of millions of large handgun and rifle magazines that it seems pointless to attempt a count.14 Different guns same old tune In the 1970s gun control supporters predicted that crime would rise unless Congress banned all handguns.15 In the 1980s they said the same thing about compact smallcaliber handguns.16 For a quartercentury they ve said the same thing about assault weapons and large magazines17 and RighttoCarry laws under which people carry semiautomatic handguns and large magazines for selfdefense.18Every one of these predictions has been proven false.19 Nevertheless they have expanded their definition of assault weapon to include virtually all semiautomatic shotguns and detachablemagazine semiautomatic rifles comparable handguns and various fixedmagazine rifles and continue to press for a ban on magazines.20 Study for Congress and followup studies The congressionallymandated study of the federal assault weapon and large magazine ban concluded that the banned guns were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders before the ban and the ban s 10round limit on new magazines wasn t a factor in multiplevictim or multiplewound crimes.21 A followup study concluded that AWs assault weapons and LCMs large capacity magazines were used in only a minority of gun crimes prior to the 1994 federal ban relatively few attacks involve more than 10 shots fired and the ban s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. 22 Another followup study found gunshot injury incidents involving pistols many of which use magazines that hold more than 10 rounds were less likely to produce a death than those involving revolvers which typically hold five or six rounds and the average number of wounds for pistol victims was actually lower than that for revolver victims. 23 In 2018 the RAND Corporation released a study that surveyed the available research on the effects of bans on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. The study found no conclusive evidence that such bans have an effect on mass shootings or violent crime.24 History of semiautomatic firearms Semiautomatic firearms were introduced in the 19th century. The first semiautomatic rifle was introduced in 1885 the first semiautomatic pistol in 1892 and the first semiautomatic shotgun in 1902.25 Semiautomatics account for 2025 percent of the approximately 400 million privatelyowned firearms in the United States today and the percentage is rising because semiautomatics account for over half of the 1015 million new firearms bought annually.26 Semiautomatics fire only one shot when the trigger is pulled like revolvers boltactions leveractions pumpactions doublebarrels and all other types of firearms except fullyautomatics machine guns.27 Thus semiautomatics cannot spray fire and they re not designed to be fired from the hip. 28 They aren t highpowered 29 there are no devices that convert them into machine guns legally30 they aren t equipped with grenade launchers and rocket launchers 31 and they certainly aren t weapons of mass destruction. 32 Origin of the issue The most popular semiautomatic firearm that gun control supporters call an assault weapon the AR15 was introduced in 1963 but gun control supporters didn t decide to call it and other semiautomatic firearms assault weapons until 1984.33 Gun control activists began campaigning against assault weapons only after they realized that their previous campaign to get handguns banned had failed.34 In 1988 an antihandgun activist group recommended to other such groups  Assault weapons . . . will . . . strengthen the handgun restriction lobby . . . . Handgun restriction consistently remains a nonissue with the vast majority of legislators the press and public. . . . Assault weapons . . . are a new topic. The weapons menacing looks coupled with the public s confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semiautomatic assault weapons anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. . . . Efforts to restrict assault weapons are more likely to succeed than those to restrict handguns.35  ATF 1989 importation ban The antihandgun group also recommended that the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF adopt guidelines to prohibit the importation of assault weapons. 36 The following year ATF banned the importation of 43 models of semiautomatic rifles that it had previously approved for importation.37  Because federal law requires ATF to approve the importation of any firearm that is particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes 38 the agency took the curious position that target shooting meant only organized marksmanship competition. Furthermore ATF ignored the portion of the law requiring approval of the importation of firearms that are readily adaptable to sporting purposes.  In 1998 ATF expanded its ban to include any semiautomatic rifle capable of using a detachable magazine that could hold more than 10 rounds.39 Gun control supporters periodically insist that the importation restrictions be tightened.40 California s and New Jersey s bans California banned assault weapons in 1989 and New Jersey banned assault firearms in 1990. New Jersey s ban included the Marlin Model 60 .22 caliber squirrel rifle which an antigun New Jersey politician called a peoplekilling machine. Both states allowed owners to register and keep banned guns already owned but only about 10 percent of owners complied with the registration requirements.41 Several other states subsequently banned assault weapons assault pistols andor large magazines.42 Clinton assault weapon ban President Bill Clinton campaigned for a federal assault weapon and large magazine ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein DCalif. saying people can t be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans. 43 Crime reports and felon surveys showed that assault weapons were used in only 12 percent of violent crimes and in the 10 preceding years murders committed without guns outnumbered those with assault weapons by about 37to1.44 Nevertheless the ClintonFeinstein ban on new manufacture of assault weapons and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds was imposed from 1994 to 2004.  Pushing for an expanded ban As the scheduled 2004 expiration of the ban approached gun control supporters campaigned to have the ban not only extended but also expanded the Brady Campaign calling California s ban the model for the nation. 45 But because assault weapons are used in only a tiny percentage of murders California s murder rate increased every year for five years after its 1989 ban 26 percent overall while in the rest of the country murder increased 10 percent. During the first five years after California expanded its ban in 2000 the state s murder rate increased 10 percent compared to a five percent decrease in the rest of country.46 Nevertheless in 2013 Feinstein introduced a ban much more restrictive than the one in effect between 1994 and 2004.47 Whereas her 1994 ban merely prohibited manufacturing or assembling one of the targeted firearms with its full complement of standard external attachments her 2013 bill would have banned the manufacture of the same firearms altogether as well as banned the manufacture of other firearms not addressed in the 1994 legislation. Her 2013 bill would have banned the manufacture of any semiautomatic shotgun or detachablemagazine semiautomatic rifle that had any characteristic that can function as a grip as well as various fixed magazine rifles and selfdefense handguns and prohibit anyone from selling or otherwise transferring a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Million Mom March have proposed that pumpaction firearms be banned as assault weapons too.48 Semiautomatic rifles like the AR15 are the most popular rifles in the United States for home protection and defensive skillsbased firearm training and marksmanship competitions49 and they re increasingly popular among hunters.50 Ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are standard equipment for many handguns and rifles designed for defensive purposes they re commonly used in handguns kept for protection at home and carried for protection away from home and they re commonly used in defensive skillsbased firearm training and sports.51  1 Roth Koper et al.

The Court said that the inherent right of selfdefense has been central to the Second Amendment right which is the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation including all instruments that constitute bearable arms. It struck down D.C. s handgun ban saying the handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of arms that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for the lawful purpose of selfdefense. Explaining its deference to the firearm preferences of the American people the Court cited its decision in U.S. v. Miller 1939 that the Second Amendment protects the right to arms that have a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia and citing the decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court in Aymette v. State 1840 arms that are part of the ordinary military equipment andor that could be used to contribute to the common defense. The Miller Court said that citizens called into militia service were traditionally expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.  9 Gun control supporters have tried to add more types of firearms to their lists of guns they want banned as assault weapons. For example the federal assault weapon and large magazine ban of 19942004 authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein DCalif. defined assault weapons to include detachablemagazine semiautomatic rifles having two or more external attachments named in the law and comparable shotguns and handguns. But in 2013 Feinstein proposed S. 150 which because of the bill s definition of pistol grip would have banned firearms regardless of their number of external attachments as well as certain fixedmagazine semiautomatic rifles. Other gun control supporters have proposed that pumpaction shotguns and pumpaction rifles be banned as assault weapons too.

https://www.lwv.org/blog/assault-weapons-what-their-legality-and-impact, Assault weapons are firearms that can fire more and deadlier rounds over a shorter period than a handgun. Research suggests that banning assault weapons can prevent mass shooting injuries and deaths. While some states have their own assault weapons bans federal legislation is needed to address this issue nationwide.  A semiautomatic weapon is a firearm that with each pull of the trigger fires one bullet and automatically loads another allowing it to fire quickly. It fires bullets with more energy than a handgun resulting in more damage to the human body.  A magazine is a device that feeds ammunition into a firearm and a large or highcapacity magazine typically refers to one that holds more than 10 or 15 rounds of ammunition allowing a shooter to fire many bullets before needing to reload.

The definition of an assault weapon varies under federal and state laws but generally refers to a semiautomatic weapon sometimes with one or two specific militarystyle features. Compared to a handgun an assault weapon with a fixed or detachable largecapacity magazine can fire more and deadlier rounds over a short period.  In 1993 the US Senate passed an omnibus crime bill with a near unanimous vote of 954. It included the subsection of the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act commonly known as the Federal Assault Weapons Ban. The ban prohibited the manufacture transfer or possession of certain semiautomatic assault weapons. It also banned the transfer or possession of largecapacity magazines that held more than 10 rounds.  In 1994 a bipartisan group of former presidents Gerald Ford R Jimmy Carter D and Ronald Reagan R sent a letter to House members urging them to pass the omnibus bill which they did later that year. It went into law as the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.  The 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban had several limitations  The ban also had a sunset provision specifying that it would expire in 10 years unless Congress reauthorized it. In 2004 the US House of Representatives introduced a bill to extend the ban for another decade but it did not go to a vote. On September 13 2004 the ban expired and assault weapons and largecapacity magazines became legalized unless prohibited by state or local laws.  As of 2023 10 states CA CT DE HI IL MA MD NJ NY and WA and the District of Columbia have laws banning the manufacture sale and transfer of assault weapons. Some additionally prohibit their possession. Fourteen states and DC ban largecapacity magazines. This piecemeal legislative landscape has been insufficient to address the dangers of assault weapons across the country.  In mass shootings the number of people shot is six times higher when an assault weapon is involved and five times higher when a largecapacity magazine is involved. In an analysis assault weapons accounted for more than 85 of deaths in mass shootings.  While it is hard to measure the full impact of the 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban banning assault weapons can prevent mass shooting injuries and deaths. When the federal ban was in effect mass shooting fatalities were 70 less likely compared to before and after the ban. This type of regulation has popular support nationwide as 67 of Americans support banning assault weapons and highcapacity magazines.  In the 117th Congress in 2022 the US House of Representatives passed with bipartisan support an assault weapons ban to renew and strengthen the previous ban. The Senate however did not move it.  In the current 118th Congress both chambers have legislation S. 25H.R. 698 that would ban the importation manufacture transfer sale or possession of a semiautomatic weapon or largecapacity ammunition feeding device except those lawfully possessed before the ban is enacted.  The League of Women Voters of the United States believes that the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons in the US is a major health and safety threat to its citizens and supports strong federal measures to limit the accessibility and regulate the ownership of these weapons by private citizens. The League advocated including the assault weapons ban in the Omnibus Crime Bill in 1994 and its extension in 2004. In 2022 LWVUS submitted testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee on gun safety reform including banning assault weapons and placing limits on the size of ammunitionfeeding devices.  PORTLAND WASHINGTON The League of Women Voters of Maine and the League of Women Voters of the United States issued this statement following the acts of violence and active shooter situation in Lewiston.  The League of Women Voters of the United States submitted comments to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF regarding its proposed rulemaking on the definition of when a person is considered engaged in the business as a dealer in firearms. On June 23 the Supreme Court of the United States handed down its decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen overturning a New York gun safety law. The Court ruled that New York s law requiring a license to carry concealed weapons in public places is unconstitutional.   2022 League of Women Voters. All Rights Reserved.

Assault weapons with largecapacity magazines have become the weapon of choice for assailants seeking to perpetrate mass casualty attacks for a reason. These uniquely dangerous firearms are equipped with features that facilitate mass shootings and must be regulated accordingly.  Assault weapons especially assault rifles are typically semiautomatic versions of weapons created for deadly battlefield purposes. They are designed and equipped with features that enable mass killing including sustained highvolume rapid fire shooting at large numbers of people in a short period of time. The availability of unusually dangerous weaponry like assault weapons and largecapacity magazines has fueled an alarming increase in high casualty mass shootings across the nation. Perpetrators of many of the deadliest shootings in modern American history including in Las Vegas Orlando Sandy Hook Elementary School Sutherland Springs El Paso Robb Elementary School Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Aurora and Dayton used assault weapons equipped with largecapacity magazines. These unusually dangerous weapons also expose law enforcement officers to heightened risk from gunmen wielding increasingly highpowered combat grade weapons on civilian streets.  In the absence of federal legislation regulating assault weapons states must take it upon themselves to protect their residents from mass shootings by regulating or banning the sale and manufacture of these uniquely dangerous weapons. Assault weapons are typically a subset of semiautomatic firearms with features designed to enable shooters to repeatedly fire at large numbers of people quickly. They are a relatively new class of weapon during the 1980s the gun industry sought to reverse a decline in consumer demand for guns by developing and marketing new types of weapons based on highpowered military designs.1 Between 1994 and 2004 a relatively narrow federal assault weapons law placed some restrictions on the sale and manufacture of some semiautomatic assault weapons. This federal law expired in 2004. Though the US House of Representatives passed legislation in 2022 to renew and strengthen this assault weapons law that legislation has not passed the US Senate and there is currently no federal law restricting the sale manufacture or possession of assault weapons.  Wounds caused by assault weapons are more severe and lethal than wounds caused by other firearms and particularly when paired with large capacity magazines assault weapons can injure more people more quickly.  A growing body of research demonstrates that banning assault weapons can help to prevent gun violence and mass shootings in particular. Studies of both the lapsed federal assault weapons ban and statelevel assault weapons bans show that these laws help to reduce fatalities and injuries from mass shootings as well as the use of assault weapons in crime. The American public strongly supports efforts to better regulate assault weapons. 67 of Americans including half of all Republicans support a ban on assault weapons.7 In 1994 Congress adopted the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 which made it generally unlawful for a person to manufacture transfer or possess a semiautomatic assault weapon.8 The law was adopted with a sunset clause however and expired in 2004 despite overwhelming public support for its renewal. Thus semiautomatic military style weapons that were formerly regulated under federal law are now legal unless banned by state or local law. The 1994 act defined the phrase semiautomatic assault weapon to include 19 named firearms and copies of those firearms as well as certain semiautomatic rifles pistols and shotguns with at least two specified characteristics from a list of features.9 The full semiautomatic assault weapon definition from the 1994 act is available here. The federal ban also prohibited the transfer and possession of any new large capacity ammunition magazine.10 Additional information is available in our summary on Large Capacity Magazines. Charles DiMaggio et al. Changes in US Mass Shooting Deaths Associated with the 1994 2004 Federal Assault Weapons Ban Analysis of Open source Data Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery 86 no. 1 2019 11 19. As described above studies show that the federal assault weapons ban resulted in a marked decrease in the use of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines in crime.  The 1994 act did suffer from notable limitations however. The relatively weak twofeature test and the inclusion of some purely cosmetic features created a loophole that allowed manufacturers to successfully circumvent the law by making minor modifications to weapons they already produced. The law also did not prohibit the continued transfer or possession of assault weapons manufactured before the law s effective date. Manufacturers took advantage of this loophole by boosting production of assault weapons in the months leading up to the ban creating a legal stockpile of these guns. Federal law prohibits any person from importing a firearm unless authorized by the US attorney general.11 The attorney general must authorize the importation of any firearm that is generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes excluding surplus military firearms. 12 Federal law also prohibits any person from assembling from imported parts any semiautomatic rifle or any shotgun which is identical to any rifle or shotgun prohibited from importation.13 In 1998 ATF announced that semiautomatic rifles capable of accepting large capacity ammunition magazines are not generally recognized as particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes and are therefore not importable. 14 However a 2011 report by three US Senators found that Since the Clinton Administration s efforts the Gun Control Act of 1968 s prohibition against nonsporting firearms has not been aggressively enforced and many militarystyle nonsporting rifles have flowed into the United States civilian market. 15 Ten states California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey New York and Washington as well as the District of Columbia have enacted laws that generally ban the sale manufacture and transfer of assault weapons. Two other states Minnesota and Virginia have also enacted laws that place some additional safety requirements and regulations on assault weapons though these regulations fall far short of the general ban on the sale and manufacture of assault weapons enacted in the other nine states above. The earliest assault weapon restrictions were enacted in the District of Columbia as part of a 1932 federal law with the remaining nine states first adopting legislation to prohibit assault weapons later in the 20th century starting with California.16 While many state assault weapon laws are broadly similar there are significant differences regarding  Some state laws regulating assault weapons have used much stronger definitions of assault weapon than others applying these safety protections and restrictions to a broader subset of firearms.  Some have defined firearms as restricted assault weapons by referencing a list of specific named firearm models and weapons that are determined to be duplicates or copycats of those named firearm models.  Some states have either additionally or instead used a characteristics or features test that designates firearms as restricted assault weapons if they combine a certain number of features that make the firearm most useful for assaultive purposes including features that provide highvolume firing capacity enhanced control when the firearm is rapidly repeatedly fired enhanced weapon concealability and other features such as flash suppressors and grenade launchers that may be indicative of assaultive purposes. For example many state assault weapon laws state that the definition of restricted assault weapon includes semiautomatic rifles that have a fixed magazine capable of accepting more than 10 rounds of ammunition or semiautomatic rifles that combine the ability to accept detachable magazines with at least one other assaultive feature. Some of the narrower and weaker state assault weapons laws define firearms as assault weapons only if they combine a larger number of these assaultive features. A onefeature test includes more assault weapons and helps prevent the gun industry from skirting the law by selling very slightly modified versions of banned weapons. Assault weapons bans vary in what conduct is regulated. Some state laws like California broadly restrict sale offer for sale manufacture distribution importation transportation and keeping or offering for sale of assault weapons. The strongest laws also generally prohibit possession of assault weapons too including strong regulation of legacy weapons acquired before the assault weapon law was enacted. For example California and Illinois generally require people who owned legacy assault weapons prior the assault weapons law s enactment to record or register their weapon with state law enforcement and possess that weapon only in specified locations or circumstances on private property at shooting ranges or while engaged in lawful hunting activity. Based on data compiled by Giffords Law Center. Last updated July 2020. Assault weapons bans differ in their treatment of legacy weapons obtained prior to the date the assault weapons law took effect. Only Washington State does not impose any general qualifications on the possession of preban assault weapons though the state does require safety training and a minimum age of 21 for purchase of any semiautomatic rifle. The District of Columbia does not allow for possession of preban legacy weapons. Every other state with a ban has legacy provisions that exempt at least some preban weapons meaning that individuals who possessed prohibited assault weapons prior to the ban may generally keep them provided that certain requirements are met. California Connecticut Hawaii Illinois New Jersey and New York for example required the owners of legacy weapons to submit forms or other notification to law enforcement registering their ownership of such legacy weapons.33 New Jersey s treatment of preban weapons was particularly strong because only assault weapons with a legitimate targetshooting purpose could be registered effectively requiring over 60 models types and series of assault weapons to be transferred out of state rendered inoperable or surrendered to law enforcement. Maryland required registration of legacy assault pistols but not assault long guns. See our summary on the Registration of firearms for further information about registration systems. California Connecticut Hawaii Illinois Maryland and New York prohibit transfer of all or most legacy weapons owned prior to the adoption of a ban. California Connecticut and Delaware limit the places where a legacy weapon may be possessed.34 In Massachusetts and New Jersey legacy weapons may only be sold and possessed if the owner has a license. Additional information on licensing of firearm owners is contained in our summary on Licensing. Gun violence is a complex problem and while there s no onesizefitsall solution we must act. Our reports bring you the latest cuttingedge research and analysis about strategies to end our country s gun violence crisis at every level. Minnesota prohibits the possession of semiautomatic militarystyle assault weapons by persons under 18 years of age as well as other prohibited persons and imposes additional restrictions on transfers through firearms dealers. As of August 1 2023 Minnesota will require semiautomatic militarystyle assault weapon purchasers to obtain a transferee permit unless the purchaser is purchasing from or transacting the sale through a federally licensed dealer.35 A concealed carry permit constitutes a transferee permit for the purpose of purchasing an assault weapon.36 Virginia limits the knowing and intentional possession and transportation of certain semiautomatic assault firearms to citizens and permanent residents age 18 and older. These weapons may not be carried loaded in public places in certain cities and counties. Virginia also imposes a general ban on the importation sale possession and transfer of the Striker 12 and semiautomatic folding stock shotguns of like kind but does not refer to them as assault firearms.  Adopted by Cook County Illinois in 1993 the Blair Holt Assault Weapons Ban prohibits the manufacture sale transfer or possession of an assault weapon or large capacity magazines in Cook County Illinois. The Ban was adopted in 1993 but was amended and renamed in memory of Blair Holt a 16yearold boy who was shot and killed as a bystander when gang violence erupted on a bus in 2007. The law includes an extensive list of prohibited assault weapon types models and series and provides a onefeature test identifying other rifles shotguns and pistols as assault weapons. The law defines a large capacity magazine as any ammunition feeding device with the capacity to accept more than ten rounds. The 1993 ordinance enacting this law provided that any person who was legally in possession of an assault weapon or large capacity magazine at that time had 90 days to 1 remove it from the county 2 modify it so it was rendered either inoperable or so changed that it would fall outside the definition of assault weapon or large capacity magazine or 3 surrender it to law enforcement. Only law enforcement officers and members of the military are now allowed to possess assault weapons or large capacity magazines in the county.37 Assault weapons bans have been upheld again and again over the years in both state and federal courts.38 The US Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized the nation s clear historical tradition of prohibiting the carrying of dangerous and unusual weapons for the purpose of protecting public safety.39 The Court indicated that bans on dangerous and unusual weapons that are most useful in military service are presumptively lawful regulatory measures 40 and emphasized that in our nation s historical record from Blackstone through the 19thcentury cases commentators and courts routinely explained that the Second Amendment right was not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. 41 Restrictions on uniquely dangerous weaponry like assault weapons do not substantially burden individuals right or ability to defend themselves with a firearm. Instead they reduce shooters capacity to inflict mass murder and to chill the exercise of other fundamental rights. We re in this together.

If it insults the Constitution so be it any other response would do far greater harm to our freedoms. Or we could argue for a while and then do nothing. We ve tried that course of action many times and it doesn t work. An Islamic State sympathizer was able to go into a gun store days or weeks ago and buy both a pistol and an AR15style semiautomatic assault rifle which he used to kill 49 men and women at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando. Had he been armed with the pistol alone he still would have killed people but not so many. Keeping militarygrade combat weapons out of the hands of maniacs should not be a controversial idea. The Second Amendment enshrines the right to keep and bear arms and the Supreme Court has ruled that this is an individual right not a collective one. The court has made clear however that this does not preclude reasonable gun control measures. Not all weapons must be considered suitable for private hands. When the framers wrote of arms they were thinking about muskets and singleshot pistols. They could not have foreseen modern rifles or highcapacity magazines. They lived at a time when it was impossible to imagine one man barging into a crowded room and killing more than one or two people before having to reload and surely being subdued. Today it is not only imaginable but also tragically commonplace. No hunter needs an AR15 to bring down a deer. None of us needs such a weapon to defend our families against intruders. And for those who believe assault rifles offer protection against a hypothetical tyrannical government or who perhaps consider the present government tyrannical I have sobering news If and when the black helicopters come they will be accompanied by tanks. Why focus exclusively on the guns? Because other proposed solutions would violate the letter and spirit of the Constitution and surely wouldn t work anyway. One of the presidential candidates I don t want to sully this column with his name has suggested a ban on Muslim immigration. The idea would be laughable if it were not so dangerously unAmerican. Which would be impossible of course. I suppose immigration officers could ask every foreign visitor whether he or she is a Muslim but then what? If the answer is no wave them through? Stop them for further questioning if they look Muslim whatever that means? Don t you think Islamic State operatives might be smart enough to have Bibles in their carryons rather than Korans? Attempting such a prohibition would also be obscene in a nation that enshrines religious freedom in the First Amendment. Enough said about this loathsome idea. Another possible response would involve more vigilant surveillance. The Orlando shooter had been interviewed by the FBI at least twice because of alleged extremist leanings or connections. He was apparently on a terrorism watch list for a time but was removed after authorities decided there was no need to keep him under suspicion. By all means Congress should immediately ban gun sales to anyone on such a watch list. But that wouldn t have helped in Orlando. No level of surveillance remotely permissible under the Constitution would allow authorities to detect all instances of selfradicalization and act on them. We put people in jail for what they do not what they think. Should there be universal background checks for gun purchases? Yes of course. But the Orlando killer passed a background check. It is not possible to have a free society without the presumption of innocence. Freedom is possible however without the right to buy military weapons designed for killing sprees. Banning them would not end mass killings but it would mean fewer deaths. If we do not act the blood of future victims will be on all of our hands.
