https://www.aclu.org/news/racial-justice/why-access-to-education-is-key-to-systemic-equality, All students have a right to an equal education but students of color particularly Black and Brown students and students with disabilities have historically been marginalized and criminalized by the public school system. The ACLU has been working to challenge unconstitutional disciplinary policies in schools combat classroom censorship efforts that disproportionately impact marginalized students and support race conscious admission policies to increase access to higher education. Let s break down why education equity is critical to the fight for systemic equality. Education equity means all students have equal access to a high quality education safe learning environment and a diverse student body that enriches the educational experiences of all students. As the Supreme Court said in Brown v. Board of Education education is the very foundation of good citizenship. Through education young people learn important values about our culture and democratic society and about their own values and relationships to others in this society. In addition to being an important foundation for kids and young adults future professional success education allows individuals to be informed voters and participants in democratic processes and public education is the first experience most people will have with the government. For all of these reasons equity in education is a critical foundation for a democratic society in which people of all backgrounds are equally included. Without equal opportunities to obtain an education they will not be able to participate equally in jobs in voting and in other crucial areas of life. And when students are not able to learn together this harms their ability to work together and live and engage with one another later in life. Modern understandings of educational equity have their roots in Brown v. Board of Education the 1954 landmark Supreme Court decision that ordered an end to school segregation and held racial segregation in education violates the Equal Protection Clause of the constitution. The ACLU played an important role in the Brown litigation and has continued to fight for education equity on many fronts in the decades since. The schooltoprison pipeline refers to school discipline practices such as suspensions and referrals to law enforcement that funnel youth out of the classroom and into the juvenile and criminal legal systems. This trend reflects our country s prioritization of incarceration over education and it s made worse as resources for public schools are cut. From inadequate resources for counseling to an overreliance on schoolbased police officers to enforce harsh zerotolerance policies many students overwhelmingly students of color and students with disabilities are isolated punished and pushed out of our education system for typical childish behavior and behaviors associated with disabilities. How the lack of school mental health staff is harming students. Even a single suspension or disciplinary infraction can have enormous consequences for a child s education. As a student is pushed further down the schooltoprison pipeline those consequences escalate quickly. In some jurisdictions students who have been suspended or expelled have no right to an education at all. In others they are sent to disciplinary alternative schools.Youth who become involved in the juvenile system are often denied procedural protections in the courts and students pushed along the pipeline find themselves in juvenile detention facilities many of which provide few if any educational services. Black and Brown students and students with disabilities are disproportionately subjected to discipline and referrals to law enforcement that remove them from the classroom and subject them to additional punitive consequences and even physical injury. For example over the 20172018 school year Black students accounted for 28.7 percent of all students referred to law enforcement and 31.6 percent of all students arrested at school or during a schoolrelated activity despite representing just 15.1 percent of the total enrolled student population. Our country s schools are increasingly diverse but also increasingly segregated. Students of all races are harmed by the inability to learn with one another in diverse school settings. Black and Latine students are also more likely to attend schools that are intensely segregated both by race and by socioeconomic status. Students of color are also less likely to have access to advanced courses and are frequently tracked away from college preparatory courses when they do exist. The work to ensure educational opportunities for people of color continues despite the court s decision. Inequities in K12 education can be replicated in college and university admissions criteria. As with elementary and secondary schools colleges and universities are required to ensure that educational opportunities are open to all students from the application stage and through student s experiences during their college education. There are a wide range of things that colleges and universities can do to ensure that educational opportunities are open to people of all backgrounds. There are a range of evidencebased methods schools can use to respond to the behavioral needs of students. These range from strategies that teachers and schools can use to foster a positive learning culture and model to interventions addressing particular disciplinary issues such as conflict deescalation or restorative justice to using functional behavioral assessments and wraparound support for those students with higher levels of need. Additionally schools that employed more mental health providers saw improved student engagement and graduation rates. Schools that used other types of support including restorative and traumainformed practices saw beneficial results including reduced disciplinary incidents suspensions dropouts and expulsions. Investing in mental health resources support personnel and interventions that promote positive student interactions can make schools safer and healthier learning environments while also helping to combat the discriminatory schooltoprison pipeline that targets students of color and students with disabilities. Instruction about racism and sexism belongs in schools because it equips students to process the world around them and to live in a multicultural society. Attacks on education have morphed from demands to exclude critical race theory from classrooms to everincreasingly devious and dangerous demands to erase entire concepts from American history. Book bans socalled transparency laws designed to intimidate educators into compliance and attacks on individual expression have left our education system at the mercy of a hostile and discriminatory minority. Students can t learn in that type of environment. Our future depends on educational institutions that value instruction about systemic racism and sexism. We need to expand culturally relevant instruction and increase funding for diversity equity and inclusion in schools not attack it for its role in uplifting the systematically oppressed. Affirmative action in college admissions has been an important tool but it is not the only avenue for ensuring that educational opportunities are open to all. In the absence of affirmative action it is more important than ever that schools work to identify and remove inequitable barriers to higher education. At a minimum schools must continue to comply with federal and state civil rights laws that require them to provide educational opportunities on an equal basis. They can achieve this by ensuring that policies and practices do not unnecessarily limit opportunities for people on the basis of race or ethnicity or other protected characteristics including disability sex sexual orientation and gender identity and by ensuring that school climate enables all students to access and engage with educational opportunities. The ACLU and our affiliates around the country are challenging disciplinary policies that disparately target students of color and students with disabilities and infringe on their right to a safe learning environment. This includes litigation such as our recent victory resulting in the end to charging students with disorderly conduct or disturbing schools in South Carolina schools and advocacy such as the ACLU of Idaho s recent report Proud to be Brown and the related civil rights complaint. The report documents how school districts in Idaho are jeopardizing Latine students civil rights and liberties by enforcing gang dress codes that target mostly Latine students in a discriminatory way and have negative consequences on their cultural identity discipline and education. The ACLU Union filed a federal lawsuit challenging South Carolina s disturbing schools law.  We are also fighting back against efforts to ban books and restrict what students can learn about race gender and sexual orientation. In Florida for example we re challenging the state s harmful Stop WOKE Act. We continue to press for equity in higher education following the Supreme Court s ruling on affirmative action and defend against attacks on diversity in K12 schools. From K12 to higher education the ACLU is working to combat discrimination in education and ensure all people have equal access to safe quality education.
https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/half-of-americans-dont-think-schools-should-teach-about-racisms-impact-today/2022/02, And as debates over how children learn about sensitive subjects bubble up across the country Americans are also split on whether parents or teachers should have a great deal of influence over what is taught in schools the survey shows. Republicans tend to defer to parents of schoolchildren while Democrats tend to think teachers should get to decide how to teach about certain issues.  These results suggest that not only are we divided about what s the best curriculum but we re also divided about who gets to figure that out and who gets to decide said Eric Plutzer a professor of political science and sociology at Pennsylvania State University who coauthored the report. That makes it hard to solve a problem if we can t even agree on the process and it suggests that these kinds of issues are going to continue to come up at the local level and we won t be able to solve by consensus.    The nationally representative survey of 1200 U.S. adults conducted in early December was designed by the McCourtney Institute for Democracy at Penn State and analyzed by the American Public Media Research Lab. The goal was to understand how Americans think three controversial subjects should be taught in school slavery and race evolution and sexual education.  While most Americans think schools have a responsibility to teach about slavery only about half think schools should teach about the ongoing effects of racism. However responses differed when separated by race 79 percent of Black Americans think that students should learn about the ongoing impacts of slavery and racism while 48 percent of white Americans think schools should teach about historical slavery but not contemporary race relations.  The survey also found that 10 percent of Americans don t think that schools have a responsibility to ensure that all students learn about the history of slavery and racism in the United States.   It s hard to know exactly what s in the minds of those people but it seems to be consistent with the idea that increasing numbers of Americans want to remove from our curriculum anything that somehow reflects poorly on the United States as a country or their state and that it s unpleasant to think about slavery and its legacy and they d rather it not be taught at all Plutzer said.  Plutzer said he sees similarities between these findings and some of the recent controversies over how schools teach the Holocaust. A Tennessee school district for instance removed the graphic novel Maus from its 8th grade curriculum because of the school board s objections to the book s profanity and nudity. There s a desire among some Americans to gloss over the violence and horrors that happened in both slavery and the Holocaust Plutzer said to teach slaverylite or Holocaustlite.  When asked how much influence different stakeholders should have in deciding how to teach about slavery and race 41 percent of Americans said parents should have a great deal of influence and a third said the same about social studies teachers. Americans were much less likely to say that the state legislature and governor should have much influence.  These data show that most folks would like to have this taken care of at the local level and in particular by those people who are closest to the action the teachers and the parents of schoolchildren Plutzer said.  Even so many of these decisions are being made at the state level. Fourteen states have imposed bans on teaching what they see as critical race theory and restrictions on how teachers can discuss racism and sexism either through legislation or other avenues. And an Education Week analysis found that Republicans this year have drastically broadened their legislative efforts to censor what s taught in the classroom with new bills seeking to restrict teaching that the United States is a racist country that certain economic or political systems are racist or that multiple gender identities exist. The survey found that 59 percent of Republicans think parents of schoolchildren should have a great deal of influence over the teaching of slavery and race in schools while only 16 percent say the same about teachers. These results are flipped among Democrats Nearly half say that social studies teachers should have a great deal of influence in the curriculum while 24 percent say the same about parents.  More than onethird of Democrats and 13 percent of Republicans think state departments of education should wield that much influence.   This reflects a political divide in terms of the deference we show to experts Plutzer said. There s a greater distrust of expertise these days among Republicans and I think that is reflected here in the somewhat lower support for teachers and the much lower support for educators and education experts at the department of education who spend their lives trying to figure out the most effective ways to achieve education goals.  Meanwhile half of educators say parents should be somewhat involved in selecting curriculum and materials according to a nationally representative EdWeek Research Center survey of educators conducted in December. Yet in reality more than twothirds of educators said parents are very or somewhat uninvolved that survey found. The survey also found that 90 percent of Americans think that schools should teach scientific evolution but 44 percent think that schools should also teach biblical perspectives about creation alongside evolution.  Experts say that giving equal time to both creationism and evolution sends mixed messages to students and could confuse them. A 2019 study also done by Plutzer found that about twothirds of public high school biology teachers emphasize the broad scientific consensus on evolution without giving credence to creationism but about a fifth present creationism as a scientifically valid alternative to evolution.

Republicans are three times more likely than Democrats to say that sex education classes should recommend abstinence before marriage 37 percent compared to 12 percent.  This survey shines a light on just how many opinions about education issues may be influenced by politics said Craig Helmstetter a managing partner at APM Research Lab who coauthored the report.   There are clear political divides on all of these topics that we might like to think of as local issues or academic issues he said. We re just trying to educate the children but this is another case where it looks like politics are creeping in and dividing us.

Sign up for the City Journal newsletter today. Read more of our affirmative action and preferences coverage here. To what extent if at all are critical race theory CRT and gender ideology being taught or promoted in America s schools? With little data available and no agreement about what constitutes the teaching of critical social justice CSJ ideas the answer up to now has remained open to political interpretation. Motivated by the work of Manhattan Institute senior fellow and City Journal contributing editor Christopher F. Rufo many on the right allege that CRTrelated concepts such as systemic racism and white privilege are infiltrating the curricula of public schools around the country. Educators following these curricula are said to be teaching students that racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes are fundamentally the result of racism and that white people are the privileged beneficiaries of a social system that oppresses blacks and other people of color. On gender they are being taught that gender identity is a choice regardless of biological sex. But are the cases Rufo and others point to representative of American public schools at large or are they merely outliers amplified by rightwing media? The response to these charges from many on the left has been to deny or downplay them. CRT they contend is a legal theory taught only in university law programs. Therefore what conservatives are up in arms about is not the teaching of CRT but the teaching of America s uncomfortable racial history. But strong connections exist between the cultural radicalism of CRT and the onesided decontextualized portrayal of American history and society that Democratic activists endorse. And these ideas have also influenced many Democratic voters. Indeed according to a 2021 YouGov survey large majorities of Democratic respondents support public schools teaching many of the morally and empirically contentious ideas to which opponents of CRT object. These include the notions that racism is systemic in America 85 percent support that all disparities between blacks and whites are caused by discrimination 72 percent that white people enjoy certain privileges based on their race 85 percent and that they have a responsibility to address racial inequality 87 percent. Whatever one thinks of these ideas they are hardly settled facts on the same epistemic plane as heliocentrism natural selection or even climate change. To the contrary they are a moralideological justso theory of group differences an allencompassing worldview akin to a secular religion whose claims can t be measured tested or falsified. They treat an observed phenomenon disparate group outcomes as evidence of its cause racism while specifying causal mechanisms that are nebulous if not magical. Their advocates have not refuted counterarguments they ve merely asserted empirically unverified statements about the nature of group differences. Publicly funded schools that teach and pass off leftwing racialideological theories and concepts as if they are undisputed factual knowledge or that impart tendentiously curated readings of history are therefore engaging in indoctrination not education. The question before us then is not whether or to what extent public schools are assigning the works of Richard Delgado Kimberl Crenshaw and other critical race theorists. It is whether schools are uncritically promoting a leftwing racial ideology. To answer this and other related questions we commissioned a study on a nationally representative sample of 1505 18 to 20yearold Americans a demographic that has yet to graduate from or only recently graduated from high school. A complete Manhattan Institute report of all the findings from this study will be published in the coming months what follows is a preview of some of them. Our analysis here focuses mainly on the results for the sample overall rather than for various subgroups. We began by asking our 18 to 20yearold respondents 82.4 percent of whom reported attending public schools whether they had ever been taught in class or heard about from an adult at school each of six concepts four of which are central to critical race theory. The chart below which displays the distribution of responses for each concept shows that been taught is the modal response for all but one of the six concepts. For the CRTrelated concepts 62 percent reported either being taught in class or hearing from an adult in school that America is a systemically racist country 69 percent reported being taught or hearing that white people have white privilege 57 percent reported being taught or hearing that white people have unconscious biases that negatively affect nonwhite people and 67 percent reported being taught or hearing that America is built on stolen land. The shares giving either response with respect to genderrelated concepts are slightly lower but still a majority. Fiftythree percent report they were either taught in class or heard from an adult at school that America is a patriarchal society and 51 percent report being taught or hearing that gender is an identity choice regardless of biological sex. We also wanted to assess whether certain concepts were more likely to be taught in some educational contexts than in others. To this end we separately asked respondents whether in high school college or other educational settings they were ever taught that discrimination is the main reason for differences in wealth or other outcomes between races or genders or that there are many genders not just male and female. Overall excluding those who didn t know 62 percent were taught that discrimination is the main reason for outcome gaps and a third were taught that there are many genders. As shown in the chart below which includes don t know answers statistically significant if only modest differences emerged between respondents with no versus at least some prior college instruction 58 percent and 26 percent of those in the latter group respectively report having been taught these two concepts compared with 50 percent and 25 percent of those in the former. Far from being the preserve of academic curricula then CSJ ideas central to contemporary leftwing racial and gender ideology are being taught to students before they arrive at college. The summary chart below underscores the pervasiveness of at least some form of exposure to these concepts. For instance 93 percent of respondents reported either being taught 85 percent or hearing from an adult at school about at least one of the eight listed concepts with an average of 4.3 concepts 90 percent reported either being taught 80 percent or hearing about at least one of the five CRTrelated concepts with an average of 3.0 concepts and 74 percent reported either being taught 54 percent or hearing about at least one of the three genderrelated concepts with an average of 1.3 concepts. While these figures are for the sample overall they do not meaningfully differ by school type. Levels of exposure were similar regardless of whether respondents reported attending public or private high schools. Perhaps it s wrong to assume that the teaching of these CSJ concepts necessarily amounts to ideological indoctrination. After all such concepts are salient on social and other media and have also been uttered or invoked by prominent politicians. Perhaps then most teachers are merely using them as fodder for healthy classroom debate or presenting them as perspectives among other competing ideas. Yet our data suggest that this is hardly the majority experience. Specifically we asked those who reported being taught at least one of the listed concepts in a high school class what if anything they were taught about arguments opposing them. As shown in the chart below 68 percent responded that they either were not taught about opposing arguments or were taught that there are no respectable opposing arguments. Importantly this rate does not meaningfully vary by race political orientation or high school type. Whites 30 percent and nonwhites 34 percent Democrats 29 percent and Republicans 31 percent liberals 29 percent and conservatives 31 percent and public 32 percent and private or parochial 28 percent schoolers were equally likely to report being told about respectable counterarguments. No evidence then suggests that this response reflects respondents political biases. Instead the data suggest that large majorities in all groups have been given the impression that the concepts they were taught are beyond reproach. And these data hardly tell the full story in our forthcoming report we additionally show that the number of concepts respondents report being taught is positively related to the probability of being told there that opposing arguments are not respectable.  If this isn t indoctrination unwitting or otherwise then what is? The prevalence of students classroom exposure to leftwing ideological concepts raises the question of its attitudinal effect. Are students who report receiving such instruction more woke than those who do not? Given the many other sources of attitudinal influence with which any effect of exposure must compete there is ample reason for skepticism. At the same time our respondents are in a phase of life in which by some accounts social and political attitudes are malleable. The potential for exposure to shape related attitudes is plausible. In fact in a dissertation chapter one of us found that having white respondents read a short racially woke oped article led to eight to 12point increases mostly via increases in collective shame and guilt in support for racebased affirmative action government assistance and reparations to AfricanAmericans. If attitudinal shifts of this magnitude can be produced over a span of just minutes what might be the effects of more protracted exposure? It s also fair to say that many educators incorporating such concepts into their instruction expect or at least hope that doing so makes a difference in the minds of students. Indeed the notion that concepts like white privilege and systemic racism are solely taught for knowledge s sake strains credulity especially when such instruction usually entails the omission or delegitimization of competing arguments. The hope instead seems to be that students will come to see white people as ultimately responsible for the creation and persistence of racial inequality and that this realization will inspire support for raceconscious equity oriented policies. Perhaps this hope is illfounded but our data indicate otherwise. As an initial test we examined whether those who report being taught a given concept are more likely to endorse it. For instance the chart below shows that relative to those who reported they were not taught the related concept those who indicated they were taught it were 14 points more likely to agree that the blackwhite pay gap is mainly due to discrimination 15 points more likely to agree that being white is one of the most important sources of privilege in America 23 points more likely to agree that white people have unconscious biases that negatively affect nonwhite people and 29 points more likely to agree that America is built on stolen land. These differences all statistically significant at the 99.9 percent level persist after adjustments for a host of theoretically plausible alternative explanations including race political orientation county rurality county partisanship county racial liberalism and county school segregation. If the effects of CSJrelated instruction were entirely limited to the above its proponents would likely be disappointed. For what good is increasing agreement with CSJrelated concepts if that agreement doesn t translate to increased support for antiracist policies? However because such policies discriminate on the basis of race and can thus be regarded as unfair increasing support for them particularly among whites may not be so easy. To this end it s important that instruction increases the justifying belief that white people are to blame for and thus are responsible for rectifying black disadvantage. Our next analysis thus examines whether the volume of CRTrelated classroom exposure which we define as the total number of CRTrelated concepts respondents reported being taught in school from zero to five affects attitudes toward white Americans and problack policies like affirmative action and racebased government assistance. First we consider whether exposure to a larger share of the five concepts increases agreement with the view that white Americans are ultimately responsible for the inferior social position of black people. Referring to the dark blue bars in the chart below this indeed appears to be the case. Support is lowest 32 percent among those who didn t recall being taught any of the five CRTrelated concepts the no exposure group and agreement rises albeit nonlinearly to a high of 75 percent among those who report being taught all five concepts. Adjusting for alternative explanations has a minimal effect on this 43point difference in attitudes between those taught no CRT concepts and those taught all five which remains statistically significant. We next consider whether exposure increases agreement with the broadbrush generalization that white Americans are racist and mean an item one of us has previously tested and used as an indicator of collective moral shame among whites. As denoted by the light blue bars agreement with this statement begins at a low of 40 percent among those in the no exposure group and increases again nonlinearly to a high of 72 percent for those who report being taught all five concepts. This difference remains significant when controlling for alternative explanatory variables. If greater CRTrelated classroom exposure increases the endorsement of negative moral appraisals of white Americans we d also expect it to boost support for groupbased policies that afford preferential treatment to African Americans even when descriptions of such policies explicitly speak to the risk of discrimination against whites as our measure of support for affirmative action adopted from the General Social Survey does. Consistent with this prediction our data show that support for the preferential hiring and promotion of black people falls to a low of 17 percent among those who reported hearing no CRT while reaching a high of 44 percent among those who reported being taught all five CRTrelated concepts. Similarly the belief that the government should help black people versus our government should not be giving special treatment to black people is endorsed by 35 percent of those in the no exposure group compared with 43 percent of those who reported being taught one concept 51 percent to 54 percent of those who reported being taught two to four concepts and 72 percent of those who reported being taught all five concepts. Again a 30 to 40point difference emerges between those who were not taught CRT material and those who received the maximum dose of it. Here we should note that the above results are similar for white and nonwhite respondents alike even if not always to the same degree. One relationship that is necessarily exclusive to whites though is that between exposure and white guilt which is shown in the chart below. Whereas 39 percent of whites who did not report any CRTrelated classroom exposure indicated feeling guilty about the social inequalities between white and black Americans this share rises to about 45 percent among whites who reported being taught one or two CRTrelated concepts and to between 54 percent and 58 percent among whites who reported being taught three or more concepts. These findings indicate that those reporting being taught more CRTrelated concepts are more likely to endorse negative moral appraisals of and to view white Americans as responsible for black disadvantage. Among whites greater CRT exposure is also linked to higher levels of guilt over racial inequality. Finally and perhaps consequently greater CRT exposure predicts a higher likelihood of both white and minority young people supporting raceconscious policies that afford preferential treatment to AfricanAmericans. The same is true for gender. Among those that were taught that gender is a choice 53 percent say the gender we identify with is more socially given than determined by our biology compared with 40 percent of those who were not taught this a significant difference. Those taught about gender as an identity are more likely to view it as detached from biological sex. While we can t be certain that exposure causes attitude change those with progressive attitudes could have had parents more likely to select into schools where CRT is taught or to recall being exposed to it we used data from a person s zip code and county rurality diversity education voting patterns that make such competing explanations unlikely. We can also rule out the possibility that these relationships are the product of alternative explanatory factors in our dataset. While only scratching the surface of what will feature in the full report our findings have several important takeaways. First the claim that CRT and gender ideology are not being taught or promoted in America s precollege public schools is grossly misleading. More than nine in ten of our respondents reported some form of school exposure to at least some CRTrelated and critical gender concepts with the average respondent reporting being taught in class or hearing about from an adult at school more than half of the eight concepts we measured. Eight in ten reported being taught in class at least one concept central to CRT and contemporary leftwing racial ideology with the average respondent reporting being taught two of the five we listed. A majority were taught radical gender ideas. Given the sheer size of these numbers the promotion and teaching of white privilege and systemic racism in America s public schools can hardly be regarded as a rare or isolated phenomenon. It is the experience of a sizeable share of precollege students. Second educators are presenting CSJ ideas to students uncritically. If such concepts were presented only as perspectives and in conjunction with competing others then their introduction into the classroom could very well be defensible. But our data suggest that this is not the case. Instead most are receiving them as undisputed facts or at least facts only disputed by bigots and ignoramuses. This is indoctrination and governments should act swiftly to put a stop to it. Moredetailed policy recommendations must await the full report. But schools and teachers that wish to teach about these concepts should be given the option of either teaching the diversity of thought surrounding them or being barred from teaching them altogether. Third such biased instruction is effective. Our data show that those who report being taught CRTrelated concepts are not only more likely to endorse them but are also more likely to blame white people for racial inequality to essentialize white people as racist and to support equityoriented racebased policies. Among whites we also observe higher levels of white guilt among those exposed to more CRTrelated concepts. Overall then our data would appear to confirm many of the fears of antiCRT activists about such instruction. Anecdotes are borne out by our representative largescale data. Critical race and gender theory is endemic in American schools. The vast majority of children are being taught radical CSJ concepts that affect their view of white people their country the relationship between gender and sex and public policy. For those inclined toward a colorblind and realitybased ideal these findings should serve as a wakeup call. Unless voters parents and governments act these illiberal and unscientific ideas will spread more widely and will replace traditional American liberal nationalism with an identitybased cultural socialism.

https://www.chalkbeat.org/2022/5/3/23055884/critical-race-theory-schools-polling/, So what do American voters and parents actually think about these issues? It can be hard to get a good sense of that amid an avalanche of anecdotes news stories and viral videos. Chalkbeat examined over 20 polls since last year to find out. In some cases what we found was surprising while others confirmed conventional wisdom. And there were instances of both widespread agreement and sharp division. There are real divides in this country on how to teach about race and racism particularly on whether to teach about racism as a presentday phenomenon. Parents are also divided about whether schools pay too much or too little attention to race and racism. But most parents surveyed also say their child s school does a good job keeping them apprised of what s taught in class. More broadly most Americans agree on certain issues that schools should teach about the history of slavery and racism that books shouldn t be banned for political reasons and that schools shouldn t divide students by race for class discussions. Keep in mind that polling provides only a snapshot of opinion and results can shift based on question framing political messaging or the arguments of one side or the other. That said here are several important takeaways from these surveys. Perhaps the simplest way of understanding the clashes over schools is the question posed in a recent Associated Press poll Do you think your local public school system is focusing too much or too little on racism in the U.S. or is the focus about right?  Divisions were clear 37 of Americans said about right 34 said there was too little focus and 27 said there was too much. In other words a majority of adults believe schools need to change the amount of focus but they diverge on what direction they should go. This split is echoed in other polling too including surveys of parents. Divides about schools break sharply along racial and political lines. Democrats and people of color tend to support a stronger focus on race in schools Republicans and white Americans tend to be much more skeptical of focusing on race. This pattern shows up in poll after poll in mostly predictable ways including a national poll about how much schools should teach about racial inequality. The academic framework known as critical race theory has morphed into a catchall term for conservative critics on the right to refer to practices in schools relating to race that they oppose. Unsurprisingly it typically doesn t poll all that well although many people say they re not sure what it means. At the same time discussing the presentday effects of racism does draw meaningful although not overwhelming support. You can see the disconnect in a poll of Missouri voters. In a national poll a slim majority of Americans held negative views about critical race theory. The academic framework of critical race theory probably is rarely taught in schools although it has informed practices in some school systems. At the same time threequarters said that public schools should be allowed to teach about ideas and historical events that might make some students uncomfortable and even more opposed banning books in schools. Another poll found that 53 of voters believe it s appropriate to teach high school students that systemic racism is embedded in American institutions while 46 say it s not appropriate. Americans more broadly agreed that schools should teach about slavery and racism as a historical matter. Notably though people seem to have somewhat less appetite for frank discussions about race and racism in early grades. Some are quite unpopular. For instance one poll found that 51 of adults favored tracking students by ability level even though the question said that some fear that this will exacerbate racial inequities. Only 19 opposed tracking. Another survey asked about grouping students by race to encourage students to discuss their experiences with others who share their racial or ethnic background. 76 of voters described this practice as harmful. Most Americans of all races also favored using standardized test scores as a part of college admissions despite recent pushback that these tests discriminate against Black and Hispanic students. And most also opposed racebased preferences in college admissions. But polls show significant support for ideas like having students read a racially diverse set of authors or learn more about Black history. In one survey 60 of public school parents said students should be encouraged to read books by authors from a variety of different racial and ethnic backgrounds.  One poll found a plurality of parents 40 believed schools are handling issues related to race and racism about right. That was notably higher than the general public. Another 29 said schools aren t focused enough on these issues.  In another recent survey only 19 of parents said that the way their child s school teaches about racism was inconsistent with their own values. 38 said the school s approach was consistent with their values and another 32 weren t sure. The vast majority of parents also said their child s school does at least a decent job keeping them abreast of curriculum on controversial topics according to multiple polls. Throughout the pandemic most parents have expressed general satisfaction with their child s school.  All these issues are deeply linked with politics. After Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin s upset win last year Republicans have been on the offense on education issues. Many see attacks on critical race theory or too much attention to race in schools as a winning issue for this November. But voters continue to trust Democrats on education issues more than Republicans according to multiple polls. In one 44 said Democrats values on education more closely align with their own compared with 34 who favored Republicans. Parents gave Democrats a 5 point edge. Another recent survey found a severalpoint advantage for Democrats but showed that it had dipped since 2019 and was at its lowest point in many years.

https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/map-where-critical-race-theory-is-under-attack/2021/06, Republican state lawmakers continued their crusade against critical race theory through the 2022 legislative session passing new legislation in Georgia Florida Mississippi and other states that further regulates how the nation s teachers can discuss racism sexism and issues of systemic inequality in the classroom. The trend has proved to be an ongoing minefield for teachers and school districts some of whom have already faced challenges to lessons and professional development courses in states where these laws have passed.   In Oklahoma for example the state board of education downgraded the accreditation for two school districts that it claimed violated the state s law targeting critical race theory. In July a Tennessee parent group sued local and state education leaders over a curriculum it claims the state law prohibits. These laws and their consequences are just one manifestation of the increased scrutiny schools are facing in teaching about any issues that could be deemed controversial. Even in states without CRT legislation school boards and parent groups have challenged curriculum choices sought to remove library books and called for teachers to take down flags or banners supporting social justice causes. Since January 2021 44 states have introduced bills or taken other steps that would restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism according to an Education Week analysis. Eighteen states have imposed these bans and restrictions either through legislation or other avenues. Throughout the 2021 legislative session most of these bills were centered on a list of prohibited divisive concepts. This list has its origins in a September 2020 executive order signed by thenPresident Donald Trump which banned certain types of diversity training in federal agencies. For more on the origins of this state legislative movement see this story. The order which has since been revoked by President Joe Biden prohibited trainings that promoted certain ideas for example that one race or sex is inherently better than another that all people of a certain race have unconscious bias or that the United States is a fundamentally racist or sexist country. It was written in response to the antiracism and antibias trainings that many workplaces including schools began after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Pundits advocacy groups and parents mostly conservative but some across the political spectrum fiercely opposed these exercises along with other efforts schools were making to diversify curricula and materials. They argued that schools were placing too much of a focus on race causing white children to feel guilty and overemphasizing the dark difficult chapters of American history at the expense of fostering patriotism. They labeled these kinds of activities critical race theory.  The term refers to a decadesold academic theory that holds that racism is systemic perpetrated by structural forces rather than individual acts of bias. But over the past two years the phrase has been warped from its original meaning used by opponents to refer to anything that makes race or gender salient in conversations about history current events or literature. Several of the state bills proposed in the 2021 legislative session describe Trump s list of divisive concepts as critical race theory even though scholars of the framework maintain that it doesn t teach that certain races are better than others or that individuals are inherently racist. With this fuzziness around terminology teachers and school leaders in states where these laws have passed have reported widespread confusion about what kind of instruction is and is not allowed. For example while many proponents of these laws claim that they shouldn t curtail discussions of events in U.S. history one parent group in Tennessee invoked the state s law in attempts to pull a book about the civil rights movement. Meanwhile some of the laws passed during the 2021 legislative session have already faced legal challenges. Lawsuits have been filed in Oklahoma and New Hampshire claiming that the laws deprive teachers of freespeech and equal protection rights.

https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/four-things-schools-wont-be-able-to-do-under-critical-race-theory-laws/2021/06, While the debate over critical race theory has driven the passage of laws restricting how teachers talk with students about America s racist past only eight of the 26 bills actually refer to critical race theory according to an Education Week analysis of proposed and passed legislation and state school board policies.  Portions of many states bills are vague and myopic about what will and will not be allowed in schools. But other sections lay out in sweeping language exactly what administrators and teachers will no longer be allowed to do.    Many of the bills for example would drastically curtail how districts conduct antibias training for teachers and severely limit schools ability to offer ethnic studies courses or partner with outside advocacy organizations.  Although the wave of state legislation has been dubbed as having to do with critical race theory by the mainstream media and by civil rights advocates many of the classroom discussions that will ultimately be affected this fall don t have anything to do with race in fact. Several of the bills will also shut down teacherstudent discussions having to do with sex gender discrimination and LGBTQ identity. The punishment spelled out in the bills is steep. In Arizona s pending legislation if teachers talk about racism or sexism in the classroom they could be fined 5000. In Tennessee these lessons will cost the school district state aid money.  Advocates for the bills say divisive classroom discussions can politically indoctrinate students and be demoralizing for white children.  But because the language in the bills is so broad many social justice advocates fear that it will put a chilling effect on teachers discussing with their students any aspect of American racism sexism and homophobia.   Teachers are already overstressed as a result of the pandemic and teaching online said Amanda Vickery an associate professor of social studies and race in education who teaches a course on critical race theory at the University of North Texas and trains teachers on how to incorporate Black women s voices into curriculum. But now there is this heightened fear that I feel like these bills are causing for teachers.  What s most wellknown by the general public to be under attack through these bills is the way teachers talk to students about the history of American racism. But what s lesser known is that instead of banning teachers use of critical race theory in the classroom the laws proposed in most of the states prohibit anyone from making a student at school feel discomfort guilt anguish or any other form of psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex.   Richard Corcoran Floridas education commissioner left and Andy Tuck the chairman of the states board of education listen as Diana Greene the superintendent of Duval County Public Schools addresses board members before they voted to remove the use of critical race theory in the states public schools. Bob SelfThe Florida TimesUnion via AP  Administrators who have closely read the bills or laws in their states say this sort of broad ban will make it difficult for teachers to talk about the day s news most American social justice movements and many historical events that involved explicit acts of white supremacy.   If any child in the classroom at any point feels discomfort then the teacher essentially is violating this law said Cecilia RobinsonWoods superintendent of the predominantly Black Millwood school district in Oklahoma. This law essentially is saying that if you don t feel comfortable with it you don t have to talk about it.  In recent years some school districts with shifting racial demographics have launched multipronged efforts to better serve students of color. They ve formed diversity inclusion and equity committees made up of students teachers and administrators hired equity officers and offered ongoing training for teachers to recognize and rid themselves of their unconscious biases which many experts argue lead to among other things disproportionate suspensions and expulsions for Black and Latino students. Now in least nine states those efforts advocates and district administrators say would effectively come to a halt.  The Texas law for example makes it illegal for teachers to be required to engage in training orientation or therapy that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or blame on the basis of race or sex.   An opponent of critical race theory protests outside a Washoe County School District board meeting earlier this year in Reno Nev.Andy BarronReno GazetteJournal via AP  Oklahoma s law similarly bans diversity training that presents any form of race or sex stereotyping or a bias on the basis of race or sex... .  Districts across the country often partner with local community organizations to assist with efforts to make diverse groups of students such as Englishlanguage learners or homeless children feel more welcomed in the classroom.  But school districts in Texas and Iowa will have a difficult time hiring outside advocacy organizations to conduct this sort of training or offer lessons on antiracism under their new state laws.  Iowa s law for example says the superintendent of each school district shall ensure that any curriculum or mandatory staff or student training provided by an employee of the school district or by a contractor hired by the school district does not teach advocate encourage promote or act upon specific stereotyping and scapegoating toward others on the basis of demographic group membership or identity.  A few years ago the Dallas school district started offering courses on Black and Latino studies. Now according to Superintendent Michael Hinojosa it will have to stop offering those classes because the law in Texas requires teachers to teach social studies without giving deference to any one perspective.  In Oklahoma school leaders were unsure whether teaching about the Tulsa Race Massacre in which a white mob with the assistance of the local government murdered hundreds of Black people and burned down dozens of businesses on its centennial is allowed though officials disagree about this interpretation since the Tulsa massacre is in the state s standards.  Supporters of critical race theory chanted allow teachers to teach the truth during a meeting of Floridas state board of education in early June in Jacksonville. The board voted to remove the use of critical race theory in the states public schools.Bob SelfThe Florida TimesUnion via AP  The bills also aim to restrict how schools can teach about sexism and gender identity.  Most bills would prohibit educators from teaching students that an individual by virtue of the individual s race or sex is inherently privileged racist sexist or oppressive whether consciously or subconsciously.  The language in some states bills is even more explicit and bans classroom discussions about gender identity. For example the proposed bill in Ohio would prohibit teachers from being required to affirm a belief... in the multiplicity or fluidity of gender identities or like ideas against the teacher s sincerely held religious or philosophical convictions.

https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05, Is critical race theory a way of understanding how American racism has shaped public policy or a divisive discourse that pits people of color against white people? Liberals and conservatives are in sharp disagreement.  The topic has exploded in the public arena this spring especially in K12 where numerous state legislatures are debating bills seeking to ban its use in the classroom.  In truth the divides are not nearly as neat as they may seem. The events of the last decade have increased public awareness about things like housing segregation the impacts of criminal justice policy in the 1990s and the legacy of enslavement on Black Americans. But there is much less consensus on what the government s role should be in righting these past wrongs. Add children and schooling into the mix and the debate becomes especially volatile.  School boards superintendents even principals and teachers are already facing questions about critical race theory and there are significant disagreements even among experts about its precise definition as well as how its tenets should inform K12 policy and practice. This explainer is meant only as a starting point to help educators grasp core aspects of the current debate. Critical race theory is an academic concept that is more than 40 years old. The core idea is that race is a social construct and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice but also something embedded in legal systems and policies. The basic tenets of critical race theory or CRT emerged out of a framework for legal analysis in the late 1970s and early 1980s created by legal scholars Derrick Bell Kimberl Crenshaw and Richard Delgado among others.  A good example is when in the 1930s government officials literally drew lines around areas deemed poor financial risks often explicitly due to the racial composition of inhabitants. Banks subsequently refused to offer mortgages to Black people in those areas.

CRT also has ties to other intellectual currents including the work of sociologists and literary theorists who studied links between political power social organization and language. And its ideas have since informed other fields like the humanities the social sciences and teacher education. This academic understanding of critical race theory differs from representation in recent popular books and especially from its portrayal by critics often though not exclusively conservative Republicans. Critics charge that the theory leads to negative dynamics such as a focus on group identity over universal shared traits divides people into oppressed and oppressor groups and urges intolerance. Thus there is a good deal of confusion over what CRT means as well as its relationship to other terms like antiracism and social justice with which it is often conflated. To an extent the term critical race theory is now cited as the basis of all diversity and inclusion efforts regardless of how much it s actually informed those programs.  One conservative organization the Heritage Foundation recently attributed a whole host of issues to CRT including the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests LGBTQ clubs in schools diversity training in federal agencies and organizations California s recent ethnic studies model curriculum the freespeech debate on college campuses and alternatives to exclusionary discipline such as the Promise program in Broward County Fla. that some parents blame for the Parkland school shootings. When followed to its logical conclusion CRT is destructive and rejects the fundamental ideas on which our constitutional republic is based the organization claimed. A good parallel here is how popular ideas of the common core learning standards grew to encompass far more than what those standards said on paper.  The theory says that racism is part of everyday life so people white or nonwhite who don t intend to be racist can nevertheless make choices that fuel racism.  Some critics claim that the theory advocates discriminating against white people in order to achieve equity. They mainly aim those accusations at theorists who advocate for policies that explicitly take race into account. The writer Ibram X. Kendi whose recent popular book How to Be An Antiracist suggests that discrimination that creates equity can be considered antiracist is often cited in this context. Fundamentally though the disagreement springs from different conceptions of racism. CRT puts an emphasis on outcomes not merely on individuals own beliefs and it calls on these outcomes to be examined and rectified. Among lawyers teachers policymakers and the general public there are many disagreements about how precisely to do those things and to what extent race should be explicitly appealed to or referred to in the process. Here s a helpful illustration to keep in mind in understanding this complex idea. In a 2007 U.S. Supreme Court schoolassignment case on whether race could be a factor in maintaining diversity in K12 schools Chief Justice John Roberts opinion famously concluded The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race. But during oral arguments thenjustice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said It s very hard for me to see how you can have a racial objective but a nonracial means to get there.  All these different ideas grow out of longstanding tenacious intellectual debates. Critical race theory emerged out of postmodernist thought which tends to be skeptical of the idea of universal values objective knowledge individual merit Enlightenment rationalism and liberalism tenets that conservatives tend to hold dear. Scholars who study critical race theory in education look at how policies and practices in K12 education contribute to persistent racial inequalities in education and advocate for ways to change them. Among the topics they ve studied racially segregated schools the underfunding of majorityBlack and Latino school districts disproportionate disciplining of Black students barriers to gifted programs and selectiveadmission high schools and curricula that reinforce racist ideas.  Critical race theory is not a synonym for culturally relevant teaching which emerged in the 1990s. This teaching approach seeks to affirm students ethnic and racial backgrounds and is intellectually rigorous. But it s related in that one of its aims is to help students identify and critique the causes of social inequality in their own lives. Many educators support to one degree or another culturally relevant teaching and other strategies to make schools feel safe and supportive for Black students and other underserved populations. Students of color make up the majority of schoolaged children. But they don t necessarily identify these activities as CRTrelated.

Madeline Will 17 min read Remove Save to favorites  As one teachereducator put it The way we usually see any of this in a classroom is Have I thought about how my Black kids feel? And made a space for them so that they can be successful? That is the level I think it stays at for most teachers. Like others interviewed for this explainer the teachereducator did not want to be named out of fear of online harassment.  An emerging subtext among some critics is that curricular excellence can t coexist alongside culturally responsive teaching or antiracist work. Their argument goes that efforts to change grading practices or make the curriculum less Eurocentric will ultimately harm Black students or hold them to a less high standard.  As with CRT in general its popular representation in schools has been far less nuanced. A recent poll by the advocacy group Parents Defending Education claimed some schools were teaching that white people are inherently privileged while Black and other people of color are inherently oppressed and victimized that achieving racial justice and equality between racial groups requires discriminating against people based on their whiteness and that the United States was founded on racism.  Thus much of the current debate appears to spring not from the academic texts but from fear among critics that students especially white students will be exposed to supposedly damaging or selfdemoralizing ideas. While some district officials have issued mission statements resolutions or spoken about changes in their policies using some of the discourse of CRT it s not clear to what degree educators are explicitly teaching the concepts or even using curriculum materials or other methods that implicitly draw on them. For one thing scholars say much scholarship on CRT is written in academic language or published in journals not easily accessible to K12 teachers. As of midMay legislation purporting to outlaw CRT in schools has passed in Idaho Iowa Oklahoma and Tennessee and have been proposed in various other statehouses. The bills are so vaguely written that it s unclear what they will affirmatively cover.  Could a teacher who wants to talk about a factual instance of statesponsored racism like the establishment of Jim Crow the series of laws that prevented Black Americans from voting or holding office and separated them from white people in public spaces be considered in violation of these laws? It s also unclear whether these new bills are constitutional or whether they impermissibly restrict free speech. It would be extremely difficult in any case to police what goes on inside hundreds of thousands of classrooms. But social studies educators fear that such laws could have a chilling effect on teachers who might selfcensor their own lessons out of concern for parent or administrator complaints. As English teacher Mike Stein told Chalkbeat Tennessee about the new law History teachers can not adequately teach about the Trail of Tears the Civil War and the civil rights movement. English teachers will have to avoid teaching almost any text by an African American author because many of them mention racism to various extents.  The laws could also become a tool to attack other pieces of the curriculum including ethnic studies and action civics an approach to civics education that asks students to research local civic problems and propose solutions. The charge that schools are indoctrinating students in a harmful theory or political mindset is a longstanding one historians note. CRT appears to be the latest salvo in this ongoing debate. In the early and mid20th century the concern was about socialism or Marxism. The conservative American Legion beginning in the 1930s sought to rid schools of progressiveminded textbooks that encouraged students to consider economic inequality two decades later the John Birch Society raised similar criticisms about school materials. As with CRT criticisms the fear was that students would be somehow harmed by exposure to these ideas. As the schoolaged population became more diverse these debates have been inflected through the lens of race and ethnic representation including disagreements over multiculturalism and ethnic studies the ongoing canon wars over which texts should make up the English curriculum and the socalled ebonics debates over the status of Black vernacular English in schools.

Those tensions led to the implosion of a 1994 attempt to set national history standards. A current example that has fueled much of the recent round of CRT criticism is the New York Times 1619 Project which sought to put the history and effects of enslavement as well as Black Americans contributions to democratic reforms at the center of American history. The culture wars are always at some level battled out within schools historians say.  It s because they re nervous about broad social things but they re talking in the language of school and school curriculum said one historian of education.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/508172/majorities-support-racial-education-schools.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Amid discussions across the U.S. about the inclusion of race and racism in K12 curricula broad majorities of Americans think the current impacts of racism and racerelated history topics should be taught in U.S. schools. Recent data from the Gallup Center on Black Voices indicate that more than three in four Americans support curricula that teach students about the current impacts of racism 76. This finding comes amid new legislation restricting some lessons on presentday racism. While 87 of Black adults support the inclusion of the current impacts of racism in the U.S. 72 of White adults and 77 of Hispanic adults agree. Americans are somewhat more likely to support addressing historical racism in K12 curricula as four in five support curricula that include the history of racism in the U.S. 81. Even more Americans support teaching Black Americans contributions to the U.S. and their impact on society today 86. Black adults are slightly more likely than White and Hispanic adults to say these topics should be taught. Still large majorities of each group agree. These latest findings from a March 30April 14 web survey of more than 13000 U.S. adults are similar to data from October 2021. Currentday impacts of racism are the largest focus of recent policy decisions. Earlier this year several states blocked a proposed Advanced Placement course about African American studies that was set to pilot in over 50 high schools nationwide and more states soon adopted their own reviews of the content. Much of the decision to block the course was due to references to the impacts of racism in the postCivil Rights era particularly material from contemporary authors. Proponents of the legislation say it would allow teaching the history of slavery and past racial discrimination. Republicans are the least likely to support all three topics in U.S. curricula while Democrats are the most likely. Americans are more divided on including Juneteenth commemorating the end of slavery in the U.S. in public school curricula as 61 of U.S. adults say it should be included and 20 say it should not. Eighteen percent of Americans say they don t know whether the history of Juneteenth should be taught perhaps reflecting a lack of familiarity with the holiday. As with other racerelated curricular topics Black adults are significantly more likely than others to support the teaching of Juneteenth history. Although Juneteenth became a federal holiday in 2021 after receiving bipartisan support in Congress partisans differ sharply in their preferences for including it in public school curricula. While 82 of Democrats think Juneteenth history should be taught 59 of independents and 36 of Republicans agree. The content of curricula in U.S. K12 schools has received increased attention in recent years as there has been an uptick in the passage of laws restricting certain topics. Since 2021 241 measures seeking to restrict the teaching of race and the impacts of racism have been adopted in the U.S. Yet as a whole Americans support the inclusion of race and racismrelated curricula in U.S. schools and this support has remained stable since 2021. Americans broadly support the inclusion of current impacts of racism in the U.S. the history of racism in the U.S. and Black Americans contributions to the U.S. and their impact on society today. As schools adapt to new legislation limiting the teaching of race and the impacts of racism further restrictions may be out of step with the opinions of Americans more broadly.

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2024/02/22/race-and-lgbtq-issues-in-k-12-schools/, The bulk of the analysis in this report is based on an online survey of 2531 U.S. public K12 teachers conducted from Oct. 17 to Nov. 14 2023. The teachers surveyed are members of RAND s American Teacher Panel a nationally representative panel of public school K12 teachers recruited through MDR Education. Survey data is weighted to state and national teacher characteristics to account for differences in sampling and response to ensure they are representative of the target population. For the questions for the general public we surveyed 5029 U.S. adults from Nov. 9 to Nov. 16 2023. The adults surveyed are members of the Ipsos KnowledgePanel a nationally representative online survey panel. Panel members are randomly recruited through probabilitybased sampling and households are provided with access to the Internet and hardware if needed. To ensure that the results of this survey reflect a balanced cross section of the nation the data is weighted to match the U.S. adult population by gender age education race and ethnicity and other categories. For questions for teens we conducted an online survey of 1453 U.S. teens from Sept. 26 to Oct. 23 2023 through Ipsos. Ipsos recruited the teens via their parents who were part of its KnowledgePanel. The survey was weighted to be representative of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 who live with their parents by age gender race and ethnicity household income and other categories. The survey on teens was reviewed and approved by an external institutional review board IRB Advarra an independent committee of experts specializing in helping to protect the rights of research participants. Here are the questions used for this report along with responses and the survey methodology. Throughout the report references to White Black and Asian adults include those who are not Hispanic and identify as only one race. Hispanics are of any race. The views and experiences of teachers and teens who are Asian American or part of other racial and ethnic groups are not analyzed separately in this report due to sample limitations. Data for these groups is incorporated into the general population figures throughout the report. All references to party affiliation include those who lean toward that party. Republicans include those who identify as Republicans and those who say they lean toward the Republican Party. Democrats include those who identify as Democrats and those who say they lean toward the Democratic Party. Political leaning of school districts is based on whether the majority of those residing in the school district voted for Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election. Amid national debates about what schools are teaching we asked public K12 teachers teens and the American public how they see topics related to race sexual orientation and gender identity playing out in the classroom. A sizeable share of teachers 41 say these debates have had a negative impact on their ability to do their job. Just 4 say these debates have had a positive impact while 53 say the impact has been neither positive nor negative or that these debates have had no impact. And 71 of teachers say teachers themselves don t have enough influence over what s taught in public schools in their area. In turn a majority of teachers 58 say their state government has too much influence over this. And more say the federal government the local school board and parents have too much influence than say they don t have enough. Most of the findings in this report come from a survey of 2531 U.S. public K12 teachers conducted Oct. 17Nov. 14 2023 using the RAND American Teacher Panel.1 The survey looks at teachers views on It follows a fall 2022 survey of K12 parents that explored similar topics. This report also includes some findings from a survey of U.S. teens ages 13 to 17 Chapter 3 and a survey of U.S. adults Chapter 4. For details about these surveys refer to the Methodology section of this report. Among the key findings We asked public K12 teachers what they think students should learn in school about two topics in particular For these questions elementary middle and high school teachers were asked about elementary middle and high school students respectively. Most teachers 64 say students should learn that the legacy of slavery still affects the position of Black people in American society today. About a quarter 23 say students should learn that slavery is part of American history but no longer affects the position of Black people in American society. Just 8 say students shouldn t learn about this topic in school at all. Majorities of elementary middle and high school teachers say students should learn that the legacy of slavery still has an impact on the lives of Black Americans. When it comes to teaching about gender identity specifically whether a person s gender can be different from or is determined by their sex assigned at birth half of public K12 teachers say students shouldn t learn about this in school. A third of teachers think students should learn that someone can be a boy or a girl even if that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. A smaller share 14 say students should learn that whether someone is a boy or a girl is determined by their sex at birth. Views differ among elementary middle and high school teachers. But teachers across the three levels are more likely to say students should learn that a person s gender can be different from their sex at birth than to say students should learn gender is determined by sex at birth.
