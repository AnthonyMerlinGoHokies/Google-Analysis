https://stephenhalbrook.com/second-amendment-post-sniper-policy/, by Stephen P. HalbrookNational Law Journal Nov. 11 2002 and New Jersey Law Journal Nov. 18 2002 The terror spread by the Washington D.Carea snipers has prompted two reactions. One is to enact laws for ballistic fingerprinting of all firearms and to ban sniper rifles. The other is to focus on how to identify apprehend and sentence such terrorists to death. The rampage took place at a unique time in the guncontrol debate. The Sept. 11 hijackers proved that terrorists don t need firearms. The cry Let s roll! on United Flight 93 rendered pass the doctrine of nonresistance to criminality and sparked the widespread call that airline pilots be armed. Democrats have learned the perils of advocating gun control. The Clinton administration argued that only a collective state power to a militia is guaranteed by the Second Amendment. But Al Gore lost key states to unhappy hunters. Just after Sept. 11 2001 the Fifth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decided U.S. v. Emerson ruling for the hunters that the Second Amendment protects the right of individuals to privately keep and bear their own firearms that are suitable as individual personal weapons.  The Department of Justice under Attorney General John Ashcroft has argued that the amendment broadly protects the rights of individuals to possess and bear their own firearms excluding possession by unfit persons and firearm types particularly suited to criminal misuse.  That brings us to John Allen Muhammad and Lee Malvo. The harshest critics of Ashcroft s views on the amendment blame the sniper attacks on the lack of common sense gun control. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence has claimed that ballistic fingerprinting would have solved this crime after the first shooting. The Violence Policy Center urged that tougher restrictions must be placed on socalled sniper rifles such as the .50 .308 and .223 calibers and Rep. John Conyers DMich. wrote in a letter to the Federal Trade Commission that sniper rifles are designed to strike a target from a distance.  But it is unclear how a sniper rifle is different from a hunting rifle. Since only one shot was fired in each of the murders any type of rifle could have been used. In fact it was a Bushmaster XM15 semiautomatic. While that rifle is not an assault weapon as defined by federal law the killing spree is being used to argue for reenactment of the federal assault weapon ban which sunsets in 2004. The serial sniper also revived S. 3096 a bill sponsored by Senator Herb Kohl DWis. that would require ballistics testing of all new firearms. The images of the bullet and cartridge casings would go into a computerized database. The effectiveness of the bill would be largely illusory however unless it included the 260 million firearms already out there and their owners identities including those owned by criminals. Moreover fingerprints do not change but bullets deform and shell casings change with normal use and parts replacement and intentional alteration. While ballistics testing may be useful when limited to actual crime guns the Bureau of Forensic Services of the California Justice Department has warned that if samples from all firearms are imaged this number of candidate cases will be so large as to be impractical.  Maryland and New York have enacted laws requiring ballistic imaging for all new handguns sold with no practical results. More intensive investigation of suspected terrorists would be a more productive place to start. According to reports John Allen Muhammad praised the Sept. 11 hijackers and made terrorist threats. His friend Harjett Singh disclosed these plans in June to police and the FBI apparently to no avail. During the killing spree police searched white vans and knocked on the doors of thousands in Maryland who had bought .223 rifles to demand them for testing. Meanwhile the sniper cruised around in a blue Chevy sedan with a rifle from the West Coast. Finally the oldfashioned gumshoe approach of pinpointing specific suspects paid off. It is doubtful that hunting rifles will be banned as a result of the sniper case and it is certain that ballisticimaging plans will be thoroughly studied. But what drives some to commit heinous murders will probably remain a mystery of the human condition. One thing is certain Further criminalization of what peaceable firearm owners perceive to be their Second Amendment rights will have no effect on killers serial or otherwise.

https://yipinstitute.org/article/why-we-should-ban-assault-rifles, email protected Inquirydriven this article reflects personal views aiming to enrich problemrelated discourse.  Our father Eugene Stoner designed the AR15 and subsequent M16 as a military weapon to give our soldiers an advantage over the AK47 Stoner s children said in an interview with NBC News. He died long before any mass shootings occurred. But we do think he would have been horrified and sickened as anyone if not more by these events. Their sentiment is mirrored by millions of Americans who have become increasingly more accustomed to turning on their news only to see horrifying footage of yet another mass shooting. According to a 2019 Gallup article approximately 60 percent of Americans are in favor of an assault rifle ban similar to the one that existed in the United States U.S. from 1994 to 2004. However when weighing this issue there are more points to consider than simply popular support. After reading this article the effectiveness and need for an assault rifle ban will become evident and the legitimacy of an array of common oppositions to this statement will be cast into severe doubt. Many informed citizens on this topic may have picked up on the fact that in the initial example a quote from the inventor of the AR15 is cited a gun that is not officially recognized as an assault rifle. This is due to the fact that this article critiques a piece of legislation that not only bans legitimate assault rifles but also prohibits the sale of all semiautomatic shotguns and rifles that are capable of holding more than 10 rounds as cited from WUSF News. This distinction is important to keep in mind as when considering this case we must look at shootings involving guns like the AR15 not just official assault rifles such as the M16. Semiautomatic weapons are much more commonly used in mass shootings and must be immediately banned. When considering the assault rifle ban detractors will often cite that the majority of the U.S. nearly 40000 annual gun deaths involve handguns and not assault rifles thus showing that assault rifles are not important enough to be banned. The facts however show that the real issues lie in the ability of assault rifles to cause mass indiscriminate death. Of the 28 deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history all but two used some form of semiautomatic weapon that would under a formal assault rifle ban such as the one passed in 1994 be banned. A true eyeopener to the devastating nature of these guns was the 2017 Las Vegas shooting which left 58 dead and 422 injured. The use of bump stock equipped semiautomatic rifles in conjunction with sniper rifles in this deadly killing truly shows the ability for any deranged man woman or teenager to acquire a weapon and use it to slaughter people who they had no qualms with. As American vetran Michael Diamond wrote Assault rifles are uniquely lethal because they re designed to kill as many humans as possible as quickly as possible.  Once one acknowledges that this assault rifle ban would take unnecessarily dangerous weapons off the streets they are met with the dilemma of whether or not any positive change would be brought to the status quo. Luckily for Americans there is a clear example for us to base our research off of. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban had mixed results partially due to the fact that the plan contained numerous grandfathering provisions that would have taken longer to integrate. One conclusion however has been conclusively drawn So using that as a very tentative guide that s high enough to suggest that eliminating or greatly reducing crimes with these magazines could produce a small reduction in shootings likely something less than 5 percent. Now we should note that effects of this magnitude could be hard to ever measure in any very definitive way but they nonetheless could have nontrivial notable benefits for society Christopher Koper said in his immersive report on the topic. Consider for example at our current level of our gun violence achieving a 1 percent reduction in fatal and nonfatal criminal shootings would prevent approximately 650 shootings annually And of course having these sorts of guns and particularly magazines less accessible to offenders could make it more difficult for them to commit the sorts of mass shootings that we ve seen in recent years. This statement is mirrored by the fact that of the 25 mass shootings with over 10 victims that occurred in the 39 year time frame between 1982 and 2020 a grand total of only two occurred between 1994 and 2004. Only one of these two mass shootings used a semiautomatic weapon with the other being committed with a normal pistol. When debating this topic gun advocates will often bring up points such as mass shootings kill only a fraction of people as compared to car accidents assault weapons make up a small portion of gun deaths criminals will still get guns illegally and restricting the access to guns is unconstitutional. Amongst the first two contentions I would ask why this is relevant. Assault weapon homicides are clearly an issue and unlike most systemic problems there is a clear path to minimizing this. Acknowledging this issue and yet not acting would be equivalent to if the government noticed that 300 kids were dying every year due to a lack of seat belts but decided that it was not a large enough issue to tackle. When considering human life all precautions should be taken to prevent death while maintaining freedoms.  When considering the third contention it is important to keep the statistics in mind. Of the 98 recent mass shootings where whether the gun was purchased legally or illegally is confirmed only about 16 percent of the cases involved the latter. While one should not assume that this means that we will see an 84 percent decline in mass shootings if we put in place the proposed ban it is logical to presume that these tragic events would occur at much lower rates than the status quo. Through the presented information it should be clear that assault weapons are unnecessarily dangerous and that normal people should not be able to acquire them the same way civilians are not permitted to assemble their own nuclear weapons. When America s Founding Fathers signed the U.S. Constitution they did not intend for the Second Amendment to allow mentally troubled teenagers to murder their classmates in cold blood rapists to shoot up churches or racists to open fire on vulnerable minorities. There is no reason to protect the unnecessarily violent assault weapons that lead to excessive death and suffering and America should take steps to get these guns off our streets. Hey my name is Dhruv Gupta and I m a 17 year old from California. I enjoy writing satire for YIP and also serve as the organization s Director of Technology. I also love to stay educated on the new and contentious topics. The discourse surrounding the welfare state in the US and the Western world writ large has undoubtedly shifted rightward since the 1980s. There are many reasons for this but the biggest one is the myth of welfare dependency. My goal here is to critically examine the concept of welfare dependency itself and challenge its characterization as a real issue. The purpose is not to deny that welfare fraud exists or that stealing is good but rather that government intervention to protect people and grow the economy is justified even if it costs more and that rightwing arguments on the topic are fundamentally flawed. One of Asia s most important diplomatic wars is being waged somewhere else entirely the South Pacific. Taiwan is on the defensive as China gradually wins over its allies with economic aid while the United States concerns itself with the struggle s implications for its own position in the region.

https://www.vox.com/2016/7/9/12128686/vox-gun-image-survey-ban-firearms, According to our research the types used in those very attacks. Vox and Morning Consult conducted a national survey in which 2000 people were asked whether they thought certain rifles handguns and shotguns should be legal based solely on the appearance of the gun. Participants were shown the names and pictures of 11 firearms and asked whether they thought the gun should be illegal then whether they thought it actually was illegal in the US. The results showed that a high majority of people about 70 percent were in favor of small handguns like the flare gun the .44 Magnum and the Taurus 605 being legal. The same could be said for the Golden Boy Rifle and the Montefeltro. However only a small minority 10 to 20 percent felt that assault weapons like the AK47 the Uzi and the MG3 should be legal. Perhaps unsurprisingly Republicans were more likely than Democrats to say that each gun should be legal by about 20 percentage points. For example about 80 percent of Republicans said the Golden Boy rifle should be legal compared with 59 percent of Democrats. Among Democrats 20 percent said all 11 guns should be illegal while 15 percent of Republicans said they should all be legal. Men overall were more likely to say each gun should be legal by about 10 percentage points. The second part of the survey asked respondents about the current legality of each gun. States have different rules when it comes to which firearms are banned for example the AK47 is legal to purchase in Idaho but illegal in California. Seven states California Connecticut Hawaii Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey and New York and the District of Columbia have laws banning the purchase or carrying of assault weapons. Minnesota and Virginia also regulate but do not ban assault weapons. For example someone who has committed a violent crime cannot buy an assault weapon in Minnesota regardless of whether the crime was committed in the state. AK47s Uzis and MG3s generally fall under such bans and regulations. When asked whether each gun was legal in the US most people polled were able to accurately say which handguns were legal but they were not as sure with rifles. Overall men were more familiar with the legality of each gun. Will you support Vox today?  We believe that everyone deserves to understand the world that they live in.

https://circuit-magazine.com/why-america-must-ban-assault-rifles/, Circuit Magazine I was a seventeenyear old military recruit when I was issued my first rifle. That marked the beginning of what would amount to nearly forty years of carrying firearms professionally.  Twentythree of those were in the military including nearly twenty years with the SAS followed by almost seventeen years of commercial security work. With the exception of my earliest military days when an NCO was constantly looking over my shoulder I was always responsible for the safety of my own weapons. From SAS operations to commercial security assignments I carried whatever firearms the tasks dictated. Sometimes that meant carrying three at once an assault rifle a submachine gun and a pistol.  I ve carried guns overtly and covertly all with a round in the chamber. I m a trained sniper and was a sniper commander. I m trained in close protection and hostage rescue including assaulting buildings trains aircraft and ships. I m trained in covert surveillance and combat field tracking skills I deployed extensively on operations and which tremendously enhanced my ability to be aware of my surroundings. I ve also instructed others around the world in all of these disciplines. As a private security advisor I worked in places like Iraq and Afghanistan where I carried concealed weapons including a pistol and assault rifle short under my clothing. I slept with a pistol under my pillow and the assault rifle laying alongside me. I was armed 247 because it was necessary especially when I was operating alone and outside of the security bubble of a military type base. I always viewed my weapon as an extension of my arm. It s a mindset. Because in order to protect myself and others in an environment that was hostile or threatening my weapon had to be with me round in the chamber at all times. You re probably thinking What a bloater! Sadly bloating is necessary when  wading into America s gun debate. A lot of people have a lot of opinions on how to tackle the epidemic of mass school shootings in America and most of those views are steeped in cultural bias social network propaganda and the babblings of blowhards on cable news outlets. My opinions are not based on propaganda and cultural preferences. They re informed by decades of personal experience handling firearms in mainly hostile situations.  Why do I care? Because I live in America and I have a child who goes to school here. I m having my say because if American gun laws don t change and radically so my child s life and the lives of millions of other children will continue to be in danger. In my informed opinion the only way to STOP mass school shootings in America is to ban the sale of assault rifles. It is the ONLY answer. Because as long as members of the public can get their hands on assault rifles schools will always be vulnerable to mass shootings.  Cue the outcry from socalled gun rights advocates. Those opposed to banning assault rifles usually fall back on that tired meme guns don t kill people people kill people! then pivot the conversation to mental illness. President Trump made that exact turn when tweeting about the mass school shooting in Parkland Florida.  Mental illness is undoubtedly a factor in many school shootings. And America s broken healthcare system allows alarming numbers of mentally ill individuals to go untreated. But improving services for the mentally ill will NOT stop mass shootings. Britain has many mentally ill individuals who can t get the proper treatment and support. But mass school shootings aren t a problem anymore in Britain because assault rifles aren t sold to the public. In America a mentally ill person can easily get their hands on an assault rifle either by purchasing one themselves or helping themselves to one purchased by a family member friend or someone else in the community. Cue the second and in my view more dangerous pivot by gun control advocates. Instead of banning assault rifles they argue we should arm teachers. Unbelievable as that may sound half a dozen states already allow it. President Trump thinks it s a great idea and said he d support using federal funds to offer rigorous firearms training to qualified school employees. This is a boneheaded idea and there s ample evidence to prove it. Like the teacher in Utah who accidentally shot herself in a faculty bathroom despite having completed a training course for carrying a concealed weapon. Or the teacher in Pennsylvania who left a loaded pistol in a bathroom used by children between the ages of 6 and 8.  Teachers can t be trusted to carry guns in schools responsibly because a lot of firearms training is little more than a tick in the box. That applies to both professional security and civilian training. Ever wonder why most members of the military and the police are not allowed to wander around with a weapon that has a round seated in the chamber? It s because their superiors are worried they ll have a negligent discharge fire accidentally if they get tired or distracted.  I ve witnessed a number of negligent discharges in conflict zones some of them while I was embedded with the US military. Some of these incidents were so shocking it was hard to believe that the individuals responsible had any weapons training at all. But they did have training. Military training.  Training didn t stop police on Capitol Hill from leaving their weapons behind in bathroom stalls. Or a sheriff in Michigan from leaving his gun in a school locker room. So much for the weapon being an extension of one s arm. And these are just two examples. The list goes on and on  Guns and especially assault rifles are dangerous because they re designed to kill people. Lots of people. Many professionals cannot be trusted to use them safely without supervision. That s why arming teachers is not the answer. They re far more likely to have a negligent discharge or leave their weapon in a public space or worse turn their weapon on a student whom they feel threatened by than actually use a firearm to protect students.  But the mindset in America is so skewed toward believing that guns make people safe that this horrible idea has found traction from the highest levels of government to the person on the street. Including my neighbours.  Some of the people who live on my block own assault rifles. When I ask them why they tell me they want to protect their families. But when I ask them where they keep their weapons they all tell me they re locked away in a gun safe.  To me that s about as useful as storing a fire extinguisher under lock and key. If a fire starts in your home you need to grab that extinguisher immediately to have any chance of putting out the flames. The same is true if you re attacked by an armed intruder. If your firearm is locked away you can t access it quickly which severely lowers your odds of successfully defending yourself and your family. My neighbours like most civilians in America who own assault rifles and other firearms aren t really protecting themselves and their families. They re just playing at it.  I ve spoken to many Americans of all ages and backgrounds since the mass school shooting in Parkland. The vast majority agree that America must ban assault rifles to prevent further carnage. They also agree that as a country they ve been far too lazy when it comes to questioning let alone challenging the status quo when it comes to safety in general. For example many Americans pull their cars into their driveways nose first which means they have to back out onto the road. This causes accidents every single day. When I ask people why no one does anything about this like pressure lawmakers to pass legislation making it illegal to back out onto a road no one has an answer. Except one honest neighbour who confessed it s probably down to laziness because it s just easier to pull into our driveways nose first.  Fortunately some of my neighbours have taken my advice and now park their cars in their driveways with the nose facing the road so they don t have to back out onto it. If that small change can happen on my street imagine what impact it would have if Americans started questioning en masse whether assault rifle ownership really makes anyone safe?  At least American children are getting impatient with the status quo. Fed up with mass shootings spawning the same predictable cable news brawls pitting conservatives against liberals American school kids are now organizing to make their voices heard. They ve been forced to advocate for themselves and their safety because their government and the voters responsible for holding that government to account have utterly failed to protect the nation s kids. Every child on the planet deserves to go to school and focus all of their energy and attention on learning. Instead American children are forced to endure lockdown drills to prepare for mass shootings. What kind of country has the United States become that the traumatized children of Parkland feel compelled to orchestrate nationwide walkouts and marches to press lawmakers to ban assault rifles?  That s why I m adding my voice to the chorus of voices calling for an assault rifle ban. Sadly given the NRA s financial hold over political elites I m not terribly hopeful that things will change in the near future. But that s no excuse for holding my tongue. I live in dread of the next mass shooting and the next one after that and the next one and the next one  The NRA may have deep pockets to buy politicians but you can t put a price on a child s life. That s why all the brave children walking out of classrooms and marching on Washington to demand change have my backing and unyielding respect. We should all listen to them because these amazing kids are leading America toward a safer better future.

Djea3 December 30 2019 at 521 AM This is BUNK. Anyone reading this article on tis site already knows there is NO SUCH THING as an assault rifle. There are many types of rifles and rifle actions however PEOPLE assault rifles do not. It truly is that simple. The most common armed assault in the USA is possibly armed police officers doing their duty . Consider that thought a moment. I certainly do not want police to have any arms not allowed the public. There would be no justification for that at all. The real issue here in the USA is that the leftists want to take away all gun rights and as in every country .the moment gun rights are taken then the government WILL become overbearing. There have been no reduction in gun crime from illegal gun ownership over the last 50 years of severe restrictions of legal ownership of guns.  Those of you not from the USA possibly do not understand that the FOUNDING FATHERS in the USA fought England at its PRIME and WON. The Second Amendment is NOT about rifles or pistols it states ARMS. Those of you who have been in military service KNOW and understand that the term ARMS includes virtually every weapon of war and every weapon of war was owned by the Founding Fathers!. The Founding Fathers were clear in their arguments and letters that the PURPOSE of bearing arms was NOT about self protection that was a given. The true purpose was so that the PEOPLE themselves could rise up against any overbearing government whose foot was on their neck as well as protect themselves from foreign invasions. Furthermore the Founding fathers specifically stated that this right to bear arms is INALIENABLE This means that NO law can be made to take away that right. Now someone here is foolishly writing something about an assault weapon and how they should be banned. All I can say is I wish the author was in Russia or China or any of fifty other countries when the Communists and fascists took over or even Nazi Germany when guns were taken. Any government that takes weapons from the people by historic evidence and fact is going to harm those people directly. The Foot of that government WILL be on the neck of the people possibly not today but the government has HUMANS to run it therefore it will happen.
