RTX Video HDR adds a new AIenhanced feature to all GeForce RTX GPUs instantly converting any Standard Dynamic Range SDR video playing in internet browsers into vibrant High Dynamic Range HDR. HDR enables stunning video quality but is not widely used online because of the extra work required. Using the power of Tensor Cores on GeForce RTX GPUs RTX Video HDR allows GeForce RTX GPU owners to maximize their HDR panel s ability to display more vivid dynamic colors preserving intricate details that may be inadvertently rendered unidentifiable due to video compression. RTX Video HDR and RTX Video Super Resolution can be used together to produce the clearest livestreamed video anywhere anytime. The combined features work on Chromiumbased browsers such as Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge Mozilla Firefox and the VLC media player via the RTX branch. When setting up their broadcasts most Twitch streamers must choose between a higher resolution output or reliable streaming to more devices. Highquality video provides more enjoyable viewing experiences but causes streams to buffer for viewers with low bandwidth. Streaming lowerquality video allows more people to watch the content seamlessly but introduces artifacts and renders content at a lower resolution. Twitch offers serverside transcoding for topperforming channels meaning different versions of the same stream will be created for different bandwidth levels improving the viewing experience. However many channels are left with a single stream option. Twitch OBS and NVIDIA have collaborated on a new feature to address this problem Twitch Enhanced Broadcasting releasing in beta later this month. With this new feature GeForce RTX GPU owners will be able to broadcast up to three streams simultaneously an increase to five encodes is planned for a later release. In future updates Twitch will test higherinput bit rates as well as new codecs which will enable streamers to broadcast at up to 4K at 60 frames per second for the first time. The new codecs include the latestgeneration AV1 for GeForce RTX 40 Series GPUs which provides 40 more encoding efficiency than H.264 and HEVC for previousgeneration GeForce GPUs.

He received his M.A. in journalism from The New School and his B.A. in history and political science from McGill University.  Update April 22 2024 For todays live markets news see here.  A dramatic tech selloff sent the S P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lower for the sixth consecutive day while buoyant financials and consumer staples stocks lifted the Dow.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.6 Friday to finish the week flat. The S P 500 slid 0.9 ending the week down 3.1 its biggest decline in more than a year. The Nasdaq Composite tumbled 2.1 to close out the week 5.5 lower its worst performance since November 2022.  In corporate news Super Micro Computer SMCI stock tumbled after the company chose not to preannounce its firstquarter earnings which its done in seven of the last eight quarters stoking concerns the earnings will disappoint. Netflix NFLX reported a surge in new subscribers in the first quarter but its currentquarter revenue guidance missed analyst estimates and shares slumped.  Bitcoin rose to trade above 64000 ahead of the first bitcoin halving in four years.  Stocks ended Thursday mixed with the Dow eking out a small gain while the S P 500 gave up early gains to close lower for the fourth consecutive day. Stock Indexes Wrap Nvidia Chip Stocks Tumble as Financials Staples Advance  American Express AXP jumped 6.2 after reporting betterthanexpected firstquarter earnings and net interest income. Peers in the financial sector also rose including JPMorgan Chase JPM up 2.5 and Travelers Companies TRV up 1.7.   Procter Gamble PG ticked up 0.5 after topping Wall Streets estimates with its firstquarter earnings.  The Dow s priceweighting insulated it from the effects of a tech selloff that sank some of its largest components. Amazon AMZN fell 2.6 Microsoft MSFT shed 1.3 and Apple AAPL lost 1.2.   Paramount Global PARA shares jumped 13.4 amid reports Sony Pictures was in talks with Apollo Global Management to make a joint takeover bid for the entertainment company.  Fifth Third Bancorp FITB rose 5.9 after reporting its earnings fell less than analysts expected in the first quarter.   Super Micro Computer SMCI tumbled 23.1 after it skipped previewing its firstquarter earnings something its done in seven of the last eight quarters raising concerns about slowing growth.   Nvidia NVDA led a semiconductor selloff falling 10 to notch its lowest close since February and its worst single day since March 2020.  Jabil JBL fell 8.4 after the company said it had placed CEO Kenneth Wilson on paid administrative leave amid an internal investigation of corporate policies.   SLB SLB slipped 2.2 after reporting a decline in North American revenue in the first quarter.   Tesla TLSA fell 1.9 after the company recalled nearly 4000 Cybertrucks to repair faulty accelerator pedals.  Intuitive Surgical ISRG got caught up in the selloff despite beating earnings estimates.

Micron MU and Broadcom AVGO lost 4.6 and 4.3 respectively.   Meta META slipped 4.1 amid the tech selloff. Super Micro Stock Tumbles as Skipped Earnings Preview Stokes Growth Concerns  The recent slide in the stock price of Super Micro Computer SMCI accelerated Friday as the artificial intelligence AI darling spooked investors by not preannouncing its March quarter results.  The AI hardware maker also known as Supermicro has released a preliminary financial report in seven of the last eight quarters usually providing estimates ahead of its previous outlook. However on Friday the company simply announced that it will report thirdquarter fiscal 2024 results on April 30.  Shares plunged more than 22 on Friday to trade at 717 their lowest since early February. Still thanks to its meteoric rise earlier in the year the stock was up more than 150 so far this year.  Bill McColl  Nvidia s market cap fell below 2 trillion on Friday afternoon amid a tech selloff that hit semiconductor stocks particularly hard.   The AI chip leader s shares fell as much as 7.3 to trade below 800 the 2 trillion threshold for Nvidia which has 2.5 billion outstanding shares. Though even with Fridays losses the company still stood as the thirdmost valuable company in the U.S. ahead of both Alphabet GOOGL and Amazon AMZN.  Nvidia s market cap first topped 2 trillion on February 23 just 270 days after it surpassed 1 trillion. Shares continued to climb into late March when they topped out at 950 giving the company a market value of nearly 2.4 trillion.   Nvidia and other tech stocks have wavered this month as strong economic data and a slew of hotterthanexpected inflation reports have forced markets and policymakers to lower their expectations for the interest rate cuts this year.   Nvidia was followed lower by semiconductor peers Advanced Micro Devices AMD and Micron MU both of which were down more than 4 Friday afternoon.  Tesla TSLA has ordered a voluntary recall of almost 4000 Cybertrucks after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NHTSA found an issue with the vehicles accelerator pedal.  When high force is applied to the pad on the accelerator pedal the pad may dislodge which may cause the pedal to become trapped in the interior trim above the pedal the NHTSA said. It noted that if that happens the performance and operation of the pedal will be affected which may increase the risk of a collision.   Regulators explained that the pads likely came loose as soap used as a lubricant in the vehicle assembly process prevented them from remaining stuck to the pedal.  A total of 3878 Cybertrucks are involved in the recall including all that were manufactured between November 13 and April 4.   Tesla shares were down about 0.6 at 149.1 Friday afternoon. They have lost about 40 of their value this year.  Bill McColl  Shares of Bitcoin miners rose on Friday ahead of a hotly anticipated halving.   Marathon Digital MARA Cleanspark CLSK and Riot Platforms RIOT three of the largest publicly traded miners were all up about 8 early Friday afternoon.   The upcoming halving will as the name suggests cut the reward for mining bitcoin in half. That may not be as bad for miners as it sounds. Halving because it slows the rate at which new bitcoin is minted has the potential to boost prices. It has also historically increased adoption of bitcoin. Both outcomes would benefit miners helping to offset the halving s downside.   There are also several ways miners can make up for the lost revenue. Miners can charge higher transaction fees which up to now have represented a sliver of their overall revenue. Some miners are also exploring energy harvesting which would involve generating their own electricity and selling the byproducts.  Paramount Jumps as Sony Apollo Reportedly Consider a Joint Bid for the Media Giant   Paramount Global PARA shares soared close to 8 in early trading Friday after The New York Times reported that Sony Group s SONY studio division was in talks with Apollo Global Management about joining a bid for the media giant.  The two companies have not submitted an official bid according to the report as Paramount is still in exclusive merger conversations with Skydance Media.  The potential deal with Skydance has received significant investor pushback while Paramount had initially rejected Apollo s initial offer to buy the company for more than 26 billion including debt amid questions about the investment firms financing.  Shares of Paramount were up 8.3 to 11.88 midday Friday. Even with Friday s gains they ve lost close to 20 of their value since the start of 2024.  Fatima Attarwala American Express Posts Earnings Beat Affirms 2024 Growth Projections  American Express AXP shares rose on Friday after the credit card provider reported firstquarter revenue and profit that came in above analyst expectations and affirmed its fullyear growth guidance for 2024.  American Express reported revenue of 15.8 billion just above consensus analyst estimates compiled by Visible Alpha of 15.76 billion. Net income of 2.44 billion and diluted earnings per share EPS of 3.33 were well above estimates of 2.17 billion and 2.96 per share respectively.  Unlike several of its peers in the finance industry that reported lower net interest income than expected in recent earnings reports American Express posted 3.77 billion of profit in the metric ahead of expectations of 3.66 billion.  American Express affirmed its fullyear guidance for fiscal 2024 projecting yearoveryear revenue growth of 9 to 11 and EPS of 12.65 to 13.15.  American Express shares initially fell 2 in premarket trading following the earnings report s release before reversing course and were up about 4 at 226 Friday morning. The stock has gained about 20 so far this year.  Aaron McDade Why Netflix s Blockbuster Q1 Earnings Subscriber Growth Failed To Power Its Stock  Netflix NFLX reported betterthanexpected revenue and earnings for the first quarter as its subscriber growth surged. And yet it was one of the worstperforming stocks in the S P 500 Friday morning as markets focused on its revenue guidance.  The streaming company s subscribers grew 16 yearoveryear to 269.6 million adding 9.33 million new paying customers in the three months ending March. After a lull in 2022 Netflix has seen its subscriber base growth even after implementing a password crackdown.  Netflix posted net income of 2.33 billion or 5.28 per diluted share. Revenue grew 14.8 to 9.37 billion much higher than analyst expectations.  The company forecast revenue would grow 16 to 9.49 billion in the second quarter just shy of the 9.5 billion forecast by analysts polled by Visible Alpha.  Netflix also projected its income would decline from the first quarter. Net Income is expected to come in at 2.06 billion down from the 2.33 billion reported in the first quarter while earnings per share EPS is expected to fall to 4.68 from 5.28.  Netflix shares were down more than 6 at 572.61 Friday morning. Though after surging on its fourthquarter earnings report the stock is still up more than 17 so far this year.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/04/02/buy-four-big-tech-stocks---nvidia-meta-microsoft-amazon---sell-apple-and-tesla/, What makes stock prices go up and down? My guess is it all depends on how a company performs compared to investor expectations. When it comes to the the seven biggest tech stocks propelling the S P 500 this hypothesis holds up well when examining their performance in the first three months of 2024. The socalled fab four Nvidia Meta Platforms FB Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN outpaced the market after reporting expectationsbeating growth. Shares of two of the other three Apple and Tesla have lost ground in the first quarter according to the Wall Street Journal. Here s how those four stocks performed in the first quarter compared to the S P 500 which rose 10.7 The other two lost ground. I am leaving out Alphabet the seventh company. Here is how poorly they fared There seems to be a relationship between how each of these companies performed relative to expectations in their most recent financial report and their stock price trajectories. Consider buying companies from these lists you think will exceed expectations and raise their guidance when they next report quarterly results. Conversely consider selling shares of the companies you expect to fall short of investor expectations. Nvidia Meta Amazon and Microsoft did better than expectations. The relative performance of their stock prices in the first quarter seems to sync with their revenue growth. Nvidia defied the pessimists when it reported results for the quarter ending January 2024 I wrote in a February 2024 Forbes post. After reporting fasterthanexpected growth in the previous quarter and raising guidance for the current one investors sent Nvidia stock up more than 14 in offhours trading on February 21. Nvidia s stock continued to rise for the rest of the first quarter of 2024. When it reports results in May the stock could come crashing down unless the chip maker exceeds that 300 growth forecast. Meta with a 29 net margin in 2023 grew faster and offered better guidance than Amazon did. Meta also initiated a 50 cents per share dividend I wrote in a February 2024 Forbes post comparing the performance of the two tech giants. Amazon which generated a 17 net margin last year is growing more slowly but catching up in Generative AI I wrote in the same February 2024 Forbes post mentioned above. Both companies cut costs. Meta cut 22 of its people ending 2023 with 67317 employees noted IBD. Amazon laid off roughly 27000 employees a year ago ending 2023 slightly below the yearearlier level of 1.53 million according to the Wall Street Journal. Microsoft s guidance for the current quarter fell short even as the company beat earnings expectations due to rapid growth in its Azure unit according to CNBC. Results were also helped by Microsoft s acquisition of video game publisher Activision ATVI Blizzard I wrote in a January 2024 Forbes post. Apple and Tesla delivered disappointing results for investors and their share prices fell. As I wrote in a January 2024 Forbes post Tesla issued a weak fourth quarter report and delivered belowexpectations guidance for 2024. While Tesla s revenue was up the vehicle maker fell short of expectations while its operating margin dropped significantly and the company forecast lower growth. Here are the key numbers The drumbeat of bad Tesla news persisted with the company s April 2 report of weak first quarter deliveries of 386810 vehicles which was substantially below analyst consensus estimate of 449080 noted an email from investment manager Louis Navellier. Competition from BYD and Li Auto meant both companies captured Chinese market share from Tesla. With Tesla s Model 3 and Model Y accounting for 96 of Tesla s firstquarter deliveries pressure on Tesla to introduce its Model 2 became imperative noted Navellier. Meanwhile a Wall Street analyst forecast Apple revenue could drop for the first time since 2016 when it reports in May. Ananda Baruah an analyst at Loop Capital cut his earnings estimates for the iPhonemaker reported Quartz. Baruah forecasts Apple s iPhone revenue for the March 2024ending quarter will total 44 billion while estimating the company s total revenue to fall 3.2 billion below Wall Street s forecast of 91 billion Quartz noted. Underlying Baruah s bearish forecast were low iPhone unit shipments due to declining organic demand and stronger competition along with flattening average selling prices. With Apple depending heavily on the Chinese smartphone market the company was hurt by the 7 decline in demand in China and the resurgence of rival Huawei which released a new series of smartphones reported Quartz. If Baruah is correct Apple would fall way short of Wall Street expectations. He wrote that Wall Street forecasts for iPhone unit sales and revenue could be 20 too high while Wall Street expectations for the company s overall revenue and earnings per share could be 10 higher than what Apple he expects to achieve per the Quartz report. The lesson for investors is simple in concept Bet on companies that grow the fastest by getting the most innovative products to market before their rivals do. The hard part is that some of the fastestgrowing companies have raised investor expectations so high that their shares could plunge if they cannot keep setting the bar ever higher.,

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/nvidia-announces-gb200-blackwell-ai-chip-launching-later-this-year.html, Nvidia on Monday announced a new generation of artificial intelligence chips and software for running artificial intelligence models. The announcement made during Nvidia s developer s conference in San Jose comes as the chipmaker seeks to solidify its position as the goto supplier for AI companies. Nvidia s share price is up fivefold and total sales have more than tripled since OpenAI s ChatGPT kicked off the AI boom in late 2022. Nvidia s highend server GPUs are essential for training and deploying large AI models. Companies like Microsoft and Meta have spent billions of dollars buying the chips. The new generation of AI graphics processors is named Blackwell. The first Blackwell chip is called the GB200 and will ship later this year. Nvidia is enticing its customers with more powerful chips to spur new orders. Companies and software makers for example are still scrambling to get their hands on the current generation of Hopper H100s and similar chips.  Hopper is fantastic but we need bigger GPUs Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said on Monday at the company s developer conference in California.  Nvidia shares fell more than 1 in extended trading on Monday.  The company also introduced revenuegenerating software called NIM that will make it easier to deploy AI giving customers another reason to stick with Nvidia chips over a rising field of competitors. Nvidia executives say that the company is becoming less of a mercenary chip provider and more of a platform provider like Microsoft or Apple on which other companies can build software.  Blackwell s not a chip it s the name of a platform Huang said.   The sellable commercial product was the GPU and the software was all to help people use the GPU in different ways said Nvidia enterprise VP Manuvir Das in an interview. Of course we still do that. But what s really changed is we really have a commercial software business now.  Das said Nvidia s new software will make it easier to run programs on any of Nvidia s GPUs even older ones that might be better suited for deploying but not building AI.  If you re a developer you ve got an interesting model you want people to adopt if you put it in a NIM we ll make sure that it s runnable on all our GPUs so you reach a lot of people Das said. Every two years Nvidia updates its GPU architecture unlocking a big jump in performance. Many of the AI models released over the past year were trained on the company s Hopper architecture used by chips such as the H100 which was announced in 2022. Nvidia says Blackwellbased processors like the GB200 offer a huge performance upgrade for AI companies with 20 petaflops in AI performance versus 4 petaflops for the H100. The additional processing power will enable AI companies to train bigger and more intricate models Nvidia said. The chip includes what Nvidia calls a transformer engine specifically built to run transformersbased AI one of the core technologies underpinning ChatGPT. The Blackwell GPU is large and combines two separately manufactured dies into one chip manufactured by TSMC. It will also be available as an entire server called the GB200 NVLink 2 combining 72 Blackwell GPUs and other Nvidia parts designed to train AI models. Amazon Google Microsoft and Oracle will sell access to the GB200 through cloud services. The GB200 pairs two B200 Blackwell GPUs with one Armbased Grace CPU. Nvidia said Amazon Web Services would build a server cluster with 20000 GB200 chips. Nvidia said that the system can deploy a 27trillionparameter model. That s much larger than even the biggest models such as GPT4 which reportedly has 1.7 trillion parameters. Many artificial intelligence researchers believe bigger models with more parameters and data could unlock new capabilities. Nvidia didn t provide a cost for the new GB200 or the systems it s used in. Nvidia s Hopperbased H100 costs between 25000 and 40000 per chip with whole systems that cost as much as 200000 according to analyst estimates. Nvidia also announced it s adding a new product named NIM which stands for Nvidia Inference Microservice to its Nvidia enterprise software subscription. NIM makes it easier to use older Nvidia GPUs for inference or the process of running AI software and will allow companies to continue to use the hundreds of millions of Nvidia GPUs they already own. Inference requires less computational power than the initial training of a new AI model. NIM enables companies that want to run their own AI models instead of buying access to AI results as a service from companies like OpenAI. The strategy is to get customers who buy Nvidiabased servers to sign up for Nvidia enterprise which costs 4500 per GPU per year for a license. Nvidia will work with AI companies like Microsoft or Hugging Face to ensure their AI models are tuned to run on all compatible Nvidia chips. Then using a NIM developers can efficiently run the model on their own servers or cloudbased Nvidia servers without a lengthy configuration process.  In my code where I was calling into OpenAI I will replace one line of code to point it to this NIM that I got from Nvidia instead Das said. Nvidia says the software will also help AI run on GPUequipped laptops instead of on servers in the cloud.
