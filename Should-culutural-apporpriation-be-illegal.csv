https://oneill.law.georgetown.edu/the-debate-about-cultural-appropriation/, Mehgan Gallagher  A simple definition of cultural appropriation is the idea of someone adopting something from a culture that is not their own. At first glance it appears that this is a harmless act. Well think again. A deeper understanding of what cultural appropriation is digs up issues of whether it is offensive and even racist. The idea of cultural appropriation generally involves a power dynamic and an unfair balance of power in which the appropriated culture has a history of being systematically oppressed by the dominating appropriating culture.A prime example of this power dynamic is the Washington Redskins NFL team which has been accused of cultural appropriation particularly their mascot of an American Indian wearing a headdress. American Indians have a long history of being mistreated and pushed off their land by white settlers in the United States thus the use of the name along with the mascot serves as a harsh reminder of the years of oppression and mistreatment suffered by American Indians. The term Redskin is particularly offensive because of its origins. There are debates about its origin but everyone agrees that it is offensive. One explanation dates back to a time in history when colonial and state governments paid white people to kill Native Americans and were encouraged to cut off their scalps and even genitalia red skins to prove their Indian kill. In this context it is understandable why this term would be offensive to native peoples. There are websites designed specifically to bring attention to this issue. One in particular is called Native Appropriations and is dedicated to providing a forum to show how many American Indian Alaska Native Native Hawaiian First Nations and other Indigenous Peoples disapprove of the Redskins in an initiative called Natives Against Redskns. The American Psychological Association APA recommends retiring the use of American Indian mascots altogether. Studies have found that the stereotypical images are harmful to the selfesteem and development of American Indian students and that the portrayals have a negative effect on all students.Urban Dictionary takes a completely different stance on the subject and defines cultural appropriation as The ridiculous notion that being of a different culture or race especially white means that you are not allowed to adopt things from other cultures. This does nothing but support segregation and hinder progress in the world. All it serves to do is to promote segregation and racism. So this begs the question does the idea of cultural appropriation help or hinder racism and segregation and is a dominant culture s adoption of another s culture inherently racist?There is a big debate about this. There is also a large spectrum of what is considered to be cultural appropriation. For some people white Americans walking around in traditional east African garb for example is considered cultural appropriation. Others would argue it is a form of selfexpression and shows appreciation and respect of another culture. Alternatively a white American wearing a sari to a traditional Indian wedding ceremony is considered by many not to be cultural appropriation but instead is showing respect of the culture and tradition.There are many other examples of cultural appropriation in mainstream media. The KardashianJenners reality television stars and designers have often been criticized for cultural appropriation. Kylie Jenner for example has been called out on social media for posting a picture with her hair braided in cornrows a popular hairstyle among black men and women. More recently Kendall Jenner was highly criticized for a Pepsi commercial she starred in that critics say trivialized commercialized and semiwhitewashed movements such as Black Lives Matter. Kendall and Kylie were also targeted when their clothing line produced tshirts with printed photos of dead rappers Biggie Smalls and Tupac Shakur with images of the sisters overlaid on the top. It seems the debate often comes down to one s intention and whether one is intending to appreciate the culture they are adopting or intending to mock or belittle it. However it isn t always that simple. It can be argued that many of the examples people use to define cultural appropriation did not intend to offend. So the real question should be whether someone from the culture that is being appropriated would be offended by the demonstration of their culture. For example if a white American male is debating whether or not to buy a tshirt with an American Indian in a headdress on the front he should ask himself if he thinks an American Indian would be offended by the shirt or better yet he should ask an American Indian what he finds the shirt offensive of his culture.

https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/north/cultural-appropriation-make-it-illegal-worldwide-indigenous-advocates-say-1.4157943, Delegates from 189 countries including Canada are in Geneva this week as part of a specialized international committee within the World Intellectual Property Organization WIPO a United Nations agency. Since it began in 2001 the committee has been working on creating and finishing three pieces of international law that would expand intellectualproperty regulations to protect things like Indigenous designs dances words and traditional medicines. The meeting takes place as concern grows worldwide about the rights of cultures to control their own materials. In the U.S. this week designer Tory Burch agreed to change the description of one of her coats for women after Romanians protested that it had been described as Africaninspired when it actually appropriated a traditional Romanian garment. Speaking to the committee Monday James Anaya dean of law at the University of Colorado said the UN s negotiated document should obligate states to create effective criminal and civil enforcement procedures to recognize and prevent the nonconsensual taking and illegitimate possession sale and export of traditional cultural expressions.  Anaya said the document should also look at products that are falsely advertised as Indigenousmade or endorsed by Indigenous groups. That would mean products like those in U.S.based retailer Urban Outfitters Navajo line Anaya said including Navajo hipster panties a peace treaty feather necklace and a Navajo print flask.  The Navajo Nation launched a legal battle against the company for trademark infringement in 2012. The case was settled out of court late last year. Anaya is one of several Indigenous leaders at this round of negotiations who are questioning just how seriously some member states are taking the negotiations. The committee has been working on three draft documents for 16 years and member states are now going through them line by line. It is a painstaking slow process and some Indigenous leaders say they are frustrated and disenchanted about the committee s future.  We are only halfway through 2017 and yet the number of occurrences of misappropriation happening to Indigenous Peoples in all regions of the world seems relentless with no relief in sight said Aroha Te Pareake Mead a member of the Ngati Awa and Ngati Porou tribes in Wellington New Zealand.   We asked the international community to help deal with a problem that traverses international boundaries and are still waiting.  Mead said part of the problem is that Indigenous groups around the world have no idea about the committee s work and often aren t being consulted by member states.  People at a national level don t know what s going on and there aren t many processes where you can get information about this or contribute to the positions that are being taken here.  Mead also noted that WIPO has what she called one of the lowest rates of Indigenous participation.  The issues being discussed at the Intergovernmental Committee are also being discussed in Indigenous organizations and communities all around the world on a regular basis. So why are there not more Indigenous representatives here?  There are Indigenous groups from around the world taking part in this round of negotiations including groups from New Zealand Kenya Mexico Colombia and the United States. There is no Indigenous representation in the Canadian delegation. Officials with Global Affairs Canada Innovation Science and Economic Development Canada and Canadian Heritage are taking part in this round of negotiations but the lack of Canadian Indigenous representatives is drawing criticism from the Assembly of First Nations.  The elders and knowledge keepers are the authorities who should oversee the creation of guidelines and a process for utilizing Indigenous knowledge in any activities Assembly of First Nations National Chief Perry Bellegarde told CBC in a written statement.  We welcome the investigation of such topics on an international stage like the United Nations but it s crucial that Indigenous knowledge keepers are part of the dialogue.  There was no word on whether the federal government plans to consult with the AFN after this round of negotiations wraps up on Friday. Hilary Bird is a reporter with CBC North in Yellowknife.

As codified in the 1976 Copyright Revision Act the fair use doctrine s fourpart test is supposed to help fact finders determine the reasonableness of an unauthorized appropriation. But while the fair use test has evolved to address questions about the purpose behind an appropriation the amount and substance of the work used and the effects of the appropriation on the market for the work the vital inquiry about the nature of the original work and the impact of unauthorized appropriation on its creative environment has been all but forgotten by lower federal courts. Combining doctrinal analysis settlercolonial theory and ethnographic fieldwork involving ongoing appropriations of copyrightable Indigenous culture this Article shows how the forgotten factor in the fair use analysis is key to assessing the real impacts unauthorized appropriations have on culturally diverse forms of creativity. Thus if we are committed to the development of creativity in all of its varieties and natures a rehabilitation of the forgotten factor is both urgent and necessary. In 2019 the Los Angelesbased fashion retailer MadHappy began selling sweatshirts featuring a remarkable new design. Alongside a MadHappy logo on the arm of the sweatshirt the front of the sweatshirts displayed a circular rainbow with two psychedelically colored cornstalks shaped into a crest that enclosed four multicolored mountains bearing the names of Aspen Colorado ski resorts.2 Not long after the sweatshirts appeared in the Instagram feeds of celebrities a Twitter storm from the Navajo Nation erupted chiding the retailer for appropriating what was immediately recognized as the Nation s official seal.3 The seal s design an original twodimensional graphic work created in 1952 by Tribal member John Claw Jr. is a cultural icon that according to the Tribe remains under copyright.4 This latter consideration seems to have convinced MadHappy to stop production divert proceeds from sales of the shirts to the Navajo Nation and agree to undertake cultural sensitivity training for its staff.5  This instance of cultural appropriation ultimately ended amicably. But what result can Navajo Nation and other Indigenous peoples6 expect in future copyright disputes should they be forced to litigate to protect their culture from unauthorized exploitation?7 The answer to this question turns in part on whether courts will consider appropriations like MadHappy s to be infringements or will sanction them under equitable legal doctrines like fair use.  Debates surrounding the unauthorized appropriation of Indigenous peoples intangible culture songs dance forms oral histories designs by those with power or privilege have been slowly unsettling the foundations of American copyright law for decades.8 A growing stream of scholarship and news reports documenting cultural appropriations from the seemingly innocent to the more intentional and obscene have raised concern nationally and internationally leading in some cases to protests and other forms of direct action.9 In response legal scholars working to theorize cultural rights have articulated what Indigenous peoples have intuited for centuries that cultural appropriation functions as an extension of Europeansettler conquest which has systematically dispossessed Indigenous communities of their lands natural resources family relationships identities and even their own bodies.10  Congress has failed to adequately curtail unauthorized appropriations of Indigenous cultural expressions and other forms of intellectual property despite its duty to protect Native American Tribes within its jurisdiction.11 To be sure Congress has provided some limited solutions to curb appropriation or desecration of tangible objects that are culturally important to federally recognized Indian tribes hereinafter Tribes .12 And Congress enacted a truth in advertising law the Indian Arts and Crafts Act which prohibits selling and displaying arts and crafts or Indian Products while falsely suggesting they are Indian made.13 But there are currently no federal laws other than copyright that prohibit the appropriation of Indigenous songs dances or other forms of Indigenous cultural expression. This is despite emerging global consensus that such forms of cultural expression should be protected from appropriation absent the free prior and informed consent of the Indigenous groups who created them.14 Scholars have proposed a number of ways to remedy harmful cultural appropriations. Some have looked to human rights principles treaties and customary international law as a basis for protecting Indigenous culture from nonIndigenous exploitation.15 However the United States has yet to ratify any of the international treaties specifically protecting intangible Indigenous culture. Others have advocated for the creation of new property frameworks or the adaptation of existing ones under domestic law to provide Indigenous groups enforceable rights against those who misuse their expressive cultures.16 These innovative proposals however have yet to be fully taken up by Congress or the federal courts. While a comprehensive solution for protecting Indigenous culture from unauthorized exploitation remains elusive a number of scholars have suggested that existing copyright law may provide Indigenous groups some limited rights to remedy misuses of cultural materials they or their members own.17 Copyright protects the original expressions of authors e.g. books music movies fine art dance and other forms of culture from unauthorized appropriation by granting copyright holders an enforceable property right to govern their use.18 But a number of exceptions limit the right in part to ensure that culture is not completely locked up for future creators.19 Determining copyright liability in instances of cultural appropriation from Indigenous peoples then requires robust analysis and careful balancing of Indegenous peoples interests in protecting their cultural contributions from misappropriation and the interests of society in having access to Indigenous culture.20 To date while neither Congress nor the courts have dealt with the application of copyright law to Native Americans specific forms of cultural creativity21 both have provided several general mechanisms to assist in weighing the interests of copyright holders against the public s interest in access to culture.22 Foremost among these is copyright law s fair use doctrine which functions as a gatekeeping mechanism of sorts for unauthorized appropriations of culture. When assessing the fairness of an unauthorized appropriation of another s copyrighted work courts generally apply a statutorily prescribed fourfactor test.23 Courts must examine the purpose and character of the use to determine how compelling the case is for the use in light of copyright s overarching goal of promoting the progress of science and the useful arts. 24 Also courts must consider carefully the effect of the appropriation upon the potential market for the original work assessing the economic harms an unauthorized use may inflict on the current copyright owner.25 Additionally courts will weigh the amount and substantiality of the work used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole sometimes performing a line by line comparison of the original work to the purportedly infringing copy to see precisely how much quantitatively and qualitatively has been appropriated.26 Finally courts must also inquire into the nature of the copyrighted work what I call here the forgotten factor. 27 While the other factors ask questions such as who is appropriating a work why they are doing it how much they are appropriating and how the appropriation will affect the market for the work the forgotten factor asks what is being appropriated its creative or intellectual values and whether allowing the appropriation would stifle future creativity.28 Though the forgotten factor s utility was substantial enough for Congress to include it in the Copyright Act the factor has rarely played a significant role in the determination of a fair use dispute particularly in isolation from the other fair use factors.29 This is likely either the consequence of the factor being only superficially discussed and little understood 30 or it may also reflect how courts often construe the factor narrowly as only encompassing two somewhat limited and largely duplicative considerations.31 Whatever the reason the factor has been all but erased from the fair use analysis in some circuits. This Article argues that the forgotten factor has the potential to play a pivotal role in providing more robust protections to copyrightable Indigenous works in the fair use analysis by requiring factfinders to consider what a work is from the point of view of the community that creates it. Rather than forgetting this factor as some courts have done I propose reclaiming it in a manner consistent with both the fair use doctrine s ultimate purpose of fostering cultural progress and the need for copyright law to support the production of culture in all its diversity of forms and natures.32 This entails reconceptualizing the factor s inquiry into the nature of a work as an ontological one situating the work within its creative context and determining what impact if any unauthorized use of the work might have on this kind of creativity going forward. Thus to help courts better determine whether a particular unauthorized use is fair the inquiry should direct a court to inquire into 1 the creative environment from which the work has been produced and 2 the potential impact of unauthorized appropriation on that creative environment. Such a methodological change necessarily involves displacing the current distinctions relied on in most courts analyses published vs. unpublished factual vs. creative . As I explain not only have these distinctions been considerably narrowed by Congress and the courts they also tend to privilege Europeandescended cultural forms and their creativeindustrial complexes. The hope is that this shift will ultimately protect and catalyze creative growth across a much broader spectrum of cultural economies both Indigenous and nonIndigenous. At the same time this is admittedly a small contribution to resolving the overarching problem of cultural appropriation which should ideally be addressed through congressional consultation with Indigenous and other marginalized peoples and subsequent legislative interventions. But a reclamation of the forgotten factor now should make fair use a more equitable gatekeeping device for unauthorized uses of culture particularly that of Indigenous peoples. This Article proceeds in four parts. In Part I I examine the current stakes of cultural appropriation for Indigenous peoples placing cultural appropriation within the broader project of settlercolonialism and Indigenous struggles for cultural sovereignty. In doing so I highlight through a series of case studies how copyright despite its current constitutional limitations might still be helpful for Indigenous peoples seeking to combat cultural appropriation. In Part II I discuss the fair use doctrine and its gatekeeping function for instances of cultural appropriation. I examine the historical importance of the forgotten factor showing that this factor far from being insignificant played a crucial role in complex cases involving the value of a work within its creative environment. In Part III I offer a new approach to the forgotten factor that may provide a more robust analysis in instances of cultural appropriation and apply that factor to the case studies discussed in Part I. Before proceeding a few caveats are in order. First it goes without saying that cultural appropriation impacts intellectual property interests of many diverse ethnic racial religious and other minority groups.33 This Article focuses specifically on the ways cultural appropriation affects the creative social economic and political interests of Indigenous peoples and resists attempting to provide a global solution to all forms of cultural appropriation.34 Second this Article focuses on the appropriation of copyrightable cultural products and processes. It does not attempt to resolve the thorny issue of what James O. Young has termed subject appropriation or the appropriation of cultural identities.35 While copyright s subject matter encompasses some aspects of an individual s or group s personhood or peoplehood36 the use of offensive caricatures or stereotypes of racial groups as sports mascots37 or the names of deceased tribal leaders on products which they would have found repugnant38 are modes of appropriation that have been more thoroughly debated within the domains of trademark and rights to privacy and publicity. Finally this Article presumes that copyright law applies at least to some extent on Tribal lands a presumption that is far from certain and which I leave for future writing.39 Many tribes maintain and enforce laws customs and protocols governing the circulation and reproduction of culture that derive from authorities the United States Constitution cannot reach.40 Whether Congress s assumed plenary power over Indigenous peoples could ever extinguish preempt or limit the inherent sovereignty of Indigenous peoples to govern the production use and circulation of culture remains a deeply contested issue even today. Unauthorized cultural appropriation subsumes a wide variety of activities within its ambit each involving some sort of transfer or use of something socially valuable to those who from a particular point of view should not be entitled to it.41 Culture remains for many Indigenous peoples the very material of their sovereignty. Thus when copyright fails to adequately protect Indigenous cultural creativity from unauthorized appropriations it works particular harms on Indigenous peoples potentially divesting them of their autonomy and selfdetermination. This Section explores the tensions underlying appropriations of Indigenous peoples culture. Part I.A acknowledges important arguments in favor of free access to culture42 arguments often leveraged against efforts to expand copyright protection to better protect Indigenous cultural creativity. Part I.B reviews recent scholarship that situates appropriations of Indigenous culture historically within the broader context of settlercolonialism in the United States.43 These scholars point out that as the federal government was actively dispossessing Indigenous peoples of their lives lands and resources to provide space for growing settler populations settlers actively participated in the pillaging collection and use of all imaginable forms of Indigenous culture.44 Part I.C discusses how copyright law s subject matter has expanded from its origins offering protection against unauthorized appropriations to increasingly diverse forms of cultural creativity. And yet copyright law ultimately has excluded many forms of Indigenous culture relegating them to the public domain and thereby further divesting tribes of their autonomy and selfdetermination.45  Importantly not all forms of Indigenous culture are excluded from copyright protection. I conclude this Section with three contemporary case studies of appropriations of copyrightable Indigenous culture that tease out the complex intersections of copyright policy and settlercolonialism. These examples are by no means exhaustive of the kinds of copyrightable works Indigenous peoples create nor does it fully encompass the problems cultural appropriation presents for Indigenous creators. But as each case study turns at least to some degree on our normative views of what kinds of culture should or should not be available for appropriation they provide a valuable entry point for discussing copyright s fair use doctrine in Parts II and III. The appropriation of culture is a fundamental aspect of human behavior. We all appropriate the culture that surrounds us whether at home at school in our neighborhood at social events or in the workplace to function as individuals within society.46 As Rosemary Coombe has argued cultural categories provide the very possibilities for perception. 47 We draw on culture throughout our lives to contextualize our own experiences and communicate them to others. The ability to acquire possess or control culture is necessary for our personal and collective development and the establishment of our identities.48 Given that culture covers a large swath of each person s existence it may be unsurprising that cultural appropriation has become somewhat normalized into the domain of intellectual property particularly in copyright law.49 Having unrestricted access to culture then may seem an ideal public policy goal and one that our intellectual property laws should favor.50 Lawrence Lessig has argued that historically the public s ability to appropriate local culture has never been regulated by government51 at least not in European and predominantly Europeansettler societies. Government regulation so the argument goes has rarely encroached on even ordinary or noncommercial appropriations of massmediated commercial culture. For example quoting an article making a copy of a TV program for later viewing and giving a copy of a book you own to a friend all seem to be exempt from government control.52  And there may be good reason for this. As Professor Coombe explains in a society where everyday culture is primarily encountered in commodity form being able to appropriate or reference texts that make up our cultural milieu YouTube videos memes tweets etc. enables us to develop a shared reality with others to generate an individual identity or to transform the social narratives these cultural texts come to represent.53 In a world of extraordinarily diverse creativity that can be easily and broadly shared via digital means limitations on the freedom to appropriate culture are often seen as censorship and potentially the loss of an extraordinary amount of creativity which will either never be exercised or never be exercised in the open. 54 While some amount of cultural appropriation is necessary for individuals to develop within their particular social contexts the unauthorized taking of Indigenous culture involves something more particularly within the context of settlercolonialism.55 As I explain in this Section the processes by which the United States and its European predecessors took control of the lands and resources of Indigenous peoples drew upon the mass appropriation of tangible and intangible Indigenous culture. This was both to inform strategies and policies of conquest and to generate legitimizing narratives about the new settlerstate.56 Paradoxically while Indigenous culture became the target of destructive and assimilative federal policies57 American settlers took up Indigenous culture as a freely available resource from which the new American nation could draw for its identity.58 The historical record is replete with examples of unauthorized appropriations from Indigenous cultures by the American public that occurred concurrently with federal policies of conquest removal assimilation and contained selfdetermination multiculturalism.59 Professors Angela Riley and Kristen Carpenter have coined the term Indian appropriation to denote categorically the way the U.S. legal system has facilitated and normalized the taking of all things Indian for others use from lands to sacred objects and from bodies to identities. 60 Indeed the history of federal Indian policy taken as a whole reveals a process of consuming or repurposing nearly every aspect of Indigenous existence the killing of Indigenous peoples and the mutilation of their bodies for bounties or scientific research the acquisition of Tribal lands and natural resources for foreign settlement often without consent or just compensation the inhabitation of Indigenous identities physical appearances and vestments to stimulate settler political or social movements the taking of ritual objects as national antiquities the forced removal of children to boarding schools for intellectual physical religious andor sexual exploitation the commodification of Indigenous expressions histories and knowledges into settler intellectual artistic or other kinds of private property and more recently the reappropriation of the vehicles used to inflict social harms on Indigenous peoples stereotypes racial slurs narratives of conquest for political or economic gain.61 While some might view the unauthorized incorporation of Indigenous culture into mainstream American life as a step forward making American society more diverse open or inclusive cultural appropriation from Indigenous peoples without their free prior and informed consent can only be described as a continuation of the dispossessive work of settlercolonialism.62 In addition to furthering the dispossession of Indigenous lands and resources unauthorized appropriations of Indigenous cultures have had a tendency to compound psychological social and political harms already experienced by Indigenous peoples. Failure to combat unauthorized appropriations risks perpetually inflicting these harms on current and future generations. As Professors Riley and Carpenter explain cultural appropriation has longterm effects on Indigenous peoples individually and collectively Indian appropriation . . . has deep and longlasting impacts with injuries ranging from humiliation and embarrassment to violence and discrimination. Collectively it makes it difficult for tribes to foster religions economies and governance systems that reflect tribal values. All of these experiences diminish both tribal sovereignty and impede the now prevailing federal policy of advancing American Indian selfdetermination in socioeconomic political and cultural life.63 Put differently cultural appropriation has the potential to destroy Indigenous peoples political and territorial sovereignty. The ability to perform unique artistic religious or social practices is often what makes Indigenous communities culturally distinct. Cultural difference has in turn historically justified the recognition of Indigenous groups as independent sovereigns.64 Still while ownership of and control over a specialized expressive culture is clearly important to many Indigenous peoples today both for cultural continuity and differentiation as independent political groups65 protecting Indigenous culture from unauthorized appropriation or misuse can be justified through more than just differencebased identity politics.66 As Rebecca Tsosie and Wallace Coffey have argued Indigenous culture may itself be generative of sovereignty.67 Indigenous peoples often draw from existing social structures and orders relationships between members of a community and understandings of shared belief systems rather than deferring solely to documents as a source of sovereign power.68 Ceremonies continually reproduce and replenish social relationships and establish authorities traditional and nontraditional modes of performance become spaces for political discourse recitations of oral histories in all their many forms lay out precedents adjudicative principles and community norms. Creativity and expressive modes of safeguarding memory often generate authority within Indigenous communities as they help produce and maintain the material that fuels Indigenous peoples autonomy and selfdetermination.69 To the extent that the kinds of Indigenous creative works just mentioned fall under the umbrella of culture Indigenous sovereignty is as Professors Tsosie and Coffey explain perhaps best characterized as a cultural sovereignty. 70 Thus telling Indigenous peoples stories for them singing their songs and publishing their oral histories without permission diminishes Indigenous sovereignty just as the dispossession of Indigenous lands and assimilation of Indigenous peoples into the settlerstate diminished that sovereignty.71 When all Indigenous peoples have left is their culture when political autonomy has been destroyed rights to land and resources diminished or taken outright the right to practice Indigenous religions all but extinguished the last place where Indigenous peoples can be sovereign and experience the real nature of their culture is through modes of expression. Those modes embrace shared symbols stories songs performed social norms and ways of relating with one another.72 Unless Indigenous peoples are able to control the production of their cultures the possibility for continuing Indigenous sovereignty appears bleak. Counterfeits parodies state and corporate narratives anthropological accounts National Geographic photo essays natural history museum exhibits and History Channel documentaries begin to define what Indigenous sovereignty is or can be. Appropriators transform the material of sovereignty into aesthetic or historical objects or styles 73 products to be owned rather than aspects of autonomous modes of existence. American settlercolonization historically deprived Indigenous peoples of their lives lands and resources and then unilaterally transformed them into United States citizens.74 However the conversion of the substance of Indigenous sovereignty into various types of settler property each with their own peculiar limitations is a form of conquest that seems remarkably out of place in the twentyfirst century.75 Copyright exists to promote cultural production76 regardless of the social group that creates it. As American society has grown and evolved over time copyright has historically crept in to regulate the production and circulation of culture by granting exclusive rights to creators for the original works they produce.77  Consider the way the subject matter of copyright has expanded in step with changes in the ways Americans have defined culture. As professor Raymond Williams points out in his history of the term culture at the time of the founding meant a general process of inner intellectual spiritual and aesthetic development one that had become nearly synonymous with term civilization i.e. being cultured .78 But with the rise of the industrial revolution and public dissatisfaction with the changes it wrought on society culture acquired a second definition signifying a set of higher standards or intangible ideals often embodied in art music and literature that pointed out civilization s weaknesses.79 In parallel the original Copyright Act of 1790 passed by the first Congress was narrow in its scope and protected only books maps and charts80 objects reflective of the new country s cultural priorities such as intellectual cultivation political discourse and Enlightenment science.81 But over the course of the nineteenth century Congress added to the Act the arts of designing engraving and etching in 180282 followed by musical compositions in 183183 and plays and other dramatic works in 1856.84 These expansions no doubt reflected the public s new priorities as American culture developed in response to growing industrialization.85 Toward the turn of the twentieth century growing resistance to a universal European descended high culture ultimately produced a third definition of culture the way of life . . . of a people. 86 Scholars in the emerging social sciences began to focus on comparing and taxonomizing cultures in other parts of the world at times defining some as primitive or ancient and others as modern.87 With the diversity of cultural creativity happening in the United States by the beginning of twentieth century American copyright law likewise evolved to cultivate much more than Europeandescended forms of high culture. 88 In Bleistein v. Donaldson Lithographing Company the Court considered whether a set of circus posters could be considered copyrightable. Writing for the majority Justice Holmes opined that works of little merit or of humble degree and those addressed to the less educated classes at least from the point of view of elite judges were eligible for protection under the copyright law.89 He rejected the notion that copyright protects only the cultural creativity of certain social groups  If the posters command the interest of any public they have a commercial value it would be bold to say that they have not an aesthetic and educational value and the taste of any public is not to be treated with contempt. It is an ultimate fact for the moment whatever may be our hopes for a change.90 According to Justice Holmes advertisements such as those depicting the creative work of Barnum and Bailey should be protected under the same rationale as the fine art of Goya Manet or Degas.91 Effectively copyright provided a means for any public to develop and protect its creative interests regardless of whether its tastes or forms of expression conflicted with the hopes of the higher classes for society s overall civilization. Thus by the turn of the twentieth century the scope of copyright had grown to include the creative products of any cultural group as long as those products met the minimum constitutional requirement of being a writing of an author. 92 But while Justice Holmes s broadly inclusive view of the nature of copyrightable works rejected any explicit distinction between various forms of culture over the twentieth century Congress and the courts have perpetuated and developed limitations on the subject matter of copyright. These limitations have left Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups cultural creativity significantly underprotected in comparison to other forms of culture.93  Commentators have generally located the source of the Copyright Act s unequal treatment of Indigenous creative works in the three requirements for copyrightability that Congress and the courts have inferred from the Constitution.94 First copyright requires that all works be written or otherwise fixed in any tangible medium of expression to qualify for protection against unauthorized appropriation.95 As many Indigenous creative works historically have not been written or recorded in physical objects but instead have been retained in collective memory such as songs oral histories stories and dances the fixation requirement may render these works ineligible for copyright protection.96 Second copyright s authorship requirement requires that all works be original 97 meaning a work owes its origin to one or more authors98 and is sufficiently creative to qualify as a work of authorship. 99 Thus a ceremonial song or ritual object that has been faithfully performed or exactly replicated since time immemorial likely does not qualify for copyright protection nor will one that does not have human origins.100 Finally copyright protection does not extend to any idea procedure process system method of operation concept principle or discovery regardless of the form it takes it protects only expression. 101 Often Indigenous peoples value cultural products precisely for the histories processes or principles they contain. When they attempt to protect those aspects of creative works from unauthorized appropriation they unfortunately find that copyright law explicitly makes these aspects of a creative work freely available to the public. Thus owing to these three threshold requirements many forms of Indigenous culture may be considered at least from the perspective of U.S. copyright law to be in the public domain and can be readily appropriated without permission.102 But even with the burden these requirements place on Indigenous creators a large amount of Indigenous cultural material is currently eligible for copyright protection. Indeed in the following subpart I explore three examples of copyrightable Indigenous creativity. And yet while these works likely qualify for copyright protection the fair use doctrine and other limitations on a copyright holder s rights as currently interpreted may allow for their unauthorized appropriation. To evaluate how copyright law operates in instances of cultural appropriation I explore three paradigmatic examples of Indigenous cultural works that are currently being used without permission. These case studies provide concrete examples of Indigenous cultural expressions that likely qualify for copyright protection. But they also show how easily nonIndigenous appropriators can disregard that protection.  Further these cases point out just how difficult it is to generalize about the harms cultural appropriations cause. Often the harms stemming from cultural appropriations depend on the nature of the culture in question including the relationships and creative networks that support develop and produce it. As Bethany Yellowtail a prominent Indigenous fashion designer recently explained It s so complicated trying to explain cultural appropriation because people are like oh it doesn t matter get over it. But I m not going to get over it this affects my family. 103 Given this complexity I argue in Part III that analyses of copyright infringements involving cultural appropriations should include a more contextualized look into the nature of the culture in question and the impacts on the kinds of relations and environments that generate it and are affected by it.  The borrowing of Indigenous ceremonial culture for seemingly educational purposes is a perpetually common mode of cultural appropriation from Indigenous communities. For example The Boy Scouts of America operates a number of youth programs including the Venturing program for fourteen to twentyyearolds which engage youth organized into local Venture Crews in longterm team projects through which they develop life skills and personal ethics. Remarkably a number of nonIndigenous Venture Crews focus on performing powwow a form of Native American ceremonial and social dance as their site of selfdevelopment.104 Crews craft regalia learn dance steps and perform at public powwows.105 Over the course of anthropological fieldwork exploring Boy Scout appropriations106 I learned that unauthorized uses of powwow culture are widespread and take a variety of forms.107 At one lodge I visited nearly every Tuesday night Venture Crew participants would sit at long wooden tables covered with sewing machines hot clothing irons white black red and yellow feathers and ribbons and images they had copied from the Internet.108 Each Crew member worked for several hours at a time carefully creating their regalia for the next powwow. In preparation for their handiwork and performances the Crew members I met dedicated their time to researching the history of American colonization and its devastating effects on Native American communities. But they also spent considerable time researching and copying the themes designs and artworks of Indigenous and nonIndigenous creators they found in articles on websites and through various image searches many of which they then incorporated into their own powwow regalia. Crew members were keenly aware that some in the Indigenous communities in which they performed found their appropriations of Indigenous culture including appropriations of at least some copyrightable pictorial or graphic works deeply offensive. Beadwork ornaments and other conceptually separable designs affixed to or embedded in powwow regalia are often newly created original and fixed in the regalia by the dancer that wears them likely qualifying them for copyright protection.109 These works typically carry significant personal meaning for the dancer not to mention they provide an important space for creativity within this vibrant cultural form. Nonetheless many of the scouts and their leaders I spoke with pointed to powwow s history of inclusion communitybuilding and sharing and their own desires to respectfully support their local Indigenous community as justifications for their assumption of powwow culture. Over the course of my fieldwork I also had the opportunity to speak with members of the Native American communities alongside whom the Boy Scouts danced. These communities took a variety of positions on the Boy Scouts appropriations of powwow culture. Some vehemently opposed it while others welcomed the Scouts openly.110 Most erred on the side of hesitant inclusion while acknowledging that these Scouts held the kind of privilege that made it possible for nonIndigenous suburban teenagers to play Indian 111 at regional powwows including those hosted by the federally funded National Museum of the American Indian.112 Boy Scout appropriations of Native American powwow culture then may involve the unauthorized use of copyrightable materials owned by Indigenous artists and their fellow powwow participants. While these uses are offensive to some in the Native American community and less concerning to others whether they give rise to a legally enforceable copyright infringement claim will likely depend on whether these Boy Scout appropriations fall within copyright s fair use exception. The unauthorized reproduction and distribution of Indigenous culture as an exotic commodity is a second paradigmatic form of cultural appropriation.113 For example Laura Boulton the selfproclaimed music hunter 114 collected a vast number of ceremonial songs from Indigenous peoples around the world from the 1920s until the late1960s.115 In 1929 she traveled to Africa together with her soontobe exhusband an ornithologist to record Indigenous songs that she would later play for paying audiences as she traveled the public lecture circuit in the United States.116 In 1933 she then traveled to Chicago to record Indigenous peoples hired to inhabit a troubling exhibit entitled The Indian Villages at the A Century of Progress exposition. This was a world s fair of sorts displaying the most advanced American technological innovations of the day purposefully juxtaposed against exhibits of traditionally dressed living citizens of Native American Tribes.117 Seven years later she traveled to the Southwestern United States to collect additional Indigenous songs from several Tribes118 and then proceeded to record Indigenous peoples in Central America Canada Alaska and several locations in Asia.119 Altogether she collected roughly 30000 song recordings.120 Over her career Boulton assembled numerous albums of these Indigenous song performances which she then licensed to two commercial labels Victor Records and Folkways Recordings.121 These labels sold thousands of copies of Boulton s albums to the public through 1986 after which the Smithsonian Institution purchased Folkways records and continued to produce its catalog.122 Boulton sold the rights to her remaining recordings to Columbia University as part of a 400000 deal between the University and a wealthy octogenarian suitor.123 Boulton s recordings remain the primary research collection for Columbia s Center for Ethnomusicology124 while SmithsonianFolkways continues to sell or license Boulton s albums of Indigenous songs through physical sales digital downloads and streaming.125 Historical evidence in Boulton s papers suggests that she was an astute negotiator and understood copyright law at far more than a cursory level.126 Yet she together with her labels apparently managed to create tens of thousands of copies of Indigenous music without ever obtaining a copyright assignment or license from her Indigenous informants.127 Such a transfer explicit or implied would have been necessary under the commonlaw rule of the day for her to reproduce and publish the recordings unilaterally. That is because sound recording copyrights at least for the recordings made in the United States generally vested in performers rather than recordists.128 Boulton likely knew that at least some of the recordings she made were of original compositions and that the sound recordings of her Indigenous informants musical performances were copyrightable.129 She also likely knew that some of her recordings were subject to special Tribal protocols or local laws governing their circulation and performance and in at least one documented instance she agreed to uphold those protocols.130 Boulton s unauthorized use of her Indigenous informants copyrightable musical works and sound recordings and the Smithsonian s continued sale of these recordings demonstrates either a doubtful ignorance or a complete disregard for the intellectual property rights and local protocols of these Indigenous peoples. But whether it amounts to copyright infringement likely depends on whether her use of the recordings falls within the contours of copyright s fair use doctrine. Finally consider a contrasting contemporary example of Indigenous artists who are actively reappropriating their ancestors cultural works sometimes against the copyright interests of nonIndigenous individuals and institutions who own them. One of the most prominent examples of this Indigenous renaissance is First Nations artist Jeremy Dutcher131 who recently won the prestigious Polaris Prize for best Canadian music album of the year based on artistic merit.132 The album titled Wolastoqiyik Lintuwakonawa showcases Dutcher singing his original compositions that reinterpret and reincorporate traditional Wolastoqiyik Maliseet songs recorded by William Mechling an anthropologist who visited the Wolastok First Nations in the early 1900s. Dutcher who is Wolastoqiyik from the Tobique First Nation in presentday New Brunswick traveled to the Canadian Museum of History in Gatineau Quebec after being directed by an elder in his community to learn more about his community s songs held in the Museum s archives.133 Dutcher s reanimation of the Mechling recordings is a striking manifestation of contemporary Maliseet culture. Dutcher an operatic tenor and classical composer by training spent nearly five years transcribing and internalizing the recordings in preparation for the album a creative process he refers to as deep listening. 134 Meanwhile Dutcher consulted with his Tobique First Nation community about the meaning of the songs the language used and his intended uses of the song recordings.135 Dutcher s use of the recordings included copying and deriving new works from the musical material contained in them and directly sampling excerpts from the recordings in his album and live performances. The resulting work is impressive. Dutcher elongates and develops the sweeping melodies contained in the recordings layering in powerful chord progressions that help generate new tension and drama. The looped samples from the Mechling recordings help to create a sung dialog between Dutcher and his ancestors as they sing in canonic counterpoint in the Wolastoqiyik language.136 The piece demonstrates in an emotional and powerful way cultural continuity across the intervening decades in which the Canadian government suppressed and criminalized performances of Indigenous culture.137 I draw on Dutcher s work because it represents an increasingly common and important mode of Indigenous cultural creativity happening across North America and around the globe. This mode of creativity involves the reappropriation and creative development of previously captured Indigenous culture in deliberate and decolonizing ways.138 These appropriations often explicitly copy and derive new works from documentary works owned by nonIndigenous collectors or the institutions for whom they worked and thus may constitute copyright infringement unless copyright law provides a viable exception.139 While cultural appropriations may be necessary for normal human development and the progress of creativity generally unauthorized appropriations of Indigenous culture carry the prospect of causing significant harm through further dispossession of critical aspects of Indigenous lives. While some Indigenous works do not qualify for copyright protection many do such as those at issue in the case studies just discussed. In some cases copyrighted Indigenous works are owned by Indigenous peoples themselves who seek to defend them from unauthorized use by nonIndigenous appropriators. In others nonIndigenous individuals or institutions hold the copyrights with Indigenous artists and traditional practitioners seeking to use them without permission. As these and other Indigenous works are appropriated questions remain as to whether copyright law can effectively balance the public benefits of those appropriations against the interests of the copyright owners. Given that many Indigenous works are copyrightable Indigenous peoples should be able to rely on copyright infringement claims as a means of defending their creative works against cultural appropriations. Importantly however not all unauthorized uses of a copyrighted work constitute infringement. Copyright is a porous form of protection allowing unauthorized uses of a creative work under certain exceptions.140 Foremost among these is copyright law s fair use doctrine.141 Now codified in 17 U.S.C. 107 the fair use doctrine is a flexible equitable rule of reason that permits the unauthorized use of a copyrightable work when four factors applied variably depending on context lead a court to believe that the public interest in the specific use outweighs the copyright holder s interest.142 In practice fair use prevents culture from being completely locked up for followon creators.143 But in doing so it also weakens cultural creators ability to control uses of their expressions by others allowing others to exploit the culture they create for certain publicly beneficial purposes. In its role of balancing the public s interest in creative progress against the rights of copyright holders fair use acts as a gatekeeping mechanism for cultural appropriations. Whether copyrightable Indigenous creativity can be protected against appropriation may turn on how a court balances the statutory fair use factors.  This Section provides an overview and history of the fair use factor test focusing specifically on a critical part of the test for cases involving cultural appropriation. Part II.A gives a brief overview of the four statutory factors.144 It shows why the second fairuse factor the nature of the copyrighted work is of particular importance to Indigenous creators seeking to defend their cultural works from appropriation. As the second factor has rarely played a significant role in copyright cases since its codification in 1976 Part II.B reviews the commonlaw development of the second factor to recover its underlying purposes its early role helping judges understand the nature and value of a work and the reasons behind its seeming demise. Part II.C discusses the codification of the second factor and its apparent import to Congress at the time. Part II.D explains how the factor s scope narrowed through subsequent interpretations by the Supreme Court. Part II.E then shows why the current second factor test fails to adequately assess the nature of certain forms of cultural creativity. This Part sets the stage for the factor s proposed rehabilitation in Part III. A copyright holder generally has the right to prevent others from reproducing making derivative works from distributing publicly performing or displaying or if the work is a sound recording digitally transmitting a work she owns.145 But the right is limited. Fair use is among the devices courts and Congress have developed to temper a copyright owner s rights. It allows members of the public to use copyrighted material without the owner s permission when the benefits of the use to the public outweigh the private benefits to the copyright holder. Ad hoc fair use assessments are part of everyday life in many fields activities like news reporting criticism academic research classroom teaching and similar uses would be difficult or impossible without the doctrine of fair use. But finding a balance between the public s interest in access to culture and the private rights of authors who produce it has been elusive. Not long after the first Copyright Act became law in 1790 American courts borrowed and further developed the common law doctrine we know today as fair use.146 In 1976 Congress codified its understanding of the fair use doctrine in a fact seeking fourfactor test.147 The test is not a checklist but a balancing test with each of the factors weighed together to determine whether an unauthorized appropriation of a copyrighted work is an infringement of the copyright owner s rights or a use permitted by law. Courts typically focus most of their analysis on the first fourth and third factors respectively.148 The first of the four fair use factors the purpose and character of the use seems to be the most influential as it assesses how compelling an unauthorized use may be.149 It raises questions such as whether the use of the work is transformative in a way that advances the goals of copyright law150 whether the sole purpose for the use is commercial exploitation without a public benefit151 and whether the use of the work serves nonprofit educational purposes.152 The fourth factor the effect of the use upon the potential market or value of the copyrighted work is also highly influential.153 It addresses the potential changes in economic value an unauthorized use would impose on the current copyright owner154 and whether the use will preempt future authorized uses of the work155 and compares these to the public benefits of the use of the work.156 The third factor the amount and substantiality of the portion used without permission in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole may also play a significant role particularly when the copied proportion of the work seems excessive in comparison to any publicly beneficial use being claimed157 or when the unauthorized use captures the heart of the original work.158 Finally courts give surprisingly little attention that is typically only a few sentences to the second factor or the nature of the copyrighted work. 159 This is remarkable considering that analysis of the nature of the work being appropriated seems to have played a vital role from the earliest American fair use cases through fair use s codification in 1976.160 For many Indigenous cultural works such as the ones discussed in Part I their nature should play a significant role in determining whether or not their unauthorized appropriation can be justified. For example the unauthorized use of an Indigenous song might be treated differently if it is sacred or ceremonial like a Din blessingway song than if it is a popular Navajo country song meant to circulate in the local or global entertainment economy.161 While lower courts have struggled to find a meaningful use for this factor in recent years understanding its historical development and the variety of purposes it has served may prove insightful for those seeking to understand when unauthorized uses of Indigenous culture or Indigenous reappropriations of their culture owned by others is fair. 162  The Supreme Court locates the origins of the contemporary fair use doctrine in the midnineteenth century case Folsom v. Marsh which distilled the essence of law and methodology of prior English common law rules to the fourpart fair use framework we have today.163 Admittedly few cases prior to the codification of the fair use factor test in 1976 cited Folsom as supplying the scope and methodology for the fair use analysis.164 Indeed some commentators have gone so far as to reject Folsom as creating fair use in American copyright law arguing instead that it represents a redefinition of copyright infringement itself.165 Still this subpart takes the Supreme Court at its word and performs a close reading of Folsom to flesh out what the essence of the second fair use factor might be. Then it proceeds to track the factor s commonlaw development through its codification in the 1976 Copyright Revision Act. Finally this subpart gives an overview of the ways the second fair use factor has been interpreted in more recent cases through its recent demise in some federal circuit courts of appeal. The Copyright Act s second fair use factor traces its roots to the American common law doctrine whose factors were first articulated by Justice Story in his 1841 opinion in Folsom v. Marsh.166 The Folsom litigation came about when Jared Sparks and Charles Folsom publishers of a twelvevolume set of George Washington s papers167 brought a copyright infringement action168 against Rev. Charles W. Upham and his publisher for allegedly duplicating a few hundred pages from the set in their much shorter twovolume biography of Washington made for school libraries.169 A fair use defense was never raised in the litigation.170 However the court in Folsom established what the Supreme Court later referred to as the doctrine of fair use an exception to a copyright holder s exclusive rights justified by copyright law s overriding purpose of supporting cultural and intellectual development.171 A core challenge Justice Story faced in this case was deciding how to assess the nature of George Washington s letters memos and other documents and then determining whether their nature made them more or less susceptible to Upham s educational but unauthorized use. Given the peculiar nature and character of the issues presented in the case Justice Story famously penned  it is not . . . easy to arrive at any satisfactory conclusion or to lay down any general principles applicable to all cases. Patents and copyrights approach nearer than any other class of cases . . . to what may be called the metaphysics of the law. . . .172 Though clearly laced with humor Justice Story s preoccupations over the ontological complexities at the core of copyright law certainly linger today as courts seek to understand the proper scope of the fair use analysis. Justice Story explained that the test for whether an unauthorized but educational use infringes another s copyright turns on the nature and objects of the selections made by the unauthorized user the quantity and value of the materials used and the degree in which the use may prejudice the sale or diminish the profits or supersede the objects of the original work. 173 As he applied this framework to Upham s unauthorized use of Sparks s documents Justice Story articulated each of the four contemporary fair use factors. To start Justice Story suggested that the purpose and character of Upham s copying from Sparks s volume for use in school libraries would be in the absence of the other factors a lawful and justifiable use. 174 But the amount and substantiality of the work copied by Upham in proportion to his work as a whole outweighed that educational purpose. 175 The copied material amounted to more than one third of Upham s work and unabashedly copied the documents of most interest and value to the public. 176 According to Justice Story those key documents incorporated into Upham s secondary work the essential value of the original.177 And having copied the most important parts of Sparks s work the resulting effect on the market for the original work would be that the plaintiff s copyright be totally destroyed. 178 In addition to these considerations Justice Story s analysis of the nature of the copyrighted work or the second fair use factor was also key to the outcome of the case.179 The Folsom opinion instructs that whether an unauthorized appropriation of another s work is justifiable hinges on not only quantity but value being appropriated the nature . . . of the selections made the value of the materials used and the degree in which the use may . . . supersede the objects of the original work. 180  For Justice Story the analysis of the nature of the work involved the relationships George Washington had to the documents he produced and to the publics who would ultimately use and value them. Justice Story suggested that Washington s letters were to some degree an extension of his persona and genius they illustrated the life the acts and the character of Washington and were thus as singular as he was.181 But while they showed his style and his mode of constructing sentences and his habits of composition 182 they perhaps more importantly demonstrated Washington s contributions to American culture and the intellectual networks of which he was a part.183 Thus in assessing the nature and the value of the material copied Justice Story took into account the relationship of the papers to their creator and their value to the creative sphere in which the papers circulated. Importantly the nature of Washington s papers at least for the purpose of evaluating the justness of their unauthorized appropriation had little to do with whether he intended for them to be published or even valued as literary compositions. 184 Washington likely knew at the time he authored each document that he had generated something of expressive and intellectual value for those to whom the documents would circulate. Also he continued to value them even after they had served their original informationconveying function. As the court explained their preservation and bequest by Washington demonstrated their nature as a subject of value to himself and to his posterity. 185 Thus even in the nascent stages of fair use in the United States the nature of a work being copied its mode of production its relationships to existing intellectual and cultural networks and its value to those networks were key sites of inquiry for adjudicating the justness of an unauthorized use against the rights of the copyright holder. At the same time the Folsom Court rejected methods for understanding the nature of a work which fixated on the work s publication potential or level of creativity. Not all would agree with this reading of Folsom and the importance of the nature inquiry to the fair use analysis. Some commentators have taken particular issue with the way Justice Story accounts for the value of a creative work to the author. Professor Patterson for example argues that such a move incorporated into federal copyright law the notion that works could receive protection simply because the author exerted effort to create them and not because a copyright was needed to encourage their dissemination.186 A copyright system premised on granting property rights to reward an author s labor was not the intention of the drafters of the Intellectual Property Clause who were more concerned with maintaining a robust public domain free of censorship.187 But Justice Story s inclusion of the nature of a work and its value to the author and her creative networks need not be read as only according undue private property interests to authors on account of their labor. Rather exploring the nature of a work in the manner articulated by Justice Story in the fair use analysis may usefully show how a given unauthorized appropriation impedes creative progress.188 It might highlight for example the way unauthorized appropriation stifles the incentives to create and disseminate cultural expression. Or it may reveal how an appropriation violates protocols and norms necessary for creative production in some communities. As I explore in Part III these concerns are particularly salient to Indigenous peoples and their cultural creativity and they must be accounted for in the fair use analysis if copyright law is to promote the progress of science and the useful arts in all their diversity of forms and natures.  However legitimate Justice Story s underlying theory may have been from our contemporary vantage point it is clear that the second fair use factor as originally articulated in Folsom included an analysis of how authors and the networks within which they operate understand and value the work they create.  It took well over a century after Folsom for Congress to codify the doctrine of fair use as we know it today. Still as Professor Reese points out fair use was regularly relied on in copyright disputes in the intervening years.189 During those years the fair use doctrine entered a period of somewhat erratic development.190 In fact in 1961 a Senate subcommittee study identified roughly eight factors that courts had been using to conduct fair use analyses any of which could be determinative.191 Thus it is quite remarkable that less than a decade later the House Senate and the Federal Court of Claims citing that same study were able to reduce the fair use doctrine to the four factors initially introduced by Justice Story.192 Courts approaches to the nature of the copyrighted work factor in the fair use analysis during this time often intersected with other fair use factors. Courts used language like the effect on the original work the nature of the works involved or the relative value of the appropriated work in relation to the original work to describe their methodology.193 In some cases courts would use this factor to compare the function of the original work to the copy to assess the level of actual or potential harm posed by an appropriation such as whether making unauthorized copies effectively substituted for or competed with the original work or actually reduced demand for it.194 An important line of cases that emerged in the early twentieth century relied on the nature inquiry as a potentially deciding factor. Courts of this era considered some works to be more susceptible to fair uses than others due to the purpose behind their creation their methods of construction or the value and importance of the work for future developments within certain creative and intellectual networks. Publications of the arts and sciences for example works circulated not only for their own pecuniary profit but for the advancement of science were just the sort of works for which fair use existed.195 One variant on this logic looked to the nature of the copyrighted materials to determine whether their distribution would serve the public interest in the free dissemination of information and whether their preparation requires some use of prior materials dealing with the same subject matter. 196 These courts examined how the particular appropriation at issue would either hamper or further the kinds of relations and modes of intellectual production that existed within a particular creative field. For example in a case involving the unauthorized appropriation of biographical writing on Howard Hughes the court looked at what was reasonable and customary among biographers to determine the appropriation s fairness noting that it was common for biographers to refer to and utilize earlier works dealing with the subject of the work and occasionally to quote directly from such works. 197 Other courts relied on the nature of the work to suggest that if an appropriation actually furthered the goals of the original work s authors it would tend to favor fair use.198 Despite its marginalized status in fair use cases today the nature of a copyrighted work played a significant role in the fair use analysis at common law. Courts looked to this factor to reveal formal differences between an original work and unauthorized copies to discuss the necessity of freely disseminating the work to serve public purposes and as a support for the other fair use factors. But its evolution certainly did not diminish its importance. Indeed these cases show that inquiring into the aesthetic form of a creative work and its function and intellectual value within its creative networks remained integral to the nature inquiry. There is relatively little written about why Congress ultimately included the nature of the copyrighted work in the fair use provision of the 1976 Copyright Revision Act. And yet the available House and Senate subcommittee reports suggest that Congress found this factor to be integral to the fair use doctrine at the time of the Copyright Revision Act s passage. As I discuss below these subcommittee reports reveal that Congress intended to maintain the fair use framework as it existed at common law while considering technological issues pertinent to the era. Codifying the fair use doctrine involved decades of complex negotiation. A major overhaul of the copyright law passed in 1909 but Congress could not garner sufficient agreement on the scope of a fair use provision to include one into statutory law.199 From the 1920s to the 1940s numerous fair use amendment bills were introduced but were never passed.200 Ultimately the Supreme Court s 44 split over the fairness of the National Institutes of Health s unauthorized photocopying of medical journal articles appears to have increased the urgency of codifying the fair use doctrine.201  For roughly a decade the House and Senate subcommittees debated what factors if any should be included in the new fair use provision. In early versions of the 1976 Copyright Revision Act the House of Representatives inserted a much more abbreviated fair use provision containing one straightforward line the fair use of a copyrighted work is not an infringement of copyright. 202 But after receiving significant criticism for its barebones approach Congress instead sought to codify specific factors that could provide both courts and the public a rubric for making everyday decisions about the use of copyrighted works.203 Instead of developing its own fair use factors based on its contemporary policy priorities the congressional subcommittees who drafted the provision made clear in their reports that the 1976 Act restated the judicially created principle of fair use while not changing freezing narrowing nor enlarging it in any way.204 Thus Congress likely presumed that the common law fair use doctrine s focus on assessing the mode of creation of a work its function within its creative networks and its creative or intellectual value to those networks previously undertaken by courts would continue on under the new statute. While asserting that the new fair use provision was merely a restatement of the common law fair use doctrine the House and Senate subcommittees that drafted the second fair use factor also provided some limited commentary on ways it might be used. The subcommittees explained that the second factor could shed light on both 1 the character of the work being copied and 2 its availability to the public.205 It is important to note however that these comments were made in response to very narrow debates about fair use in the classroom and were unlikely to have been intended as a limitation on what the nature factor could embody.206 To elucidate what they meant by the character of a work the subcommittees used an example of a teacher making copies of two different kinds of work for their classroom A news article from the daily press would be judged differently under the second factor from a full orchestral score of a musical composition. 207 To explain this distinction the subcommittees posited that by their nature musical compositions dramas and movies are intended for performance or public exhibition while newspaper articles contain material that is of current interest to supplement and update the students textbooks. 208 While concrete the distinction the subcommittees attempted to draw regarding the nature of these two kinds of works did little to clarify what method or standard if any courts were to use for the second factor.209 In addition to the orchestral score vs. newspaper article distinction the subcommittees provided two other distinctions relevant to assessing the nature of the copyrighted work. One distinction looked at the extent to which a copy takes the same form as the original mirroring the existing common law.210 Another looked at whether an original work is out of print as this may justify fair use in some cases unless the author intentionally chose not to publish the work.211 This distinction has since been subsumed under the fourth factor.212 Neither of these distinctions shed any additional light on what should be encompassed by the second fair use factor. Thus perhaps the primary takeaway from a contemporary reading of the legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Revision Act is that as Robert Kasunic has pointed out Congress left significant room in its construction and interpretation of the second fair use factor for a host of potential inquiries.213 Notwithstanding the potential Congress left for a broad range of inquiries under the second fair use factor federal courts have used its analytical power sparingly. This may owe in large part to the way it was first articulated in Harper Row v. Nation Enterprises. The Supreme Court in that case recognized two basic distinctions on which the nature of a work might rest 1 whether the work is published or unpublished and 2 whether a work is creative fictional or factual.214 As I explain below these distinctions have been significantly narrowed by Congress and lower courts effectively hollowing out the second factor. In Harper Row the Court considered whether the news magazine The Nation fairly used Gerald Ford s then unpublished memoir A Time to Heal when it reproduced portions having to do with Ford s pardon of Richard Nixon in a scoop of the book.215 The courts below had taken distinct approaches in applying the second factor. The Southern District of New York analyzed the nature of Ford s memoir by looking only to its publication status noting that the manuscript was soontobepublished and therefore was generally protected against unauthorized prepublication uses.216 On review the Second Circuit rejected that approach and instead looked to the proportion of factual content contained in the work.217 Examining the content of Ford s memoir the Second Circuit majority noted that because facts are not copyrightable factladen historical works like memoirs are generally accorded thinner copyright protection.218 Ford s memoir was thus more susceptible to fair use.219 The Supreme Court seemingly found both the District Court and Second Circuit s inquiries worthwhile under the second factor and proceeded to provide further guidance on both.220 First the Court explained that the unpublished status of a work was a critical element of its nature 221 and that an author s interests in confidentiality and creative control prior to publication would generally outweigh other fair use considerations.222 The special treatment of unpublished works in the statutory fair use analysis was necessary because prior to the Copyright Revision Act unpublished works had not been protected automatically by federal copyright law.223 By distinguishing unpublished works from published ones in the fair use analysis the Court hoped to embed values previously embodied by the common law right of first publication such as an author s prepublication interest in deciding whether and in what form to release his work. 224  Following the Court s adoption of the publishedunpublished distinction in Harper Row subsequent lower court opinions placed special emphasis on the unpublished nature of a work for at least a short period of time when such work was appropriated without the copyright owner s permission.225 But this approach produced a number of anomalies such as a biographer becoming subject to a copyright infringement suit for drawing quotes from a major literary figure s papers that had been donated to publicly accessible archive.226 Shortly after the Harper Row decision Congress cast doubt on the publishedunpublished distinction when it passed an amendment to the Copyright Act s fair use provision clarifying that the unpublished status of a work shall not itself bar a finding of fair use. 227 While still material to the second factor analysis publication status would no longer be a deciding factor in fair use cases.228  The Harper Row Court s second distinction whether the copyrighted material is creative or factual in nature has survived much longer. In assessing the nature of the Ford memoir the Supreme Court began by observing that the law generally recognizes a greater need to disseminate factual works than works of fiction or fantasy. 229 Still when analyzing Ford s work the Court resisted relying on categorical characterizations like factual or creative. 230 While it characterized the memoir as an unpublished historical narrative or autobiography the Court s assessment of the book s nature focused on the author s craftsmanship the inseparability of Ford s expressions from the facts his portraits of public figures and the cultural power that craftsmanship conveyed to the audience.231 The Court further refined the factualnature assessment of the second fair use factor in Campbell v. AcuffRose Music. There the Court was asked to determine whether the hiphop group 2 Live Crew s parody of Roy Orbison s song Pretty Woman qualified as a fair use. 232 The Court framed its inquiry into the nature of Pretty Woman as an assessment of how close to the core of copyright the original work might be.233 Without providing guidance on its methodology the Court strung together a list of distinctions it had drawn between different types of works in prior fair use cases fictional works soontobepublished memoirs motion pictures and creative works the Court suggested would require more compelling support from the other fair use factors than factual works published speeches news broadcasts and factual compilations for a claim of fair use by an unauthorized appropriator to be successful. In applying its framework to the case at hand the Court held simply that Pretty Woman was the kind of expressive work copyright was designed to protect but that its expressive nature was ultimately of little consequence in an instance of parody which the Court argued generally requires appropriation from an original expressive work to carry out its special kind of criticism and commentary.234 Thus the second factor analysis adopted by the Court in Campbell at most increases reliance on the other fair use factors but does little to inform courts about what aspects of the nature of a work might foreclose unauthorized uses. Courts have subsequently reduced considerations over the need to disseminate factual works in Harper Row and the protection of works that are at the core of copyright in Campbell to a binary question of whether the appropriated work is creative or factual. 235 In contemporary practice courts have been reluctant to permit unauthorized appropriation when a work is more creative than factual. 236 Still these cases reveal the inherent subjectivity of the factualcreative distinction as courts often must either exert their own creativity to find a work is nonfactual or simply dismiss the utility of the second factor altogether.237 It isn t yet clear why the nowforgotten second factor has failed to develop beyond the publishedunpublished and factualcreative distinctions since its codification. It may be that few instances of copyright infringement have been litigated involving works that by nature should not be susceptible to unauthorized uses. Whatever the case as Indigenous and other marginalized groups begin to assert their rights to cultural creativity the current fair use test will likely be of little benefit to judges who must decide the fairness of complex cultural appropriations. The inadequacy of the second factor has already been seen in the case of sacred religious works that have been used without permission. For example in Religious Technology Center v. Lerma the district court hearing the case struggled to identify the nature of the Church of Scientology s Advanced Technology documents after the Washington Post claimed in an infringement suit that its copying and proposed publication of the documents was a fair use.238 The Southern District of California and the Second Circuit had reached opposite conclusions about the nature of the very same works.239 Ultimately the court looked to the Church s understanding contained in its historical records and found the nature of the documents to be factual supporting the Washington Post s fair use defense.240 Other cases have turned out the opposite way. In Worldwide Church of God v. Philadelphia Church of God one church had appropriated and published a racially intolerant religious book owned by another without the latter s permission the church had attempted to use the work s copyright to keep it out of the public eye. As with Lerma the District Court in Worldwide Church also struggled with the factualcreative distinction. The court reasoned that the book might appear factual by readers who share the author s religious beliefs but ultimately held that the creativity imagination and originality embodied in the book tilt the scale against fair use. 241 As these cases demonstrate sacred or spiritual works are often left in appropriation limbo as judges try to figure out their proximity to copyright s core by attempting to compare them to genres that they believe are inherently factual or creative. 242 The ambivalence of the forgoing opinions raises serious doubts that the current second factor analysis could fairly weigh the specific harms appropriation causes to Indigenous creators against the public interest. For example how would a court classify the expression of a tribe s origination story by a tribal elder? As more creative or more factual? And which way should such a determination weigh particularly if Tribal protocols or community norms heavily restrict who can create such expressions and how they circulate? To better address such ambiguities in the case of sacred works the nature inquiry should do much more. In his Second Circuit opinion in Author s Guild a 2015 case deciding whether Google Books snippets view feature could be considered a fair use of millions of copyrighted books Judge Pierre Leval cast significant doubt on the second fair use factor s continuing relevance holding that the factual nature of a work should not imply that others may freely copy it. 243 Then in a 2018 opinion he went so far as to say that the second factor is only relevant when considering the first fair use factor s transformative use test244 rejecting it as an independent source of analysis. The second fair use factor at least in the Second Circuit245 has been all but written out of the Copyright Act. And yet the forgotten factor has received renewed prominence in the Supreme Court s most recent exposition of the fair use doctrine. In Google LLC v. Oracle Inc. the Court was tasked with determining whether Google s copying of a portion Oracle s Java API code was a fair use.246 The court relied on the second fair use factor to show that the copied code functioned differently than other kinds of computer code within the broader programming environment.247 Because the code in question was not intended to be innovative but instead provided programmers a wellknown package of commands organized in a familiar way the Court found it did not merit the same level of protection from unauthorized appropriation afforded to other kinds of code protected by the Copyright Act.248 Thus the Court fell back on the factualcreative distinction previously established in Campbell to support its holding that Google s unauthorized use of Oracle s code was fair.249 While Justice Story originally framed the inquiry into the nature of a work as one analyzing the value of a work within its creative or intellectual milieu subsequent articulations of the factor including by Congress have left the factor open to numerous interpretations. And yet the Supreme Court has in recent years seemingly limited the factor to two narrow distinctions its publication status and its level of facticity. The result is that the current fair use analysis has little space in its current form to address the unique harms cultural appropriations pose to the creativity of Indigenous and other marginalized communities. If the purpose of American copyright law is to incentivize production of culture as that term has evolved over time how might we rehabilitate fair use in a way that accomplishes this goal without enabling the patterns of settlercolonial cultural appropriation identified in Part I within our copyright jurisprudence? As Part II revealed the portion of the fair use analysis that was supposed to shed light on the impact of appropriation by looking at the particular nature of the work being appropriated has been all but written out of the Copyright Act by some courts or greatly narrowed in others. This is deeply problematic for all creators but particularly for creators of Indigenous cultural works. In this Section I propose a rehabilitation of the second fair use factor reconceptualizing it in a way that gives nature its due meaning. At the outset I acknowledge that there may be other ways to reorient the fair use doctrine to combat cultural appropriations without transforming the second factor. Congress did not limit the fair use analysis to just those factors included in the Copyright Act s section 107.250 Indeed Congress left the possibility of adding additional factors open to courts applying the fair use doctrine251 and commentators have taken this leeway to propose numerous alternative factors.252 A new fair use factor that evaluates an unauthorized use of Indigenous culture in terms of its effects on the community that produced it may certainly make fair use more responsive to the interests of Indigenous groups.  But the underlying problem is not that Indigenous peoples or any other group s cultural products are incommensurable with the underlying concept of fair use and therefore should be relegated to some alternative universe of analysis. Indigenous peoples after all make sculptures hip hop albums poetry building blueprints and feature films works that fit easily within copyright s landscape. Rather the fundamental problem is that fair use currently fails to account for the ontological diversity of culture being produced in the United States today instead privileging Europeandescended cultural forms and their creative environments. Copyright must respond and evolve as it has in the past even if this means disrupting the settled expectations of our established creativeindustrial complexes.  Thus this Section advocates for letting the second factor do the work for which it was historically designed but which it has never fully realized. Part III.A begins by reviewing applicable commentary on the second fair use factor. Part III.B then proposes how the second fair use factor might be rehabilitated to better address the needs of Indigenous peoples. After Part III.C makes some brief notes on how this rehabilitated factor might be implemented Part III.D concludes by applying it to the case studies discussed in Part I.  Scholarly commentary has begun to develop alternative approaches to the second fair use factor. Some advocate for drawing on the second factor to assess the effects of an unauthorized use on creative production.253 Others suggest using the second fair use factor to inquire about the fair user s engagement with Indigenous peoples laws and protocols.254 These approaches inform my proposal for a rehabilitated second factor in the following Section. Roughly twenty years before Judge Leval penned the Second Circuit s Authors Guild opinion his formulation of the second factor seemed full of analytical possibilities some of which have yet to be fully explored. At that time the second factor had been only superficially discussed and little understood and merited much deeper consideration than the brightline rules regarding publication status and facticity courts adopted postHarper Row.255 In an article extensively cited by the Supreme Court in Campbell256 Judge Leval argued that the primary focus of the second factor should be on protecting the incentives of authorship including protecting the reasonable expectations of one who engages in the kinds of creationauthorship that copyright seeks to encourage 257 while also providing space for authors to practice the craft in the privacy of the laboratory without running the risk of premature critique.258 For Judge Leval there were two analytical questions the second fair use factor was supposed to help answer. The first was whether the original work is the type of material that copyright was designed to stimulate and the second whether the unauthorized appropriation of a work would interfere significantly with the original author s entitlements. 259 The type of work was key to his framework as those works considered to be creative endeavors for the public edification should be afforded greater protection from unauthorized uses than those that are at best incidental beneficiaries. 260 Thus works created for publication works of the creative or instructive type that the copyright laws value and seek to foster would be more resistant to unauthorized appropriation while shopping lists and personal calendars for example could be made more vulnerable.261 Still Judge Leval s framework resisted any brightline rules no category of copyrighted material is either immune from use or completely without protection. 262 Though Judge Leval seems to have backed away from a categorical approach to the second fair use factor in his Author s Guild opinion263 his second point of analysis whether a use might interfere with an original author s entitlements may be a point of productive development for the fair use doctrine in cases of cultural appropriation. Building on Judge Leval s approach Robert Kasunic suggests that once we understand the work and the reasonable and customary expectations of authors for that type of material we can better understand how various uses might affect the incentive to create such works. 264 In other words the nature that the second factor is meant to reveal to the fact finder should include the economic drivers for a work including the networks of publishers producers and performers as well as the funding sources and licensing regimes that incentivized its creation and the potential harms an unauthorized use may cause to those drivers.265 Rather than a brightline rule this sort of approach seems to suggest two analytical steps. First a court would examine the creative environment for a work to understand the reasonable and customary expectations under which an author created it.266 Second a court would analyze how the unauthorized use in question would impact the incentives on which participants within that creative environment rely. The second factor would weigh against fair use when actual or potential harms to the work s creative environment were found. However where the creative environments would suffer no harm from unauthorized appropriation perhaps the environments incentivizing doodles during long meetings selfies or text messages such a fact might weigh in favor of fair use.267 Other commentary on the second fair use factor points to the factor s unique capacity for incorporating Indigenous customs norms and protocols into the fair use analysis. Recent debates in Australia over whether to adopt a fair use doctrine to replace its current doctrine of fair dealing have specifically looked at fair use s potential impact on Indigenous peoples.268 In 2013 the Australian Law Reform Commission ALRC recommended to the Attorney General of Australia that a fair use provision with a second factor nearly identical to that found in U.S. copyright law be incorporated into the Australian copyright act.269 Importantly the ALRC s recommendation was tempered with an overarching proviso that stated cultural considerations in particular issues relating to Indigenous culture and cultural practices need always to be considered alongside economic rights. 270 Unlike U.S. copyright law Australian copyright law affords some explicit protection to Indigenous creativity owing in part to the 1998 Bulun Bulun opinion from Australia s high court.271 While the proposed fair use provision has not yet been adopted in Australia commentators Natalie Stoianoff and Evana Wright argue that the Australian fair use doctrine s second factor if adopted as proposed may play a key role in ensuring Indigenous peoples rights and interests relating to copyrightable culture are respected  Any fair use exception needs to take into account the special relationship between Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islander communities and their cultural production . . . . The application of fair use provisions to use of traditional cultural expressions should be subject to the rights and interests of the relevant Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander community.272 Given the ALRC s proviso and Australia s recognition of the copyrightability of some Indigenous cultural expressions Stoianoff and Wright interpret the second fair use factor as potentially requiring appropriators to consult with Indigenous communities before a use of their cultures can be considered fair. 273 Consultation would allow potential fair users and courts ex post to determine what the work is from an Indigenous point of view and then take the necessary precautions to ensure Indigenous interests are protected.274 In effect this interpretation of the second factor would mean fair users likely would have to comply with existing protocols adopted by Indigenous communities prior to making publicly beneficial use of their cultural materials without express permission. While scholarship dedicated to the second fair use factor is sparse commentators recognize the factor s continued importance in assessing its potential impact on creative networks and its potential to account for Indigenous protocols governing the creation and circulation of culture. Given these insights how should courts shape the forgotten factor going forward particularly in cases of cultural appropriation from Indigenous peoples? Based on the commentary just discussed the second factor should at least reveal an unauthorized appropriation s impact on the specific drivers supporting the particular kind of cultural production at issue.275 But it should also be grounded in the actual relationships involved in producing cultural creativity relationships that may be governed by local community protocols and cultural norms. By looking at the reasonable and customary expectations of creators within their particular creative networks a court may be able to assess whether an unauthorized use will disrupt motivation to create similar works.276 But developing a methodology that actually takes stock of how culture is produced and accurately assesses the effects of appropriation on creative production without incorporating cultural bias poses significant challenges. Take for example Kasunic s taxonomic approach to the second factor which suggests that courts afford greater protection to works that fit within the categories listed in section 102 of the Copyright Act than those that do not. Section 102 provides a nonexhaustive list of creative works that presumably fall within the subjectmatter of copyright. However the list contains predominantly Europeandescended cultural forms that Congress has periodically expanded to meet industry demands.277 If we were to apply his proposed framework unless a cultural form conforms to the characteristics of these cultural categories the works produced might be at an elevated risk for unauthorized appropriation. In effect creators of copyrightable Indigenous works e.g. copyrightable songs dances ceremonies or visual works would be compelled either to create their works in such a way that they could be read by a court as being part of a Europeandescended creative tradition industry or class or otherwise face legally sanctioned appropriations going forward. Such a result seemingly would run counter to the broadly inclusive approach to copyright enunciated by Justice Holmes more than a century ago.278 Ascertaining the nature of the copyrighted work for fair use purposes must be more than an exercise in taxonomy. This is because determining the nature of a thing it is not strictly an empirical question or one that can be answered by applying a single standardized metric. Relying on a taxonomy of creative works like whether a work fits within the categories codified in section 102 or whether a work is factual or creative can only give us information about how a work differs from others not specific information about how a creative work is generated. Rather framing the nature question as an ontological one reveals the position of a thing in relation to others in the world allowing the factfinder to examine the work in the context of the creative networks that produce it and depend on it.279  For example a taxonomic approach might make assumptions about the nature of a work based the work s features. It might ask questions like does it seem like a sculpture a painting or a musical score based on one s perception of it?280 But taxonomies always seem to privilege certain distinctions over others. They depend on the priorities and values of those with power to produce their underlying categories and their units of analysis. At bottom taxonomies are maps of socially salient differences or distinctions they actualize the prevailing epistemes in which the taxonomy is created.281 Thus they inescapably derive from a particular cultural point of view and moment in history.282 A taxonomic approach to the second fair use factor based on section 102 would be especially illsuited to meet the needs of the increasingly diverse creative environments copyright is meant to serve.283 Perhaps at the time of the first Copyright Act in 1790 assessing the nature of a creative work by comparing it to Europeandescended cultural categories might have passed muster as a viable focal point for determining whether a work should or should not be widely appropriated.284 But as Folsom and its progeny make clear the core of copyright cannot easily be defined without reference to the networks producing creative works and the intellectual value those networks place on them. 285 Defining the nature of a creative work in terms of set categories that inherently favor Europeansettler culture seem out of step with the trajectory of copyright law since the early twentieth century.286 Indeed Congress codified the second fair use factor in 1976 well after theories of unilinear Europeandescended cultural development had been abandoned and Indigenous cultures and worldviews had been widely recognized as worthy of state recognition.287 If the nature of the copyrighted work analysis is not about how comfortably the work fits into our presentday section 102 categories how do we assess it in a way that helps us know when a work should or should not be available for unauthorized appropriation for a publicly beneficial purpose? Building on Judge Leval s and Robert Kasunic s proposals for assessing the creative environment for a work I argue that the second fair use factor should examine An ontological approach to assessing the nature of a thing would avoid categorical declarations to justify or reject a fair use claim and instead examine the relations surrounding the original work in question. First this approach would take stock of its inputs and mode of production such as remixing existing cultural materials adding new content to current cultural forms or synthesizing abstract artistic motifs. Also it would consider how the work functions within its creative networks and ask whether the work is for example an object to be contemplated by others a means of communicating an idea a mode of governmental proceeding or an expressive tool meant to cause an effect. Finally it would consider how the work s creativity is valued within those networks considering questions like whether the work is an asset within a film distribution network a political commentary to be shared on social media a major work for the international art market or a ceremony meant to connect a community to the land. Once the court understands the nature of the work it would then ask what potential loss of creativity would likely result from the unauthorized appropriation. This might include loss of creative inputs and production capability loss of the ability to serve its intended expressive function and loss of creative and intellectual enrichment to the environment that produces it. These are among the questions a fact finder would need to ask to really understand the scope of the creative environment and the potential effects an unauthorized use of a work would have on current and future cultural production. The Supreme Court s majority opinion in Google LLC v. Oracle Inc. seems to indicate the Court s movement toward such an approach. There the court attempted to analyze the nature of a presumably copyrightable user interface created for computer programmers.288 Instead of merely categorizing the computer code in question as a literary work or even a computer program two terms defined by the Copyright Act289 and granting greater protection to it against unauthorized uses the court looked instead to the ontological nature of the work examining what the work is from within the work s creative environment. First the court examined the inputs and outputs that created the interface including the different kinds of computer code that made up the interface and the kinds of programming creative problemsolving vs. more functional or organizational necessary to produce each component.290 Second the Court spent considerable space describing how the user interface functions within the creative environment for computer programming. It found that the code at issue effectively acted as a system of file cabinets drawers and files for programmers organized with labels that would prove intuitively easy to remember. 291 Finally the court examined the value of the work to the creative environment for computer programming. It noted that the value of the code in question derived not necessarily from the creative investments of the authors of the user interface but from users of the interface who invested their time learning how to use the code s various commands and who continued to use it to create new programs.292  As the Supreme Court demonstrated observing how a work is generated how it functions and how it is valued should be privileged over considerations of form. This is because a fact finder s evaluation of the form a work takes may not coincide with the work s actual nature from the perspective of the creative networks that produced it. For example a ceremonial song might sound like music short samples of which might be reasonably mashed up or remixed with other songs to form a new musical work primed for the global entertainment economy when in fact it functions as the conveyance of land rights or the transmission of secret knowledge. An appropriation of such a song might disrupt governance within an entire community.293 Reconciling a work with the Copyright Act s historical subject matter categories may do little to tell us about the actual impact appropriation has on the creative environment for a work. An ontological approach allows us to see how a work is valued within its actual network of relations relations that establish the work s function mode of existence and efficacy. Admittedly a framework that delves deeper into actual or potential harms to the author or their creative environments may not sit well with advocates for an expansive public domain.294 As Professor Lessig and others have argued culture is typically conceived of as a social text a shared referent between individuals in a society that grows in meaning and value as it is freely used.295 The more a cultural referent is used and reused the more it is enriched diversified and increased in value.296 While in theory fair use should balance the public s interest in access to cultural referents against the incentives necessary for creators to produce and develop them these commentators believe fair use s factintensive inquiry in practice becomes the right to hire a lawyer thus stifling creative progress.297 Thus these scholars advocate for a fair use test that minimizes consideration of the potential harms to authors in favor of greater public access.298 While arguments for expanding the settler public domain may dismiss or refocus the second factor by making broad assumptions about the nature of authorship these arguments may not fully account for the loss of creativity that may result as creators and their creative networks particularly Indigenous ones lose confidence that their investments in creativity will be protected. The proposed approach to the second fair use factor would provide greater analytical power than our current frameworks particularly for works of Indigenous and other marginalized groups. If the normative thrust of fair use is to balance the public benefit of an appropriation against the potential harms to copyright s incentives to create this inquiry would ably inform both sides of that equation. If the creative environment for a work were stifled rendered inoperable or destroyed due to unauthorized uses of the work the authors their networks of support and the public would ultimately suffer loss of future creativity and the nature of the copyrighted work inquiry should weigh against fair use. However if the creative environment for the work thrives or benefits from modes of appropriation e.g. open source software tweets is structured so that the appropriation would have little impact on creativity e.g. shopping lists standard form contracts perhaps even academic articles or the work s production has little need for the kinds of controls against appropriation copyright offers e.g. Facebook posts online reviews an unauthorized use might not impact the creative environment at all and the nature of the copyrighted work inquiry might support fair use. The second factor of course must be weighed together with the other fair use factors which may very well counterbalance it in favor of a particularly beneficial use of a given work.299 But this proposed analysis should provide a more useful way of inserting the nature of a work into the fair use calculus in a way that serves the overarching purpose of copyright law particularly within Indigenous cultural contexts.  While an ontologically grounded second factor may improve the accuracy of the fair use analysis for many kinds of Indigenous works it alone is not a panacea for resolving disputes over which cultural appropriations should be tolerated and which should result in infringement liability. There are two key reasons for this. First evaluating the nature of a copyrighted work may admittedly be a daunting task for federal judges or juries who have no familiarity with the creative relationships or environments from which Indigenous works are generated. For example it might be difficult or impossible for fact finders to fully understand or value an Indigenous creative work and discern what might constitute harm to its creative environment without having cultivated a perspective that is inclusive of Indigenous peoples worldviews. Given the pervasiveness of antiIndigenous stereotypes in American culture having a nonIndigenous fact finder determine the fairness of an appropriation of an Indigenous work may introduce opportunities for bias that could skew the fair use analysis.300  Second the American copyright system currently makes no special normative considerations for dealing with the cultural creativity of Indigenous peoples. Thus federal judges and juries are left to make their own formulas for how to appropriately balance harms to Indigenous creative environments against the expressive interests of the American public. Given the United States legacy of disastrous attempts to unilaterally reconcile settler interests with the rights of Indigenous peoples301 deriving appropriate normative frameworks from historical federal precedent or existing federal Indian policy is unlikely to achieve a fair balance. The solution I argue is for Tribal law including statutes common law and customary law and tribal adjudicative bodies courts administrative agencies or cultural authorities where empowered to provide the normative frameworks and adjudicative mechanisms for resolving questions of fair use involving Indigenous culture rather than federal common law and federal courts. Normative questions surrounding the use of Indigenous culture may hinge on factors that are unique to individual Indigenous communities. Indeed debates over whether a particular appropriation of Indigenous culture is fair should be resolved by the communities who produce and perpetuate that culture not externally imposed by a foreign government. Thus questions about how to balance the nature of an Indigenous cultural work against the public interest should be certified to the relevant Tribal authority. Presumably local Indigenous courts will be well equipped to balance these kinds of complex ontologically diverse questions through established mechanisms that already apply the policies and norms of Indigenous communities to questions of property use unfair competition and cultural resources management.302 Tribal courts or other tribal adjudicative bodies will be able to determine whether a work is of such a nature that it should be available for a particular unauthorized appropriation or subject to the same norms as other copyrightable works as well as whether a cultural protocol or culturally specific standard of use should be applied. Even if determinations of fair use are left to federal judges courts can take steps to mitigate potential bias. In applying the second fair use factor analysis courts should focus on evidence of a work s actual ontology and harm to the work s creative environment rather than basing their decisions on the fact finder s subjective inferences about the work s predisposition to being appropriated.303 To do this stakeholders in a given work could be called on to testify as to the mode of creation and value of a work within its creative environment and the effect unauthorized appropriation has or would have on future creative output. Where the original creators are no longer participating in that creative environment those who carry such creativity forward can be called on to testify. Evaluating some creative contexts will be more complex including those where a variety of actors are implicated in a work s creation such as an environment like powwow where culture is shared across communities or where a creative environment is ontologically challenging for the fact finder such as in the realm of Indigenous ceremonial creativity. In these situations a tribal leader or other community member knowledgeable about the cultural context or a social scientist with both knowledge and binding relationships to the community might be among those to provide expert testimony regarding the effects of unauthorized appropriation on the particular creative environment. Ultimately courts should give deference to the views of Indigenous communities when assessing and weighing the nature of their copyrightable works against the other fair use factors. To understand how the proposed second fair use factor might work in concrete instances of cultural appropriation involving copyrighted Indigenous works this subpart briefly applies the fair use test to each of the cultural appropriation case studies I articulated in Part I. These include educational appropriations of powwow culture reproduction and distribution of ceremonial songs in violation of Indigenous protocols and reclamation of the voices of one s ancestors presently owned by others. As described in Part I some Boy Scout Venture Crews have taken up powwow regalia construction and dance performance as part of their educational activities copying potentially copyrightable designs from artwork they find on the internet as well as sculptural ornaments or expressive beadwork on others regalia.304 Assuming the copying by the Venture Crew members is unauthorized and the extent of the copying is actionable the Crew members would be liable for copyright infringement barring a defense of fair use or some other exception.  Under the standard fair use analysis the first and fourth factors would most likely favor the Venture Crew members with the third depending on the facts on the ground. The first fair use factor asks why the unauthorized use is occurring with a preference for those uses that are transformative in a way that advances the goals of copyright or that serve educational purposes.305 While probably not transformative in a way that alters the meaning of the original design the purpose behind the Venture Crew s copying and use of others artwork and powwow regalia elements is for the intellectual and social development of youth. Such a purpose would likely be characterized as noncommercial and educational which would typically weigh in favor of fair use.306 The fourth fair use factor which looks at how an unauthorized use will affect the market for the work would likely also weigh in favor of fair use. This is because Boy Scout appropriations are unlikely to have much of an impact on the market for powwow regalia who after all would buy powwow regalia from a nonIndigenous Boy Scout? The third factor the amount and substance copied would likely vary depending on how much of the original was copyrightable and how much of that copyrightable material was copied. But given the weight typically accorded to the first and fourth factors unless there is something about the nature of the original works that strongly weighs against fair use the Crew s unauthorized uses of these Indigenous works might be considered fair. As explained above the second fair use factor s assessment of the nature of the copyrighted work should take stock of 1 its ontological nature and creative environment such as its inputs and mode of production the function of the work within its creative networks and the way the work is valued by those networks and 2 the potential impact of unauthorized appropriation on that creative environment. Examining the ontological nature of powwow creativity reveals that it is a living and varied cultural form practiced in distinct ways by Indigenous communities and individuals across North America. It is also an appropriationbased creative form by nature. Powwow culture is said to have originated among the Omaha people in the presentday upper Midwestern United States but quickly developed as it spread to other regions as individuals learned the form and contributed new content to its musical choreographic design and literary styles.307 During times when the United States prohibited certain forms of Indigenous dance308 powwow creatives often took professional positions with Wild West shows to participate in perpetuate and develop the form.309 And when Indigenous youth across North America were removed from their homes by the federal government to attend mandatory boarding and trade schools students would come together to share and dance powwow as a means of developing common ground and unity.310 The same is true today in the urban Indigenous environments within which I have conducted research where powwows become the only Nativesanctified spaces around.311 Thus while powwow may have originated as a purely ceremonial form it is articulated and valued as a mode of collective resilience and communitybuilding throughout North America sometimes retaining its ceremonial function while in other contexts becoming a mode of artistic expression or a demonstration of cultural virtuosity. While powwow is an inclusive creative environment appropriations of powwow culture that violate local protocols regulating relationships among participants impair incentives to create. Powwow culture circulates within an economy grounded in respect attribution reciprocity and in some cases capital accumulation. Given its tradition of open sharing there is as far as I am aware no absolute bar to non Indigenous Boy Scouts drawing from the forms and styles of powwow to participate in powwow events. One need not be Indigenous to sing dance create regalia or buy goods at a powwow though preference is sometimes given for Indigenous people to sing or dance in certain powwows to the exclusion of nonIndigenous powwow goers.312 That said powwow creators do generally rely on expectations that those who use or borrow the specific instances of powwow culture they or their community create songs beadwork etc. will follow established protocols that govern the use of that culture.313 These protocols create an economy that demands payment in the form of attribution honor and respect and may sometimes require financial compensation for those who expend significant effort to create meaningful or powerful new works. Competition powwows for example provide an important income stream for participants motivating them to produce some of their most creative and innovative expressive culture while at the same time rewarding those who follow protocols of decorum and adherence to established values and aesthetic principles.314 Thus when local protocols of respect are broken or powwow creativity is used without providing the appropriate compensation the social and economic incentives to create new work are diminished. Uncompensated appropriation of powwow culture which could result from a violation of cultural protocols or the failure to pay the appropriate price for use thus negatively affects the networks that create powwow culture and the Indigenous communities that foster these creative environments. If the Boy Scouts disregarded existing protocols and negatively impact the ability of other powwow goers to participate and create within this environment this would clearly weigh against fair use. If the negative impact were significant enough it might be sufficient to outweigh the other factors. In sum whether established protocol has been followed with respect to the use of an existing cultural work should be at the heart of the second factor analysis for these sorts of educational appropriations of Indigenous culture. Laura Boulton and other early field workers gathered thousands of copyrightable works from Indigenous peoples around the world. As discussed in Part I copyright protected some of these recordings and in some cases the literary musical or dramatic works they contained.315 But given the power imbalances present in these early recording encounters many recordists including Boulton considered it unnecessary to secure written oral or even implied licenses from their Indigenous collaborators to use their recordings and other works.316 Without securing the appropriate rights to use these recordings the question now is whether unauthorized uses of these recordings can be justified under the doctrine of fair use.  Without a rehabilitated second factor Laura Boulton s unauthorized commercial release of thousands of Indigenous ceremonial song recordings through her labels Victor and Folkways may perhaps be justified under the doctrine of fair use. Looking at the first fair use factor it is clear that the purpose and character of Boulton s use of the recordings was primarily educational which would generally favor fair use. Additionally in terms of the fourth factor the effect of Boulton s release on the market for the recordings was probably quite small. It is very unlikely that Boulton s release of the recordings has usurped or would in the future usurp the market for the recordings. In fact but for Boulton s sale and distribution of them the public may never have had access to these recorded ceremonial performances.317 On the other hand Boulton did use entire recordings rather than only small samples which would typically weigh against fair use. But given the significant weight the first and the fourth factors typically have on the fair use analysis it is reasonable that they might be sufficient to tip the scale in favor of fair use. Taking into account the second fair use factor including an assessment of the ontological nature of the work and its impact on the creative environment one sees the extent of the impact unauthorized uses might have on the creative networks that generate the ceremonial performances Boulton and others recorded. Ceremonial song recordings like the ones Boulton copied and distributed are often ontologically distinct from other kinds of sound recordings like music albums film soundtracks audio books or oral history interviews. The networks that produce these kinds of recorded performances often extend far beyond typical industry players such as a composer or songwriter a performer a sound engineer and perhaps a record label music publisher or distributor. As I learned during fieldwork among Hopi ceremonial performers producing the kinds of songs Boulton recorded required spending months vocalizing in the corn fields below the Hopi villages over a growing season laboring to perfect the aesthetic of each song they sang. They then engaged in months of collaborative editing with cultural experts collectively memorizing and rehearsing the songs. In some cases performers must obtain specific authorization from political or cultural leaders before the songs can be performed in public.  These performers take these steps because unlike a typical music performance the function of ceremonial song performances is not merely to entertain they are not representations of abstract musical works. Rather these are voices of Hopi communities doing performative and generative acts which have direct effects on Hopi society and the environment even in recorded form.318 Hopi ceremonial performances are authoritative within their territory they are the material of Hopi sovereignty.319 Each step in the process of creation and performance triggers established expectations of reciprocal payment adherence to ceremonial protocols and authorities and other community obligations. If appropriation of ceremonial sound recordings outside of established protocols were permitted the economy for the creation of these kinds of ritual performances would be severely disrupted. Each actor in the creative network for a ceremonial song depends on the others for a successful ritual performance. Removing the incentives to create ceremonial performances or allowing ceremonial creativity to be used in violation of local protocols or without proper authority harms the integrity of the entire creative network and diminishes Tribal sovereignty.320 Even now while sound recording has become a useful tool for Hopi Tribal members to develop and preserve their cultural creativity Hopi villages have been forced to severely restrict documentation of ceremonies out of concerns about unauthorized appropriations. One can only imagine the harms experienced by creators when they invest in a lengthy collaborative effort to create perform and document a new ceremonial performance meticulously following community protocol only to have that recording suddenly turn up on iTunes for sale without permission and out of its appropriate cultural context. Thus in applying the rehabilitated second fair use factor to Boulton s appropriations of Hopi ceremonial culture the nature of the song recordings and the harms that would be occasioned by their unauthorized public sale should weigh heavily against fair use perhaps overcoming the other fair use factors. Standing in stark contrast to Laura Boulton s appropriations of ceremonial songs Indigenous artists have begun to generate new work from museum and archival collections which they do not own.321 Thus not only are Indigenous peoples concerned about the appropriation of their work by nonIndigenous creators they also employ appropriation in their creative process to help reverse the dispossession of cultural creativity occasioned by colonization and to promote the progress of Indigenous cultural production on their own terms. But an artist s unauthorized use of a copyrighted work owned by a museum or archive would be considered an infringement unless justified under an exception like fair use.322 A full fair use analysis of Jeremy Dutcher s use of William Mechling s anthropological recordings would be somewhat specious given that Dutcher s use of the recordings occurred in a jurisdiction that does not rely on the Copyright Act s fair use factors. But evaluating the Mechling recordings under the rehabilitated second fair use factor may provide a useful example of how the analysis might function in the context of cultural reappropriation. Dutcher sampled reworked and then integrated into his own creative material musical works and sound recordings that his Wolastoq community generated but whose copyrights it no longer owns. For example Dutcher s song Lintuwakon ciw Mehcinut samples material from a Maliseet death chant performance recorded with the assistance of anthropologist William Mechling. In some Indigenous communities a death chant like this would be restricted to only certain creative networks as determined by local law and protocol.323 But as Dutcher learned through longterm consultations with his community while the songs are highly valued in the Wolastoq community324 colonialism has dispossessed his people of their knowledge of the songs meanings and any historical protocols governing their use.325 By reappropriating and reanimating them in a balladlike style that speaks powerfully to Indigenous and non Indigenous audiences he is from the perspective of songkeepers in his community serving the urgent goal of reconnecting generations of Wolastoq community members to their culture in new ways and laying the foundation for the community s resumed cultural growth and development.326 It seems likely then that Dutcher s appropriation of Wolastoq culture will have positive effects on his Indigenous community s creative environment from whence the original songs came thus weighing in favor of fair use. Indeed the reasonable expectations of those Indigenous peoples who authored the songs he sings and the recordings they made in those early anthropological encounters may very well have been fulfilled through Dutcher s reappropriations. The recordings took place in an era when ceremonial practice was prohibited or actively discouraged by colonizing governments. Thus those who recorded for anthropologists like Mechling might have anticipated that their work would one day be used by future generations to perpetuate their Indigenous cultures again. If copyright claims were to be brought by the collectors or institutions who now claim ownership over these materials to stifle that creativity the foreclosure of a valid fair use exception would likely discourage and preclude the production of many emerging forms of Indigenous creativity going forward. Thus a per se rule excluding all appropriations of Indigenous culture from fair use will not always be beneficial to Indigenous peoples. A rehabilitated fair use factor that accounts for the ontological nature of a work and the impact of appropriation on the creative environment will provide a much fuller picture of the potential harms occasioned by an unauthorized use. Cultural appropriations may be an ordinary and ubiquitous part of human life but they also hold significant power. For Indigenous peoples whose colonization included simultaneous dispossession of land and resources alongside the widespread exploitation of their bodies identities and creativity cultural appropriation can compound experiences of settlercolonial violence while further eroding sovereignty and political autonomy. Fortunately for Indigenous groups copyright law provides some limited protection against unauthorized appropriations of some forms of culture. But copyright protection is not absolute owing in large part to doctrines like fair use. Fair use serves as a critical gatekeeping mechanism for cultural appropriations. Still the doctrine s interpretation over the last forty years may prevent judges from considering some of the most salient reasons for protecting Indigenous culture from unauthorized appropriations. Can we imagine a decolonized fair use doctrine one that serves not only settlercultural traditions and their creativeindustrial complexes but cultural production in all its varieties and natures? While new legislation that recognizes and protects the unique interests of Indigenous cultural producers is urgently needed this Article argued that copyright law can be made more fair by reorienting judicial interpretations of the fair use factor test to better account for the impact of cultural appropriations on the creative environments that generate today s diverse cultural forms. While each factor could be adjusted to better understand the unique harms cultural appropriations impose on colonized peoples the second prong of the fair use analysis the nature of the copyrighted work is already poised to take on much of this analytical work. A decolonized second fair use factor would assess a work s function and value within its particular creative environment and the impact cultural appropriation might have on that environment going forward. It is unclear why the second fair use factor has not been doing this important work all along. What is certain however is that as Indigenous and other marginalized racial ethnic and religious groups begin to contemplate copyright infringement claims against cultural appropriators fair use undoubtedly will play a key role as they assess their claims likelihood of success. The ability of courts to thoroughly analyze the natures of appropriated works in a methodologically sound way will be critical to accomplishing the constitutional goal of copyright law to promote cultural production in all its varieties. Otherwise fair use may remain yet another open door for further harmful cultural appropriations. DOI httpsdoi.org10.15779Z38V97ZS35. Copyright 2021 Trevor G. Reed.

https://floridaseminoletourism.com/cultural-appropriation-vs-cultural-appreciation/,  Connect with us Welcome to another installment in our series about the ethics around Native American art and culture! Last week we explored the American Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990 and how to be an ethical consumer of Native art. A hot topic recently cultural appropriation can be a flashy media headline we often ignore. But what is it really? This week we will explore cultural appropriation what it is and what YOU can do. Avoid falling into the trap of appropriation! Follow along for tips to respectfully appreciate Native art and culture. A news article pops up with cultural appropriation in the headline. Do you know what it means? Cultural appropriation is commonly used to identify when the imagery fashion practices music or artifacts of a culture are removed from their original context. The significance is ignored and they are taken and used by someone else. But this definition can go further than the surface level. Originally the term was mostly used in academic spaces to talk about colonialism and power dynamics between majority and minority groups. According to Rodgers 2006 there are four types of cultural appropriation exchange dominance exploitation and transculturation. In this blog post we will talk about the form we most identify with as cultural appropriation exploitation. The article s citation can be found at the end of this blog post if you would like to learn more about the other forms of cultural appropriation. The term cultural appropriation has made it out of academia and into public discourse. When you hear about cultural appropriation today it is most likely exploitation. It is the appropriation of elements of a subordinate culture without substantive reciprocity permission andor compensation Rodgers 2006. Someone from another culture takes elements of a subordinate marginalized or colonized culture. Power dynamics also come into play. Traits of the subordinate culture are cherry picked by someone of a dominant culture. Often the appropriation serves to reinforce the established power dynamic and ends up harming the marginalized culture. Unlike advertising or selling fraudulent art like we discussed last week cultural appropriation in most cases is not illegal. The difference lies in advertising if something is appropriated but they are not claiming Native heritage it is not covered by the American Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990. It can be tricky to recognize when appropriation is occurring without legal rules to hold it against. When someone appropriates something from another culture it can be through ignorance of the harm. They may be attempting to show appreciation of the culture but going about it incorrectly. Or they may not see the harm and feel like it is not a big deal. It is not illegal so why should you care? Appropriating from marginalized communities and cultures can have deeply harmful effects. Like discussed below it may take resources labor and economic opportunities from those communities. It also may lead to the fracturing of cultural identities. Appropriation perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces the power differential. It also normalizes harmful language slurs and damaging imagery. An example of this is the name change of the Washington Commanders from Washington Rword. As of February 2022 they have adopted the new Washington Commanders name and logo. But it took decades of pressure and critiques to facilitate change despite the fact the previous name included a racial slur. While they did in the end adopt a new name it did not negate the decades of damage leading up to that point. Numerous other teams also exist that perpetuate these negative stereotypes. The change of the Washington Commanders name didn t prompt sweeping change for other inappropriate team names. Native American culture isn t a monolith. Currently there are 574 federally recognized tribes in the United States. Many more tribes or bands are not state or federally recognized. Like many cultures these tribes are not all the same. While some things may be similar between two tribes they are not the same. Tribes in the Southeast like the Seminole Tribe of Florida and Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida can have significantly different practices clothing styles and language from a tribe from a different part of the country. One harmful effect of the normalization of cultural appropriation is ignorance of these differences. By buying an Indian costume to wear for Halloween you are participating in the erasure of many vibrant cultures and practices. Many nonnatives are ignorant of Native cultural practices or even that these cultural practices still exist at all. To often not even have a seat at the table and yet still have aspects of your culture taken and exploited for other s gain can be extremely damaging.  The fashion industry often appropriates Native designs fashions and imagery without attribution. People interacting with the items have no context for the original intention. Aspects of many cultures may be blended together. Companies or people with no affiliation profit from this appropriation. The It s Not A Costume Modern Seminole Patchwork exhibit originally on exhibit from December 2014November 2015 was cocurated by artist Jessica Osceola Seminole and former Curator of Exhibits Rebecca Fell of the AhTahThiKi Museum. This exhibit explores the concept of design appropriation of Seminole patchwork. According to the online exhibit theft of tribal designs are hurting tribal arts artists and more importantly the identity of the tribal people. Not only does it undermine their sovereign right to their own cultural practices this theft also profits off of their labor without compensation or attribution. For the Seminoles the online exhibit reads the patchwork design is diluted and becomes less meaningful when others wear or create it without an understanding of its history.  Does this mean you can t appreciate other cultures at all? Of course not! But there is a fine line between appropriation and appreciation. To appreciate other cultures you need to do the work to honor and respect the culture and its people. It is a learning experience where you gain knowledge and deepen your understanding over time. As an example it is stated in the It s Not A Costume exhibit that buying authentic works and supporting the original artist is an essential practice. We know this is the best way to ethically purchase Native arts and crafts. See our post last week for more info. But it also means that the way you are engaging with the culture is from a space of respect and not appropriation. Some designs are attributed to a particular artist or hold a special meaning within Seminole patchwork. To properly appreciate Seminole culture in this context you need to make sure you are being sensitive and honoring. Do not purchase fraudulent or stolen designs as you may not have the moral right to own or display them. Avoid items that are culturally significant that you do not have the right to wear or own. Chances are if you are asking yourself these questions you are not Seminole. Therefore you need to engage with that culture from the space you inhabit instead of attempting to coopt aspects of the culture for yourself. One of the best things you can do to avoid appropriating from other cultures is pay attention and be mindful. Critically think about your choices. As yourself Do they play into racial or cultural stereotypes? Are you profiting off of someone else s culture? Is someone else profiting off of a culture that is not their own? If you are wearing a fashion or piece of clothing from another culture reflect and think how it got to be in your wardrobe. Be mindful of items that may be culturally sensitive or spiritual. Stand up when you see someone being insensitive and appropriating another culture. Use your power to engage in conversations about appropriation. Reflect and examine if you are being genuine and sincere in your appreciation. Do you just want to engage with it because it s trendy? Or are you doing the work to learn about the culture and practices? All too often people think of Native or indigenous people as only existing in the past. They mentally delegate them to history books. This could not be more wrong! Native people are still around. Remember that you can appreciate these cultures in real time. Attend events hosted by tribes visit their museums buy arts and crafts from Native artisans and meet people! Instead of learning about them from careless stereotypical representations show up and learn from them yourself. While cultural appropriation is a heavy topic it is an important one to discuss. Talking about issues like this are imperative for working towards a more respectful honoring and inclusive world. Like when purchasing Native arts and crafts the most important thing you can do is be a critical thinker about your own actions. Take responsibility for what you do. Best of all do the work to learn and engage with other cultures in a respectful and appreciative manner. Next week join us for the final installment in our Ethics and Native cultures series as we talk about How to be an Ethical Ecotourist in Indian Country! Look back on the first installment about Ethical consumption of Native Arts and Crafts here. Rogers R.A. 2006. From cultural exchange to transculturation A review and reconceptualization of cultural appropriation. Communication Theory 16 474503 Allies for Indian Country National Congress of American Indians Native Appropriations Representations Matter Cultural appropriation refers to the act of taking elements of a culture that is not one s own without permission or understanding of the original culture s meaning and significance. It can be seen as a form of exploitation and can be hurtful to members of the culture from which the elements were taken. It often perpetuates harmful stereotypes and reinforces power imbalances. Cultural appreciation on the other hand refers to a respectful and meaningful engagement with the practices and traditions of a culture that is not one s own. It involves learning about and valuing the culture for its own sake rather than using it for personal gain or profit. Cultural appreciation can lead to mutual understanding and respect and can foster a sense of connection and shared humanity between different cultures. It is important to understand the difference between these two concepts and to be mindful of one s actions and intentions when engaging with different cultures. It is important to respect and honor the significance of cultural traditions and customs and to seek permission and understanding before participating in or appropriating them.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_appropriation, Cultural appropriation 1 2 is the inappropriate or unacknowledged adoption of an element or elements of one culture or identity by members of another culture or identity. 3 4 5 This can be especially controversial when members of a dominant culture appropriate from minority cultures. 6 1 7 8 According to critics of the practice cultural appropriation differs from acculturation assimilation or equal cultural exchange in that this appropriation is a form of colonialism. When cultural elements are copied from a minority culture by members of a dominant culture and these elements are used outside of their original cultural context sometimes even against the expressly stated wishes of members of the originating culture the practice is often received negatively. 9 10 11 12 13  Cultural appropriation is considered harmful by various groups and individuals 14 including some Indigenous people working for cultural preservation 15 16 those who advocate for collective intellectual property rights of the originating minority cultures 17 18 19 20 and some of those who have lived or are living under colonial rule. 1 21 22 20 Cultural appropriation can include exploitation of another cultures religious and cultural traditions dance steps fashion symbols language and music. 23  Those who see this appropriation as exploitative state that cultural elements are lost or distorted when they are removed from their originating cultural contexts and that such displays are disrespectful or even a form of desecration. 9 Cultural elements that may have deep meaning to the original culture may be reduced to exotic fashion or toys by those from the dominant culture. 9 10 24 Kjerstin Johnson has written that when this is done the imitator who does not experience that oppression is able to play temporarily an exotic other without experiencing any of the daily discriminations faced by other cultures. 24 The black American academic musician and journalist Greg Tate argued that appropriation and the fetishising of cultures in fact alienates those whose culture is being appropriated. 25  The concept of cultural appropriation has also been subject to heavy criticism and debate. 26 27 28 Critics note that the concept is often misunderstood or misapplied by the general public and that charges of cultural appropriation are at times misapplied to situations such as trying food from a different culture or learning about different cultures. 29 30 Others state that the act of cultural appropriation as it is usually defined does not meaningfully constitute social harm or the term lacks conceptual coherence. 31 32 Additionally the term can set arbitrary limits on intellectual freedom artists selfexpression reinforce group divisions or promote a feeling of enmity or grievance rather than of liberation. 32 33 34 35 27  Cultural appropriation can involve the use of ideas symbols artifacts or other aspects of humanmade visual or nonvisual culture. 37 As a concept that is controversial in its applications the propriety of cultural appropriation has been the subject of much debate. Opponents of cultural appropriation view many instances as wrongful appropriation when the subject culture is a minority culture or is subordinated in social political economic or military status to the dominant culture 24 or when there are other issues involved such as a history of ethnic or racial conflict. 10 Linda Mart n Alcoff writes that this is often seen in cultural outsiders use of an oppressed cultures symbols or other cultural elements such as music dance spiritual ceremonies modes of dress speech and social behaviour when these elements are trivialized and used for fashion rather than respected within their original cultural context. Opponents view the issues of colonialism context and the difference between appropriation and mutual exchange as central to analyzing cultural appropriation. They argue that mutual exchange happens on an even playing field whereas appropriation involves pieces of an oppressed culture being taken out of context by a people who have historically oppressed those they are taking from and who lack the cultural context to properly understand respect or utilize these elements. 10 14  Another view of cultural appropriation is that calling upon it to criticise is a deeply conservative project despite progressive roots that first seeks to preserve in formaldehyde the content of an established culture and second tries to prevent others from interacting with that culture. 38  The Oxford English Dictionary s earliest citation for the phrase was a 1945 essay by Arthur E. Christy which discussed Orientalism. 39 40 The term became widespread in the 1980s in discussions of postcolonial critiques of Western expansionism 39 41 though the concept of cultural colonialism had been explored earlier such as in Some General Observations on the Problems of Cultural Colonialism by Kenneth Coutts Smith in 1976. 41 42  Cultural and racial theorist George Lipsitz has used the term strategic antiessentialism to refer to the calculated use of a cultural form outside of ones own to define oneself or ones group. Strategic antiessentialism can be seen in both minority cultures and majority cultures and is not confined only to the use of the other. However Lipsitz argues when the majority culture attempts to strategically antiessentialize itself by appropriating a minority culture it must take great care to recognize the specific sociohistorical circumstances and significance of these cultural forms so as not to perpetuate the already existing majority vs. minority unequal power relations. 43  A common example of cultural appropriation is the adoption of the iconography of another culture and using it for purposes that are unintended by the original culture or even offensive to that cultures mores. Examples include sports teams using Native American tribal names or images as mascots people not from the originating culture wearing jewelry or fashion that incorporates religious symbols such as the medicine wheel or wearing items of deep cultural significance and status that must be earned such as a war bonnet without having earned the right. 44 Authentic Native American war bonnets are sacred ceremonial items earned by people of high status in a traditional tribal society much like military medals. People from cultures who have this sacred regalia usually consider it disrespectful and offensive when someone who has not earned the right to wear one dons an authentic or imitation headdress whether as part of pretending to be Native American or as a costume or fashion statement. 44 45 Copying iconography from another cultures history such as Polynesian tribal tattoos Chinese characters or Celtic art worn without regard to their original cultural significance may also be considered appropriation. Critics of the practice of cultural appropriation contend that divorcing this iconography from its cultural context or treating it as kitsch risks offending people who venerate and wish to preserve their cultural traditions. 46 47  In Australia Aboriginal artists have discussed an authenticity brand to ensure consumers are aware of artworks claiming false Aboriginal significance. 48 49 The movement for such a measure gained momentum after the 1999 conviction of John OLoughlin for selling paintings that he falsely described as the work of Aboriginal artist Clifford Possum Tjapaltjarri. 50 In Canada visual artist Sue Coleman has garnered negative attention for appropriating and amalgamating styles of Indigenous art into her work. Coleman who has been accused of copying and selling Indigenousstyle artwork has described herself as a translator of Indigenous art forms which drew further criticism. In his open letter to Coleman KwakwakawakwSalish Artist Carey Newman stressed the importance of artists being accountable within the Indigenous communities as the antidote to appropriation. 51  Historically some of the most hotly debated cases of cultural appropriation have occurred in places where cultural exchange is the highest such as along the trade routes in southwestern Asia and southeastern Europe. Some scholars of the Ottoman Empire and ancient Egypt argue that Ottoman and Egyptian architectural traditions have long been falsely claimed and praised as Persian or Arab. 52   Many Native Americans have criticized what they deem to be the cultural appropriation of their sweat lodge and vision quest ceremonies by nonNatives and even by tribes who have not traditionally had these ceremonies. They contend that there are serious safety risks whenever these events are conducted by those who lack the many years of training and cultural immersion required to lead them safely mentioning the deaths or injuries in 1996 2002 2004 and several highprofile deaths in 2009. 53  Cultural appropriation is controversial in the fashion industry due to the belief that some trends commercialise and cheapen the ancient heritage of Indigenous cultures. 54 There is debate about whether designers and fashion houses understand the history behind the clothing they are taking from different cultures besides the ethical issues of using these cultures shared intellectual property without consent acknowledgement or compensation. 55 According to MinhHa T. Pham writing for The Atlantic accusations of cultural appropriation are often defended as cultural appreciation instead. 56  The necktie or cravat was derived from a scarf worn by Croatian mercenaries fighting for Louis XIII 57 and the brightly coloured silk waistcoats popularised by Charles II of England were inspired by Turkish Indian and Persian attire acquired by wealthy English travellers. 58  During the Victorian era the British aristocracy appropriated traditional Highland dress after the forced removal of the indigenous population during the Highland clearances. Tartan was given the spurious association with specific Highland Clans after publications such as James Logans romanticised work The Scottish Gael 1831 led the Scottish tartan industry to invent clan tartans 59 and tartan became a desirable material for dresses waistcoats and cravats. In America plaid flannel had become workwear by the time of Westward expansion and was widely worn by Old West pioneers and cowboys who were not of Scottish descent. 60 In the 21st century tartan remains ubiquitous in mainstream fashion. 61  By the 19th century the fascination had shifted to Asian culture. English Regency era dandies adapted the Indian churidars into slim fitting pantaloons and frequently wore turbans within their own houses. Later Victorian gentlemen wore smoking caps based on the Islamic fez and fashionable turn of the century ladies wore Orientalist 62 Japanese inspired kimono dresses. 63 64 Moreover this obsession with orientalism was visible with how one company named its passenger shipping line The Orient Line. 65 During the tiki culture fad of the 1950s white women frequently donned the qipao to give the impression that they had visited Hong Kong although the dresses were frequently made by seamstresses in America using rayon rather than genuine silk. At the same time teenage British Teddy Girls wore Chinese coolie hats due to their exotic connotations. 66  In Mexico the sombrero associated with the mestizo peasant class was adapted from an earlier hat introduced by the Spanish colonials during the 18th century. 67 This in turn was adapted into the cowboy hat worn by American cowboys after the US Civil War. 67 In 2016 the University of East Anglia prohibited the wearing of sombreros to parties on campus in the belief that these could offend Mexican students 32 a move that was widely criticized. 68 69 70  American Western wear was copied from the work attire of 19th century Mexican Vaqueros especially the pointed cowboy boots and the guayabera which was adapted into the embroidered Western shirt. 71 The China poblana dress associated with Mexican women was appropriated from the choli and lehenga worn by Indian maidservants like Catarina de San Juan who arrived from Asia from the 17th century onwards. 72  In Britain the rough tweed cloth clothing of the Irish English and Scottish peasantry including the flat cap and Irish hat 73 were appropriated by the upper classes as the British country clothing worn for sports such as hunting or fishing in imitation of the then Prince of Wales. 74 The country clothing in turn was appropriated by the wealthy American Ivy League and later preppy subcultures during the 1950s and 1980s due to both its practicality and its association with the English elite. 75 During the same period the British comedian Tommy Cooper was known for wearing a Fez throughout his performances. When keffiyehs became popular in the late 2000s experts made a clear distinction between the wearing of a genuine scarf and a fake made in China. 76 Palestinian independence activists and socialists denounced the wearing of scarves not made in Palestine as a form of cultural appropriation but encouraged fellow Muslims and progressively minded nonMuslim students 77 to buy shemaghs made in the Herbawi 78 factory to demonstrate solidarity with the Palestinian people and improve the economy of the West Bank. 79 80 In 2017 Topshop caused controversy by selling Chinesemade playsuits that imitated the pattern of the keffiyeh. 81  Israeli cuisine has been accused of culturally appropriating various types of Palestinian and other Arab food with a notable example being falafel. 82  Several fashion designers and models have featured imitations of Native American warbonnets in their fashion shows 83 84 such as Victorias Secret in 2012 when model Karlie Kloss wore one during her walk on the runway a Navajo Nation spokesman called it a mockery. 85 Cherokee academic Adrienne Keene wrote in The New York Times For the Native American communities that wear these headdresses they represent respect power and responsibility. The headdress has to be earned and gifted to a leader in whom the community has placed their trust. When it becomes a cheap commodity anyone can buy and wear to a party that meaning is erased and disrespected and Native peoples are reminded that our cultures are still seen as something of the past as unimportant in contemporary society and unworthy of respect. 83 84  Both Victorias Secret and Kloss issued apologies stating that they had no intentions of offending anyone. 85 86  The culturally significant Hindu festival Holi has been imitated and incorporated into fashion globally. For example pop artist Pharrell Williams and Adidas collaborated in 2018 to create the Holiinspired apparel and shoe line Hu Holi. The collection was stated to be a trivialization of traditionsconceptssymbolsbeliefs of Hinduism according to Raja Zed president of the Universal Society of Hinduism. The collection included many items which contained leather a violation of Hindu beliefs. 87  Archbishop Justin Welby of the Anglican Church said that the crucifix is now just a fashion statement and has lost its religious meaning. 88 Crucifixes have been incorporated into Japanese lolita fashion by nonChristians in a cultural context that is distinct from its original meaning as a Christian religious symbol. 89  In 2018 Gucci designers were criticised for sending white models for a catwalk at Milan fashion week wearing a Sikh religious headpiece. 90 91 92 Thousands of members from the Sikh community shared anger and disappointment that the brand had used Sikh sacred religious symbol for profit. 90 Traditionally in Sikhism a turban is worn by both men and women as a symbol of piety honour and spirituality however many people from Sikh community including Avan Jogia found it offensive and irresponsible for a white model wearing a turban. 91  While the history of colonization and marginalization is not unique to the Americas the practice of nonNative sports teams deriving team names imagery and mascots from Indigenous peoples is still common in the United States and Canada and has persisted in some extent despite protests from Indigenous groups. Cornel Pewewardy Professor and Director of Indigenous Nations Studies at Portland State University cites Indigenous mascots as an example of dysconscious racism which by placing images of Native American or First Nations people into an invented media context continues to maintain the superiority of the dominant culture. 98 It is argued that such practices maintain the power relationship between the dominant culture and the Indigenous culture and can be seen as a form of cultural imperialism. 99 100  Such practices may be seen as particularly harmful in schools and universities that have a stated purpose of promoting ethnic diversity and inclusion. 101 In recognition of the responsibility of higher education to eliminate behaviors that create a hostile environment for education in 2005 the NCAA initiated a policy against hostile and abusive names and mascots that led to the change of many derived from Native American culture with the exception of those that established an agreement with particular tribes for the use of their specific names. Other schools retain their names because they were founded for the education of Native Americans and continue to have a significant number of Indigenous students. The trend towards the elimination of Indigenous names and mascots in local schools has been steady with twothirds having been eliminated over the past 50 years according to the National Congress of American Indians NCAI. 102  In contrast the Seminole Tribe of Florida in what the Washington Post called an unusual move approved of the Florida State Seminoles use of their historical leader Osceola and his Appaloosa horse as the mascots Osceola and Renegade. 103 104 After the NCAA attempted to ban the use of Native American names and iconography in college sports in 2005 the Seminole Tribe of Florida passed a resolution offering explicit support for FSUs depiction of aspects of Florida Seminole culture and Osceola as a mascot. The university was granted a waiver citing the close relationship with and ongoing consultation between the team and the Florida tribe. 104 In 2013 the tribes chairman objected to outsiders meddling in tribal approval stating that the FSU mascot and use of Florida State Seminole iconography represents the courage of the people who were here and are still here known as the Unconquered Seminoles. 105 Conversely in 2013 the Seminole Nation of Oklahoma expressed disapproval of the use of all American Indian sportsteam mascots in the public school system by college and university level and by professional sports teams. Additionally not all members of the Florida State Seminoles are supportive of the stance taken by their leadership on this issue. 103 104  In other former colonies in Asia Africa and South America the adoption of Indigenous names for majority Indigenous teams is also found. There are also ethnicallyrelated team names derived from prominent immigrant populations in the area such as the Boston Celtics the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Minnesota Vikings. The phenomenon of white people adopting elements of black culture has been prevalent at least since slavery was abolished in the Western world. The concept has been documented in the United States Canada the United Kingdom Australia and other whitemajority countries. An early form of this was the white negro in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s as examined in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay The White Negro. It was later seen in the zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s the hipster of the 1940s the beatnik of the 1950s 1960s the blueeyed soul of the 1970s and the hip hop of the 1980s and 1990s. In 1993 an article in the UK newspaper The Independent described the phenomenon of white middleclass kids who were wannabe Blacks. 106 The year 2005 saw the publication of Why White Kids Love Hip Hop Wangstas Wiggers Wannabes and the New Reality of Race in America by Bakari Kitwana a culture critic whos been tracking American hip hop for years. 107  The term wigger common spelling wigga is a slang term for a white person who adopts the mannerisms language and fashions associated with African American culture particularly hip hop and in Britain the grime scene often implying the imitation is being done badly although usually with sincerity rather than mocking intent. 108 109 110 Wigger is a portmanteau of white and nigger or nigga and the related term wangsta is a mashup of wannabe or white and gangsta. Among black hiphop fans the word nigga can sometimes be considered a friendly greeting but when used by white people as well as nonblack people of color it is usually viewed as offensive. 111 Wigger may be derogatory reflecting stereotypes of African American Black British and white culture when used as a synonym of white trash. The term may be used by white people to belittle those perceived as acting black and by black people to belittle those perceived as mocking black culture. 112  Robert A. Clifts documentary Blacking Up HipHops Remix of Race and Identity questions white enthusiasts of black hiphop culture. Clifts documentary examines racial and cultural ownership and authenticity a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of Stephen Foster Al Jolson Benny Goodman Elvis Presley the Rolling Stones up to Vanilla Ice ... and Eminem. 113 A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as white poseurs and states that the term wigger is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hiphop culture. 113  African Americans have been accused of cultural appropriation by people from Africa. This has been disputed as members of the diaspora have claimed a link to Africa but those from Africa have disputed it. 114  The term blackfishing was popularised in 2018 by writer Wanna Thompson describing female white social media influencers who adopt a look perceived to be associated with black people including braided hair dark skin from tanning or makeup full lips and large thighs. Critics argue they take attention and opportunities from black influencers by appropriating their aesthetics and have likened the trend to blackface. 115 116 117 Florida State Universitys Alisha Gaines author of Black for a Day Fantasies of Race and Empathy said blackfishing allowed nonBlack people to appropriate what is commonly considered cool about Blackness while still avoiding the negative consequences such as racism and state violence. 118 According to Health.com it is an inverse form of passing. 118  Among critics the misuse and misrepresentation of indigenous cultures are seen as an exploitative form of colonialism and one step in the destruction of Indigenous cultures. 119  The results of this appropriation of Indigenous knowledge have led some tribes and the United Nations General Assembly to issue several declarations on the subject. The Declaration of War Against Exploiters of Lakota Spirituality includes the passage We assert a posture of zerotolerance for any white mans shaman who rises from within our own communities to authorize the expropriation of our ceremonial ways by nonIndians all such plastic medicine men are enemies of the Lakota Dakota and Nakota people. 15 120  Article 31 1 of the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples states Indigenous peoples have the right to maintain control protect and develop their cultural heritage traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions as well as the manifestations of their sciences technologies and cultures including human and genetic resources seeds medicines knowledge of the properties of fauna and flora oral traditions literatures designs sports and traditional games and visual and performing arts. They also have the right to maintain control protect and develop their intellectual property over such cultural heritage traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions. 21  In 2015 a group of Native American academics and writers stated the Rainbow Family members whose acts of cultural exploitation... dehumanize us as an indigenous Nation because they imply our culture and humanity like our land is anyones for the taking. 121  In writing about Indigenous intellectual property for the Native American Rights Fund NARF board member Professor Rebecca Tsosie stresses the importance of these property rights being held collectively not by individuals The longterm goal is to actually have a legal system and certainly a treaty could do that that acknowledges two things. Number one it acknowledges that indigenous peoples are people with a right to selfdetermination that includes governance rights over all property belonging to the indigenous people. And number two it acknowledges that indigenous cultural expressions are a form of intellectual property and that traditional knowledge is a form of intellectual property but they are collective resources so not any one individual can give away the rights to those resources. The tribal nations actually own them collectively. 20  In 2013 pop star Katy Perry drew heavy criticism for her geishastyle performance at the American Music Awards in which she and her backup dancers donned kimonos heavy powdered face makeup and colorful parasols among other East Asian cultural items. Netizens declared Perrys actions appropriative and harmful to East Asian cultures. 122  In 2016 pop star Beyonc was widely criticized for wearing a sari and bindi in the music video for the Coldplay song Hymn For the Weekend. 123  From 2020 to the present there has been a persistent issue regarding the white adoption and convolution of Hindu a religion originating from South Asia religious practices coining them with the umbrella term of spirituality. These were practices including the usage of the Evil Eye Hamsa etc. that people growing up as Hindus report being bullied for in their past and even the present. 11 page needed  The adoption of First Nations art forms and strong geometric forms was in sympathy with the Arts and Crafts Societys commitment to modernist design but without serious consideration of the ethics of the appropriation of Aboriginal motifs by Western artists. 124 125 During the 1930s Margaret Preston advocated the use of Indigenous Australian motifs in contemporary art in her 1930 essay The Application of Aboriginal Designs in Art in Australia. 126 127 The works of other artists like Allan Lowe borrowed or copied Aboriginal motifs Lowe a potter drew inspiration from Aboriginal arts from Charles P. Mountfords expedition photographs while Olive Nock who attended the 1925 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts D coratifs et Industriels Modernes incorporated Aboriginal designs into a tea service. In March 1929 Frances Derham designed the cover of the Victorian Arts and Crafts Society journal The Recorder which featured Aboriginal motifs. 128 124 Also that year she presented a lecture titled The Interest of Aboriginal Art to the Modern Designer to the Society in which she recounted her examination of Aboriginal material culture and its inspiration for her subsequent artistic expressions in linocuts of the 1920s to the 1940s which featured Aboriginal motifs. She twice visited the Aboriginal Art Exhibition at the National Museum of Victoria in July 1929 129 and is believed to have inspired students work based on Aboriginal motifs displayed at the Arts and Crafts Societys annual exhibition. By the 1940s there was an increasing acceptance of Aboriginal material culture as an art form alongside Western traditions 130 in 1941 Aboriginal works were included for the first time in a survey Art of Australia 17881941 that toured the United States and Canada. 131 132 133  In China there is longstanding resentment of the Japanese schools of karate for stealing imitating and claiming credit for the forms of kung fu. 134 Before the 1970s most sifu disapproved of teaching kung fu to nonChinese students. 135 In the mid20th century Japanese karate was itself appropriated by American soldiers. 136 As mixed martial arts gained popularity in the 21st century practitioners have appropriated and combined Chinese Japanese and Thai techniques with Westernstyle boxing wrestling and kickboxing. 137  Use of minority languages has been cited as cultural appropriation. The widespread use of the term woke among white people has been highlighted as problematic citation needed since it originates in AfricanAmerican Vernacular English. Although woke adherents would advocate vigilance against cultural appropriation white people using the term may paradoxically be considered to be adopting an element of AfricanAmerican culture inappropriately. 138  The appropriation of language in tattoos has been called into question. Since the early 2000s it has become increasingly popular for people not of East Asian or South Asian descent to get tattoos of Devanagari Korean letters or Han characters traditional simplified or Japanese often without knowing the actual meaning of the symbols being used. 139 140 In 2000 footballer David Beckham received a tattoo in Hindi. 141 Beckham does not have Indian heritage. 142  In Scotland and Ireland nonspeakers of Scottish Gaelic or Irish get tattoos in those languages often not understanding what their tattoos mean. 143  In Scotland the use of incorrect Scottish Gaelic in a tokenistic fashion aimed at nonGaelic speakers on signage and announcements has been criticized as disrespectful to fluent speakers of the language. 144  In 2017 Ghost in the Shell which is based on the seinen manga Ghost in the Shell by Masamune Shirow provoked disputes over whitewashing. Scarlett Johansson a white actress took the role of Motoko Kusanagi a Japanese character. 145 This was seen as cultural appropriation by some Western fans of the original manga who expected the role to be taken by an Asian or AsianAmerican actor. 145 However Japanese fans reaction ranged from neutral to warm feelings about Scarlett Johansson starring in the film with some fans expressing the sentiment that it would be better to have an actress with no ties to Asia play the character than to have a nonJapanese Asian pretend to be Japanese. 146  During Halloween some people buy wear and sell Halloween costumes based on cultural or racial stereotypes. 147 148 24 149 There have been public protests calling for the end to the manufacture and sales of these costumes and connecting their degrading portrayals of Indigenous women to the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women MMIW crisis. 149 In some cases theme parties have been held where attendees are encouraged to dress up as stereotypes of a certain racial group. 147 148 A number of these parties have been held at colleges and at times other than Halloween including Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Black History Month. 147 148 For example nonRomani people wear Romani costumes despite Romani people experiencing everyday racism and stereotypes. 150  In chapter four of his book Playing Indian Native American historian Philip J. Deloria refers to the Koshare Indian Museum and Dancers as an example of object hobbyists who adopt the material culture of Indigenous peoples of the past the vanishing Indian while failing to engage with contemporary native peoples or acknowledge the history of conquest and dispossession. 151 152 In the 1950s the head councilman of the Zuni Pueblo saw a performance and said We know your hearts are good but even with good hearts you have done a bad thing. In Zuni culture religious objects and practices are only for those that have earned the right to participate following techniques and prayers that have been handed down for generations. 153 In 2015 the Koshares Winter Night dances were canceled after a late request was received from Cultural Preservation Office CPO of the Hopi Nation asking that the troop discontinue their interpretation of the dances of the Hopi and Pueblo Native Americans. 154 Director of the CPO Leigh Kuwanwisiwma saw video of the performances online and said the performers were mimicking our dances but they were insensitive as far as Im concerned. 16 In both instances unable to satisfy the concerns of the tribes and out of respect for the Native Americans the Koshare Dance Team complied with the requests removed dances found to be objectionable and even went so far as to give items deemed culturally significant to the tribes. 153 16 Subsequently the Koshare have resumed their performance schedule without having further communications with Native Americans. 155  The objections from some Native Americans towards such dance teams center on the idea that the dance performances are a form of cultural appropriation that places dance and costumes in inappropriate contexts devoid of their true meaning sometimes mixing elements from different tribes. 156 In contrast the dance teams state that their goal is to preserve Native American dance and heritage through the creation of dance regalia dancing and teaching others about the Native American culture. 157  People in the transgender community have protested against the casting of straight cisgender actors in trans acting roles such as when Eddie Redmayne played the role of artist Lili Elbe in the film The Danish Girl and when Jared Leto played the role of a trans woman named Rayon in Dallas Buyers Club. 158 Some in the gay community have expressed concerns about the use of straight actors to play gay characters this occurs in films such as Call Me by Your Name straight actors Armie Hammer and Timoth e Chalamet Brokeback Mountain Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal Philadelphia Tom Hanks Capote Philip Seymour Hoffman and Milk with Sean Penn playing the role of the reallife gay rights activist Harvey Milk. 159 In the other direction gay actors playing straight roles Andrew Haigh the writerdirector said You rarely see a gay actor applauded for playing straight. 160 Jay Caruso calls these controversies wholly manufactured on the grounds that the actors are playing a role using the art of acting. 158  Some heterosexual individuals controversially selfidentify by the term queer heterosexual. 161 162 As queer is generally defined either as a synonym for LGBT 163 164 or defined as nonheterosexual 165 this appropriation of queer by cisgender heterosexual individuals has been highly contested by LGBT people. 166 One reason is that the term has a long history of use as a slur of LGBT people. 167 LGBT people who consider this use of the term queer by heterosexual people to be inappropriate say that it is patently offensive because it involves members of the dominant culture who do not experience oppression for their sexual orientation or gender identity appropriating what they see as the fashionable parts of the terminology and identities of those who are oppressed for their sexuality. 166  For someone who is homosexual and queer a straight person identifying as queer can feel like choosing to appropriate the good bits the cultural and political cache sic the clothes and the sound of gay culture without the laugh riot of gaybashing teen shame adult shame shameshame and the internalized homophobia of lived gay experience. 166  The government of Ghana has been accused of cultural appropriation in adopting the Caribbean Emancipation Day and marketing it to African American tourists as an African festival. 168  For some members of the South Asian community the wearing of a bindi dot as a decorative item by a nonHindu can be seen as cultural appropriation. 169  A term among Irish people for someone who imitates or misrepresents Irish culture is Plastic Paddy. 170 171 172  In 2011 a group of students at Ohio University started a poster campaign denouncing the use of cultural stereotypes as costumes. The campaign features people of colour alongside their respective stereotypes with slogans such as This is not who I am and this is not okay. 173 The goal of the movement was to raise awareness around racism during Halloween in the university and the surrounding community but the images also circulated online. 174  Reclaim the Bindi has become a hashtag used by some people of South Asian descent who wear traditional garb and object to its use by people not of their culture. At the 2014 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival one of the most noted fashion trends was the bindi a traditional Hindu headmark. 175 As pictures of the festival surfaced online there was public controversy over the casual wearing of the bindi by nonHindu individuals who did not understand the meaning behind it. 176 Reclaim the Bindi Week is an event which seeks to promote the traditional cultural significance of the bindi and combat its use as a fashion statement. 177  John McWhorter an AfricanAmerican professor at Columbia University criticized the concept in 2014 arguing that cultural borrowing and crossfertilization is a generally positive thing and is something which is usually done out of admiration and with no intent to harm the cultures being imitated he also argued that the specific term appropriation which can mean theft is misleading when applied to something like culture that is not seen by all as a limited resource. 31  In 2018 conservative columnist Jonah Goldberg described cultural appropriation as a positive thing and dismissed opposition to it as a product of some peoples desire to be offended. 178  Kwame Anthony Appiah ethics columnist for the New York Times said that the term cultural appropriation incorrectly labels contemptuous behavior as a property crime. According to Appiah The key question in the use of symbols or regalia associated with another identity group is not What are my rights of ownership? Rather its Are my actions disrespectful? 179 180  In 2016 author Lionel Shriver said that authors from a cultural majority have a right to write in the voice of someone from a cultural minority attacking the idea that this constitutes cultural appropriation. Referring to a case in which U.S. college students were facing disciplinary action for wearing sombreros to a tequila party she said The moral of the sombrero scandals is clear youre not supposed to try on other peoples hats. Yet thats what were paid to do isnt it? Step into other peoples shoes and try on their hats. 32 181  Upon winning the 2019 Booker Prize Bernardine Evaristo dismissed the concept of cultural appropriation stating that it is ridiculous to demand of writers that they not write beyond their own culture. 182 
https://www.thoughtco.com/cultural-appropriation-and-why-iits-wrong-2834561, Cultural appropriation is the adoption of certain elements from another culture without the consent of people who belong to that culture. Its a controversial topic one that activists and celebrities like Adrienne Keene and Jesse Williams have helped bring into the national spotlight. However much of the public remains confused about what the term actually means. People from hundreds of different ethnicities make up the U.S. population so it s not surprising that cultural groups rub off on each other at times. Americans who grow up in diverse communities may pick up the dialect customs and religious traditions of the cultural groups that surround them. Cultural appropriation is an entirely different matter. It has little to do with one s exposure to and familiarity with different cultures. Instead cultural appropriation typically involves members of a dominant group exploiting the culture of less privileged groups. Quite often this is done along racial and ethnic lines with little understanding of the latter s history experience and traditions. In order to understand cultural appropriation we must first look at the two words that make up the term. Culture is defined as the beliefs ideas traditions speech and material objects associated with a particular group of people. Appropriation is the illegal unfair or unjust taking of something that doesnt belong to you. Susan Scafidi a law professor at Fordham University told Jezebel that it s difficult to give a concise explanation of cultural appropriation. The author of Who Owns Culture? Appropriation and Authenticity in American Law defined cultural appropriation as follows  In the United States cultural appropriation almost always involves members of the dominant culture or those who identify with it borrowing from the cultures of minority groups. Black people Asians Latinxs and Native Americans generally tend to emerge as the groups targeted for cultural appropriation. Black music and dance Native American fashions decoration and cultural symbols Chicano style and fashion and Asian martial arts and dress have all fallen prey to cultural appropriation.  Borrowing is a key component of cultural appropriation and there are many examples in recent American history. However it can be traced back to the racial beliefs of early America an era when many white people saw people of color as less than human and the federal government codified that ideology into law. Society has yet to move completely beyond those gross injustices. And insensitivity to the historical and current sufferings of marginalized groups remains apparent today. In the 1950s white musicians appropriated the music their Black counterparts invented. Because racism relegated Black people to the sidelines of U.S. society record executives chose to have White artists replicate the sound of Black musicians. The result is that music like rocknroll is largely associated with White people and its Black pioneers like Little Richard are denied the credit for the contributions that they deserve. In the early 21st century cultural appropriation remains a concern. Musicians such as Madonna Gwen Stefani and Miley Cyrus have all been accused of cultural appropriation. Madonnas famous voguing began in Black and Latinx sectors of the gay club scene in New York City and Gwen Stefani has faced criticism for her fixation on Harajuku culture from Japan. In 2013 Miley Cyrus became the pop star most associated with cultural appropriation. During recorded and live performances the former child star began to twerk a dance style with roots in the African American community. Native American fashion art and rituals have also been appropriated into mainstream U.S. culture. Major corporations have reproduced and sold indigenous fashions for profit and eclectic religious and spiritual practitioners have adopted Indigenous rituals. A wellknown case involves the sweat lodge retreats of James Arthur Ray. In 2009 three people died during one of his adopted sweat lodge ceremonies in Sedona Arizona. This prompted the elders of Native American tribes to speak out against this practice because these plastic shamans have not been properly trained. Covering the lodge with plastic tarps was just one of Ray s mistakes and he was later sued for impersonation. Similarly in Australia a period occurred when it was common for Aboriginal art to be copied by nonAboriginal artists often marketed and sold as authentic. This led to a renewed movement to authenticate Aboriginal products. Buddhist tattoos Musliminspired headdresses as fashion and White gay men adopting the dialect of Black women are other examples of cultural appropriation. The examples are nearly endless and context is often key. For example was the tattoo done in reverence or because it s cool? Would a Muslim man wearing the keffiyeh be considered a terrorist for that simple fact? At the same time if a White man wears it is it a fashion statement? Cultural appropriation remains a concern for a variety of reasons. For one this sort of borrowing is exploitative because it robs oppressed groups of the credit they deserve and often the capital owed to them as well. Many of the pioneers of rock music died penniless while the White musicians who ripped them off earned millions. Ultimately art and music forms that originated with oppressed groups come to be associated with members of the dominant group. As a result the dominant group is deemed innovative and edgy while the disadvantaged groups they borrow from face negative stereotypes implying they re lacking in intelligence and creativity. When singer Katy Perry performed as a geisha at the American Music Awards in 2013 she described it as an homage to the Asian culture. Asian Americans disagreed with this assessment declaring her performance yellowface. They also objected to the song choice Unconditionally for reinforcing the stereotype that Asian women are passive. The question of whether this form of borrowing is an homage or an insult lies at the core of cultural appropriation. What one person perceives as a tribute others may perceive as disrespectful. It s a fine line and one that must be carefully considered. Every individual can make the decision to show sensitivity toward others. On occasion someone may not be able to recognize a harmful appropriation unless its pointed out. This is why its important to recognize why youre buying or doing something associated with another culture. To behave responsibly and sensitively toward other groups ask yourself a series of questions The sharing of ideas traditions and material items is what makes life interesting and helps diversify the world. A genuine interest in other cultures is not necessarily wrong but cultural appropriation raises questions that should not be ignored.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PoliticalDiscussion/comments/6jxbp7/is_it_possible_that_cultural_appropriation_will/,  Cultural appropriation is a term that is used to describe when somebody uses cultural elements that originated from marginalized group of people that they are not apart of. Cultural appropriation has gotten widespread criticism within the past several years. The people who speak out against cultural appropriation often give several reasons why they are against it including but not limited too the fact that many marginalized cultures end up getting used and misused outside of their original context such as certain forms of clothing and accessories that have sacred meanings that are erased when people outside of that culture use them because they think they are interesting without understandingknowing where they came from or what they mean the fact that many marginalized people were often shamed and abused and oppressed for practicing their own culture and forced to assimilate while people outside of their culture began using such elements and ended up being praised for adopting such cultural elements and being labeled as trendy or Innovative or stylish the fact that many cultural elements end up being adopted and used by corporations for financial profit without giving credit to the source or compensating them.   Cultural assimilation is a term that is used describe when somebody adopts elements of the dominant culture or assimilate into the dominant culture. This term is contrasted to cultural appropriation. An example of cultural assimilation would be black women straightening their hair seeing as how natural hair on women of African descent is often viewed as being ugly by the dominant culture. Cultural assimilation often happens because marginalized people often don t face acceptance for how they are originally and they assimilate in order to make life easier for themselves.   Cultural exchange is the term used where people try to share cultures in a manner that is mutually beneficial for everybody involved. The term of cultural exchange is often used in contrast to cultural appropriation to define instances where a member of a marginalized culture invite someone from outside of the culture to partake in something. An example could be wearing traditional Indian clothing when one gets invited to a traditional wedding in India.   Now in the past several years numerous celebrities and fashion magazines and clothing retailers have faced accusations of cultural appropriation.   Recently groups of indigenous people from around the world called on the United Nations to do something about the issue of cultural appropriation specifically when companies and corporations adopt indigenous cultural elements without permission from such groups and do it for financial profit. The UN s World Intellectual Property Organisation WIPO has begun work on potentially making cultural appropriation illegal under international law. Would it ever happen? Would it be possible to clearly define whether or not something is cultural appropriation? Would any countries agree to change their laws to conform to the UN s directives?
