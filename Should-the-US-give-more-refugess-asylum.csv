https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/06/28/why-do-us-mayors-want-more-refugees/, Meanwhile some mayors want more refugees seeing them as crucial to their growth and prosperity. Research confirms that refugees contribute significantly to the communities where they settle. So should refugees be a higher priority? Many Americans conflate refugees with asylum seekers. Refugees are people who belong to a group that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR or a national government recognizes as fleeing war and persecution as established by the 1951 United Nations Refugee Convention. While the United States has a long history accepting refugees the formal federal program the U.S. Refugee Admission Program USRAP was established as part of the Refugee Act of 1980. Refugees go through an initial screening process by the UNHCR and are then referred to the U.S. State Department. The selected individuals go through several security screenings by agencies that are part of the Department of Homeland Security DHS. They come from all over the world including Africa Asia and Europe. Asylum seekers are different. They show up at the border claiming that they too are entitled to protection from violence and persecution in their home country. Their claims however must be reviewed by a court to determine whether they meet the government s standards. Furthermore asylum seekers may be detained while awaiting trial. The migrant surge at the U.S. southern border is actually a predictable pattern. So why have some U.S. mayors been asking for more refugees? Cities provide significant public assistance to integrate refugees into the local economy and culture. They do so despite stretched city budgets particularly in the Rust Belt where depopulation has meant less tax revenue. And yet even when the Obama administration raised the cap on refugees to its peak of 100000 18 mayors requested still more refugees. Additionally when the Trump administration slashed the number refugees allowed to enter to 18000 in 2020 88 mayors coming from both parties sent a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging the return to previous annual levels of refugee admissions. The answer Refugees economic contributions far outweigh the initial costs of resettlement as numerous studies have found. One such study commissioned by the city of Cleveland found that while in 2012 the city spent about 4.8 million on support for refugee resettlement the refugees who d settled there in the previous 12 years had contributed 48 million to the city s economy. A similar study in Detroit found that refugees who had settled there between 2007 and 2016 contributed from 229.6 million to 295.3 million to the local economy creating between 1798 and 2311 new jobs in 2016. In 2004 economist Kalena E. Cortes found that refugees work four percent more hours earn 20 percent more in income and develop their English language skills 11 percent faster than economic immigrants.  Refugees earn higher incomes than other immigrants which means that their tax contributions are higher too. One study found that over 20 years a refugee pays more in taxes than the cost of all the aid and public services they received. Refugees household spending on goods and services results in additional jobs and higher business revenue. Moreover refugee communities have a high rate of entrepreneurialism. A 2017 report found that the percentage of refugees who operate their own businesses is greater than that of other immigrants or nativeborn citizens. Want to know more? Check out TMC s Immigration Topic Guide offering scores of readable researchbased analysis of immigration. Refugees also make unquantifiable contributions in areas that have been losing population for decades. In areas like Pittsburgh St. Louis and Detroit abandoned homes and businesses have attracted squatters gangs and other criminal activities. Those abandoned buildings drain public budgets. In 2007 Buffalo s mayoral office estimated each abandoned house costs the city an average of 20060 over five years in lost taxes debris removal inspections and policing.  Refugees build communities in these areas that revitalize entire neighborhoods and drive out gangs and other kinds of crime. A Niskanen Center report quoted the director of a Buffalo refugee resettlement agency as saying that refugees were pretty much the only group that was moving into the west side of Buffalo and taking over those vacant houses and vacant businesses. That increases property values and expands the tax base. Because refugees also bring the promise of population growth cities compete to attract them. For example Buffalo boasts four refugee resettlement agencies and has been actively working with refugees since 1918. Two of these agencies began offering services in the 1980s as a response to the official U.S. refugee program. Buffalo s city officials hoped to see a population increase from the 2020 census which would be the first in decades because 12196 people from other countries moved to Erie County N.Y. between 2010 and 2014 more than half of them refugees. The Trump administration s nearfreeze on refugee resettlement may have undermined this goal. Why Biden s plan to slow migration through international aid is unlikely to succeed Even at the U.S. peak of taking in 100000 refugees they made up a small proportion of the 1 million immigrants that the United States admits each year. But this small group can transform and revitalize cities drained by decades of declining populations. No wonder mayors want more of them. Don t miss any of TMC s smart analysis!

Get the facts on the refugee cap.  The United States has long offered safe haven to people fleeing violence tyranny and persecution. After four years of recordlow arrivals under the Trump Administration President Joe Biden has an opportunity to rebuild America s bipartisan tradition of welcoming refugees. This is not just a lifesaving humanitarian imperative at a time when more people worldwide are uprooted by war and crisis than ever before. Refugee resettlement also enriches our economy and enhances our national security. Here s what you need to know. The president consults with Congress and sets an annual target for refugee admissions. By law this ceiling shall be justified by humanitarian concern or otherwise in national interest. The setting of the refugee admissions ceiling by the president is called the Presidential Determination or PD for short and is issued before the new fiscal year FY begins on Oct. 1. This system was established by the 1980 Refugee Act. Prior to the Trump Administration the average annual ceiling exceeded 95000. Presidents of both parties have set even higher ceilings President Ronald Reagan s highest ceiling was 140000 and President Barack Obama set a refugee admissions target of 110000 for 2017. While President Donald Trump was still in office his administration set the PD for fiscal year 2021 to just 15000 the lowest number since the creation of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program in 1980. It marked the fourth year in a row that the administration set the cap on refugee resettlement at a historic low. Luckily President Biden signed an Emergency Revised Presidential Determination to raise the FY 2021 goal to 62500.  To view this video please enable JavaScript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video  The president s decision comes after he removed discriminatory admissions categories set by the previous administrations targeting people from Africa and the Middle East. It also comes after Americans across the country called on the administration to restore America s legacy of welcome. While the Trump Administration s recordlow admissions goal remained in place families were separated and thousands were left waiting in limbo.  President Biden s decision is good for America and good for refugees said IRC president and CEO David Miliband. Traditionally the U.S. admissions ceiling has been set commensurate with global humanitarian need and U.S. strategic interests. All around the world people are fleeing wartorn countries at record levels. In 2019 an average of 24000 people had to flee their homes each day. A full one percent of all of humanity is forcibly displaced. Some 26 million of these individuals are refugees meaning they have had to cross an international border in their quest for safety. There s no end in sight to the refugee crisis as conflicts in SyriaIraqAfghanistanYemenSouth SudanSomalia and northeast Nigeria continue to deteriorate. Violence and instability in Venezuela as well as gang violence in Honduras El Salvador and Guatemala have also put millions in danger. Only those refugees most at risk just one percent of the total have a chance to resettle in the U.S. or another welcoming country. Most are fleeing religious persecution political oppression or terror. Many are widows orphans or victims of rape or torture. Some are in danger because they worked alongside American troops in their countries. Others are persecuted based on their ethnic group gender identity or sexual orientation. Presidents from both parties have ensured that America leads in times of crisis. Theyve supported refugees who seek liberty and have rejected ideologies opposed to American values.  These presidents recognized that refugee resettlement represents the best of the values America strives to uphold the right to equal treatment the commitment not to discriminate and the determination to uphold human dignity.  Both Republicans and Democrats have raised admissions for refugees fleeing communist uprisings religious persecution and tyranny in countries like Vietnam Cuba the former Soviet Union Kosovo Myanmar and Iran. Today the U.S. must provide unwavering welcome for people fleeing the worst protracted displacement crises of our day like those in Syria Somalia and Afghanistan. Refugee resettlement advances American strategic interests abroad Welcoming refugees helps U.S. allies that are hosting more than their fair share. Currently the world s poorest countries host the majority of the world s refugees 85 are hosted in middle and lowincome countries that are likely already impacted by acute food insecurity and malnutrition. If the U.S. refuses to show global leadership we risk other countries closing their borders shutting down refugee camps and forcing refugees to return. This would have catastrophic consequences for regional stability and security including the security of U.S. missions in those regions. But if the U.S. continues to lead on resettlement this encourages other countries to do more. The hardest way to come to the U.S. is as a refugee. Every refugee is hand selected for resettlement by the Department of Homeland Security and screened by U.S. security agencies in an exhaustive process. A reminder of how the U.S. refugee vetting resettlement process really works httpst.comjMd8XzCo2StandWithRefugeesRefugeesWelcomepic.twitter.comRBASDGxjUg See the vetting process in action. Hundreds of communities across the country welcome refugees with open arms. Thousands of volunteers from faith and community groups help refugees adapt to the American way of life. The number of Americans volunteering to assist refugees far exceeds the number of refugees actually arriving.  I don t think we can quantify the impact that refugee resettlement has had on Boise says Pastor Jenny Hirst of Boise Idaho. From businesses to innovative ideas that all makes us better people. And that s what we need to express loud and clear to those in our country it s not a taking away it s adding to who we are.  In addition hundreds of employers around the country work closely with resettlement agencies to hire refugees because they are reliable and hardworking. Refugees and their friends in the U.S. share how theyve changed each others lives. Refugees are entrepreneurs consumers and taxpayers contributing to economic growth and creating jobs. Entrepreneurship among refugees is nearly 50 percent higher than among people born in the U.S. During the COVID19 pandemic refugees have worked in the essential industries keeping our communities afloat. One in five of the refugees resettled in the U.S. by the International Rescue Committee in 2020 immediately took positions in healthcare or the food industry. The U.S. refugee resettlement program is designed to help refugees achieve selfsufficiency quickly. In 2019 85 percent of clients in an IRC employment program were economically selfsufficient within six months. And refugees pay on average 21000 more in taxes than they receive in government benefits.

The U.S. Refugee Admissions Program is a vital lifesaving program that protects refugees by helping them find safety in the United States. With more than 26 million refugees worldwide a strong U.S. refugee resettlement program is necessary.  But sadly despite the largest global displacement crisis in recorded history the administration has drastically lowered the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. over the past few years. In 2020 the admissions cap officially known as the Presidential Determination or PD was set at 18000 the lowest since the U.S. refugee resettlement program was created. A temporary halt to the resettlement program because of travel restrictions under COVID19 makes it unlikely that even 10000 refugees will be resettled in our country this year.  The U.S. should be setting an example to the world and showing everyone just how important it is to bring refugees to safety said Mark Hetfield the president and CEO of HIAS. We urge the administration to set a refugee ceiling high enough to inspire other countries to join in welcoming refugees.  From 1980 through 2017 the average annual PD was 95000 but since 2018 the numbers have been slashed each year and the effects are farreaching. It is possible that the administration could set the cap at yet another historic low or not even go through the PD process. Not setting a Presidential Determination for 2021 would be a shameful abdication of our nation s historic leadership in this area. The process for the Presidential Determination was established nearly four decades ago when Congress passed the Refugee Act of 1980 with strong bipartisan support. The legislation which codified America s commitment to protecting refugees states that the president must consult with Congress each year to determine the maximum number of refugees that can be resettled to the U.S. the following fiscal year the consultations for fiscal year 2021 have not yet taken place. Only a small percentage of the world s refugees are candidates for resettlement. Those with specific safety medical or other concerns that cannot be addressed in the countries to which they have fled find resettlement to a third country their only option. The administration has claimed many times that allowing in refugees is dangerous but refugees are among the most thoroughly vetted individuals allowed into the United States. In the face of the refugee crisis the PD represents the United States commitment and capacity to offer safe haven to refugees. Despite the administration s increasingly restrictive refugee and asylum policies HIAS is as dedicated as ever to helping refugees find welcome safety and freedom in the United States.

Afghan refugees walk through Dulles International Airport in Dulles Virginia on September 2 2021. Evelyn HocksteinReuters Written By Diana Roy Claire Klobucista and James McBride Updated Last updated March 26 2024 937 am EST Print Email Share Summary The State Department manages the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program or USRAP. Since it was created in 1980 more than three million refugees have been accepted into the country.President Donald Trump who saw the program as a security threat reduced the annual refugee ceiling to a record low of fifteen thousand in fiscal year 2021.As global humanitarian crises worsen President Joe Biden has taken steps to expand the refugee program but rebuilding its capacity has not been easy. IntroductionFor decades the United States was a world leader in refugee admissions. From taking in hundreds of thousands of Europeans displaced by World War II to welcoming those escaping from communist regimes in Europe and Asia during the Cold War the United States has helped define protections for refugees under international humanitarian law. Beginning in 1980 the U.S. government moved from an ad hoc approach to the permanent standardized system for identifying vetting and resettling prospective refugees that is still in use today. The size of the U.S. refugee program has often fluctuated. The war in Syria and the 2015 migration crisis in Europe increased policymakers scrutiny of arrivals from the Middle East beginning with the administration of President Barack Obama. President Donald Trump ratcheted up that scrutiny with a ban on refugees from certain countries and sharp cuts to overall refugee admissions sparking new debate over the national security implications of refugee policy. As conflict in places such as Afghanistan and Ukraine continue to displace millions of people President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild the U.S. refugee program including by creating a new Welcome Corps initiative that allows U.S. citizens to privately sponsor refugees.  Refugees and Displaced Persons   Immigration and Migration   United States   Donald Trump   Joe Biden  There are several different terms used to describe people who move from one place to another either voluntarily or under threat of force. With no universal legal definition migrant is an umbrella term for people who leave their homes and often cross international borders whether to seek economic opportunity or escape persecution. As defined by U.S. law and the United Nations 1951 Refugee Convention refugees are migrants seeking entry from a third country who are able to demonstrate that they have been persecuted or have reason to fear persecution on the basis of one of five protected grounds race religion nationality political opinion or membership in a particular social group. According to the UN refugee agency there were more than thirty million refugees worldwide as of mid2023 almost half of whom came from just three countries Syria Afghanistan and Ukraine in that order. Asylum seekers are those who meet the criteria for refugee status but apply from within the United States or at an official port of entry after arriving under a different status. Asylum seekers follow a different protocol than those applying for refugee status. But the country s official federal effort to resettle refugees known as the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program USRAP was not created until passage of the Refugee Act of 1980. Prior to 1980 legislation that authorized the acceptance of refugees was passed primarily on an ad hoc basis often responding to ongoing mass migrations. It was not until after the fall of South Vietnam to communist forces in 1975 when the United States began taking in hundreds of thousands of Southeast Asian refugees that Congress established a more standardized system.  Refugees and Displaced Persons   Immigration and Migration   United States   Donald Trump   Joe Biden  The 1980 legislation signed by President Jimmy Carter established permanent procedures for vetting admitting and resettling refugees into the country incorporated the official definition of the term refugee increased the number of refugees to be admitted annually to fifty thousand and granted the president authority to admit additional refugees in emergencies. Since that law was passed the United States has admitted more than three million refugees.  To view this video please enable JavaScript and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video  Annual numerical ceilings on refugee admissions are proposed by the president and require congressional approval. Following the 911 attacks President George W. Bush suspended refugee admissions for several months citing national security concerns. From 2001 to 2015 caps on refugee admissions stayed between seventy thousand and eighty thousand though both the Bush and Obama administrations regularly admitted fewer people than the ceilings allowed. In 2016 President Obama increased an earlier approved ceiling of eighty thousand to allow in an additional five thousand refugees as part of an effort to address a growing migration crisis caused by worsening conflict in Syria. As humanitarian crises elsewhere grew more dire including in Afghanistan and Iraq Obama proposed that the United States set a ceiling of 110000 refugee admissions for fiscal year 2017 FY2017. President Trump reversed Obama s proposed ceiling by capping the number of refugees allowed into the country in FY2017 at fifty thousand. He lowered this ceiling further to fortyfive thousand for 2018 then thirty thousand for 2019 and eighteen thousand for 2020. His administration argued that the reduction was necessary to direct more government resources to the backlog of applications from nearly eight hundred thousand asylum seekers who had reached the southern U.S. border. Despite critics countering that the asylum and refugee programs have little bearing on one another Trump set an even lower ceiling of fifteen thousand for FY2021 by far the lowest cap since the program s start. President Biden has promised to reverse this downward trend. In May 2021 he revised Trump s annual admissions cap to 62500 for the remainder of the year and in October he doubled the ceiling for FY 2022 to 125000. Biden maintained the 125000 cap for FY 2023 and FY 2024 with the majority of 2024 admission slots allocated for refugees from Africa and Latin America and the Caribbean. He has also launched the Welcome Corps program which allows U.S. citizens and permanent residents to privately sponsor and support refugees with the help of a consortium of nonprofit organizations. In the program s first year some fifteen thousand sponsors signed up to eventually welcome more than seven thousand refugees into the United States. Even so Trumpera reductions have been difficult to reverse. The United States accepted fewer than sixtyone thousand refugees in 2023 higher than previous years but far below the cap set by the Biden administration. Some advocacy groups argue that the annual cap should be increased to proportionately reflect the number of refugees worldwide which continues to increase while immigration policy experts have said that even the current admissions goal will be tough to reach given slow processing times and the ongoing effects of the COVID19 pandemic. The United States has consistently received refugees from Asia Africa Europe and Latin America though the total number of admissions has changed dramatically for some regions in the time since the U.S. refugee resettlement program was created. Immediately following passage of the 1980 act more than two hundred thousand refugees the highest total in recent history were admitted to the country the vast majority originated in Southeast Asian countries including Cambodia and Vietnam. Refugees admitted to the United States from former Soviet countries increased sharply in the decade beginning in 1989. From 2010 to 2020 the highest number of refugees came from Myanmar Iraq and Bhutan in descending order. By comparison in 2023 the countries with the most refugees admitted to the United States were the Democratic Republic of Congo Syria Afghanistan and Myanmar in that order. In 2017 Trump issued an executive order that temporarily prohibited the entry of nationals of seven Muslimmajority countries Iran Iraq Libya Somalia Sudan Syria and Yemen and indefinitely barred all Syrian refugees. Admissions for Syrians restarted in January 2018. The executive order also tightened visa restrictions that had been imposed under Obama on those seven countries. The Trump administration revised the order twice amid legal challenges until April 2018 when the Supreme Court allowed the third version of the order to stand. Trump also heavily criticized a resettlement deal with Australia finalized by Obama in which the United States was to take 1250 refugees currently being held by Australian authorities in offshore detention centers. Many of these refugees were from Iran and Somalia countries included in the third iteration of the travel ban. By January 2024 the United States had resettled more than 1100 refugees as part of the deal. The U.S. State Department in consultation with a constellation of other agencies and organizations manages the process through its refugee admission program USRAP. The first step for a potential refugee abroad is most often to register with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR. UNHCR officials collect documentation and perform an initial screening and then refer qualifying individuals to State Department Resettlement Support Centers RSCs of which there are seven around the world. Sometimes this referral is done by a U.S. embassy or a nongovernmental organization. Then RSC officials interview the applicants verify their personal data and submit their information for background checks by a suite of U.S. national security agencies. These security checks PDF include multiple forms of biometric screening such as crosschecks of global fingerprint databases and medical tests. If none of these inquiries produce problematic results including criminal histories past immigration violations connections to terrorist groups or communicable diseases the applicant can be cleared for entry to the United States. The entire admissions process generally takes between eighteen months and two years to complete. The three primary federal government agencies involved in the refugee resettlement process are the State Department the Department of Homeland Security DHS and the Department of Health and Human Services HHS. The State Department s Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration PRM is the first U.S. government point of contact it coordinates the process with all other agencies until a refugee is resettled. Through its Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS branch DHS is the principal agency responsible for vetting refugee applicants USCIS makes the final determination on whether to approve resettlement applications. Its security review uses the resources and databases of several other national security agencies including the National Counterterrorism Center FBI Department of Defense and multiple U.S. intelligence agencies. Several intergovernmental organizations play a crucial role at various points. The United Nations is primarily responsible for referring qualified applicants to U.S. authorities while the International Organization for Migration coordinates refugees travel to the United States. Today refugees are resettled in fortynine U.S. states though there are several states that generally resettle higher numbers than others. According to the U.S. State Department California Texas New York Pennsylvania and Washington have taken in the highest number of refugees as of February 2024 making up approximately 31 percent PDF of all refugee admissions admitted in FY 2024 to date. In the decade between 2010 and 2020 onethird of all 601000 resettled refugees went to just five states. The logistics of refugee resettlement are largely handled by ten domestic resettlement agencies many of them faithbased organizations such as the Church World Service and the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops. Representatives of these organizations meet and review the biographical data of the refugees selected by the State Department s Refugee Support Centers abroad to determine where they should be resettled. As part of this process federal law requires that resettlement agencies consult with local authorities PDF including law enforcement emergency services and public schools. While this consultation is required the 1980 Refugee Act gives the federal government final authority over whether to admit refugees and where they should be resettled. In the wake of the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris which were carried out by EU citizens who may have returned to Europe from the Middle East via refugee flows more than thirty U.S. governors protested the resettlement of any Syrian refugees in their states. Legal experts say that while states cannot directly block federal government decisions on where to place refugees they can complicate the process by directing state agencies to refuse to cooperate with resettlement agencies as the governors of Texas and Michigan did in 2015. Out of the more than three million refugees accepted by the United States over the past four decades a handful have been implicated in terrorist plots. According to a 2019 study by the libertarianleaning CATO Institute of the 192 foreignborn terrorists who committed attacks in the United States between 1975 and 2017 25 were refugees. Of these attacks only three proved deadly and all three took place before 1980 when the Refugee Act created the current screening procedures. Many of the perpetrators responsible for recent attacks have been U.S. citizens including the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooter one of the perpetrators of the 2015 San Bernardino attacks and the 2009 Fort Hood shooter. The 911 hijackers were in the country on tourist or business visas. Others were the children of asylees including the 2016 Manhattan bomber whose father had been an Afghan refugee and the Tsarnaev brothers who carried out the Boston Marathon bombing and whose parents fled wartorn Chechnya. Trump administration officials often voiced concerns over the vetting process for incoming refugees. But Biden and other critics condemned Trump s rhetoric as scaremongering and Biden has worked to restore U.S. leadership on global refugee resettlement. In February 2021 as part of his administration s plan to rebuild and enhance the country s refugee program he pledged to improve USRAP vetting to make it more efficient meaningful and fair.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2022/05/26/refugees-make-america-better-off/, Those restricting the entry of refugees and asylum seekers are wrong to argue humanitarian admissions make America poorer. New research shows refugees and asylum seekers make the United States better off. Background The Trump administration including the president and his chief immigration advisor Stephen Miller argued admitting refugees was bad for America. Donald Trump may have been the only president in U.S. history to deliver speeches vilifying refugees. Past presidents regularly extolled America s role as a place of safety for those persecuted abroad. Cliff Sims a Trump communication aide said Stephen Miller told him I would be happy if not a single refugee foot ever again touched American soil.  As Michael Clemens an economist at the Center for Global Development discusses in an important paper Trump and Miller translated their beliefs on refugees into the largest reduction in refugees in U.S. history and the negative consequences to America will be longlasting. Clemens calculates an 86 decline in refugee arrivals between FY 2016 and FY 2020 due to Trump administration policies. Clemens is on the mark a National Foundation for American Policy NFAP analysis found if between FY 2017 and FY 2021 annual refugee arrivals had remained at the FY 2016 level of 85000 nearly 300000 more refugees would have arrived in the United States during those five years. Clemens notes the number of asylum seekers those who apply for protection inside the United States also experienced a significant decline during the Trump administration. He identified a 68 drop in affirmative asylum applications between March 2017 and September 2019. The administration also restricted the likelihood of approval for individuals who applied for asylum as a defense against deportation. Cutting Refugee Admissions Harms Americans Clemens found restricting the number of refugees and asylum seekers harmed the U.S. economy and government finances. Beyond claiming a need for protection refugees and asylum seekers are economic actors writes Clemens. All are consumers most are or become workers and many are or become investors. All incur fiscal costs by using public services directly or indirectly and all generate fiscal revenue either directly or indirectly.  A policy of reducing their numbers must have economic ripple effects. Estimating such effects is different from assessing the overall merit of the policy given its many noneconomic effects. A policy causing large reductions in immigration in general creates large negative effects on the overall economy and on the fiscal balance of government. There is no meaningful controversy in the economic literature about this general qualitative conclusion.  What Did Clemens Find? Today there are roughly 295000 refugees missing from the U.S. population due to the 86 reduction in refugee resettlement starting in 2017 those who would be present now if refugee admissions during 2017 2021 had stayed at their 2016 levels according to Clemens. These missing refugees cost the overall U.S. economy over 9.1 billion each year 30962 per missing refugee per year on average and cost public coffers at all levels of government over 2.0 billion each year 6844 per missing refugee per year on average.  These costs would continue permanently even if refugee inflows this year returned to their 2016 levels because that would not replace the number missing from the population due to earlier reduced inflows. Put differently relative to 2019 levels a 10 percent reduction in refugee resettlement to the United States likely causes a loss to the American economy of more than 1.4 billion and a loss to public coffers federal state and local of more than 310 million cumulatively over the subsequent five years.  Turning to asylum seekers A 10 percent reduction in affirmative and defensive asylum seekers likely causes a loss to the American economy of more than 8.9 billion and a loss to public coffers of more than 1.5 billion cumulatively over the subsequent five years. Emphasis added. During the Trump administration the Department of Health and Human Services HSS completed a study that concluded Overall this report estimated that the net fiscal impact of refugees was positive over the 10year period at 63 billion. However the New York Times reported that White House immigration adviser Stephen Miller intervened to block the release of the positive findings although they were leaked to the media. Clemens points out the HHS report and others that use the accounting approach understate the positive fiscal effects of refugees because they fail to account for any of the effects of refugees on the rest of the economy. He notes that hiring migrant workers raises the value of firms future stream of capital income but using the accounting approach only considers taxes paid directly by refugees. Are There Other Ways The Positive Impacts of Refugees Are Understated? Nearly all studies on refugees may understate the positive impact of refugees due to limitations in the data. For example it is difficult to include the impact of refugees who make significant individual contributions to the U.S. economy. Andy Grove came to America after the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and went on to cofound and then lead the Intel Corporation which helped propel America s tech economy and create jobs tax revenue and shareholder wealth. Another refugee Sergey Brin cofounded Google a company that also has contributed to the U.S. economy. Google Alphabet has more than 150000 employees and is valued today at over 1.4 trillion. Al Goldstein entered America as a refugee and has founded two companies Avant and Amount that are valued at over 1 billion each and employ more 1000 people combined. The Fiscal Economic And Security Arguments The research by Michael Clemens shows claims that refugees will harm the U.S. economy or taxpayers are untrue. The security argument against refugees is also inaccurate.  It is in America s national security foreign policy and economic interests to welcome refugees and it can be done without harming national security according to Elizabeth Neumann former assistant secretary for counterterrorism and threat prevention at the Department of Homeland Security in an NFAP report. Over the last two decades security and law enforcement professionals at all levels have worked to establish improve and utilize robust security and vetting procedures for individuals admitted as refugees to the United States. These policies and procedures have been reviewed enhanced and strengthened repeatedly.  At a recent Mercatus Center event organized by Shikha Dalmia editor of The UnPopulist Michael Clemens said Economically an immigration restriction is a government ban on a wide variety of economic activities by natives. I just want to repeat that An immigration restriction is a wideranging government ban on economic activities by natives of the country of migrant destination. This is something that s not often appreciated . . . it s just a fact about how the economy works.  Over the decades the United States has admitted refugees because it serves humanitarian and foreign policy objectives. Some oppose such admissions by arguing refugees would harm the U.S. economy or taxpayer finances. The research from Michael Clemens shows admitting refugees is consistent with the traditions of America s founding and helps the country s economy.
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/09/19/most-americans-express-support-for-taking-in-refugees-but-opinions-vary-by-party-and-other-factors/, Against this backdrop around seveninten Americans 72 say taking in civilian refugees from countries where people are trying to escape violence and war should be a very or somewhat important goal for immigration policy in the United States. But only 28 say this should be a very important priority according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted last month. And opinions on this question vary by party race and ethnicity and other factors. The survey did not define refugee for respondents and the term can have specific legal meaning in certain contexts. For instance while the United Nations has an official refugee program some immigrants are granted asylum in the U.S. or receive protection from deportation under the Temporary Protected Status or TPS program. The U.S. recently made immigrants from Afghanistan and Ukraine eligible for TPS. This Pew Research Center analysis examines Americans views on the U.S. taking in civilian refugees trying to escape violence and war. The analysis relies primarily on a survey of 7647 U.S. adults conducted from Aug. 114 2022. The survey was conducted on the Center s nationally representative American Trends Panel with an oversample of Hispanic adults from Ipsos KnowledgePanel. White Black and Asian adults include those who report being only one race and are not Hispanic. Hispanics are of any race. Respondents on both panels are recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here is the question used in this analysis along with responses and its methodology. About fourinten Democrats and independents who lean toward the Democratic Party 41 say taking in refugees should be a very important policy goal but just 13 of Republicans and GOP leaners agree. Partisan differences on this question generally are larger than demographic differences. But women are somewhat more likely than men to say that taking in refugees who are trying to escape violence should be a very important goal for the U.S. 32 vs. 24. And Hispanic adults 38 just under half of whom are immigrants themselves are more likely than White 25 Black 30 or Asian Americans 26 to voice this opinion. It is worth noting that Asian adults in the U.S. are even more likely than Hispanic adults to be immigrants 71 vs. 45.  Indeed Hispanics who were born outside the U.S. are more likely than U.S.born Hispanics to say taking in civilian refugees should be a key U.S. policy goal 44 vs. 33. Similarly those who say their Hispanic identity is extremely or very important to how they think about themselves are much more likely to say this should be a very important policy goal than those who say their Hispanic identity is less important to them 45 vs. 27. Differences by education and income on this question are modest although Americans whose household income is under 30000 per year are somewhat more likely than others to say taking in refugees should be a very important goal for U.S. immigration policy. Many religious leaders including Pope Francis have long advocated for compassion for migrants and refugees with some Christians citing biblical teachings on the topic. But some Christian subgroups are more likely than others to say the U.S. should prioritize welcoming refugees. For instance Hispanic evangelicals Black Protestants and White nonevangelical Protestants all are more likely than White evangelical Protestants to say accepting refugees should be very important. This at least partly reflects the partisan composition of these religious groups with White evangelicals much more likely to identify as Republicans than as Democrats. Among U.S. Catholics there also are differences by race and ethnicity Hispanic Catholics are nearly twice as likely as White Catholics to say taking in refugees should be a very important policy goal for the U.S. 39 vs. 22. This analysis does not look separately at members of nonChristian religions due to sample size limitations. How Americans view accepting refugees from Afghanistan Ukraine In other recent surveys the Center asked Americans about their views on accepting refugees from two countries Afghanistan and Ukraine. In a September 2021 survey conducted shortly after the U.S. military s withdrawal from Afghanistan and the Taliban s subsequent takeover of the country 56 of U.S. adults said they strongly or somewhat favored the U.S. admitting thousands of refugees from Afghanistan while 42 strongly or somewhat opposed the idea. There was greater public support in the U.S. for accepting refugees from Ukraine according to a separate survey conducted in March 2022 just after the Russian invasion of Ukraine and the refugee crisis it created began. In that survey 69 of U.S. adults said they strongly or somewhat favored admitting thousands of Ukrainian refugees into the U.S. while 29 opposed the idea. In both surveys Democrats were considerably more likely than Republicans to express support for the U.S. taking in thousands of refugees from each conflict zone.

Not only are refugees not a burden rather they are welfareenhancing assets. Indeed accepting protecting and empowering refugees is a winwinwin formula for the refugees themselves for the country of destination and for the country of origin. It is a win for the refugees for obvious reasons The earlier a state commits to protecting refugees the earlier they can move forward with their lives without uncertainty blocking the way. Most importantly accepting them protects the most precious right of all The right to live. Turning our backs to refugees in many cases could be fatal for them. Thus accepting refugees providing the most basic protection is in many cases lifesaving. Accepting refugees is also a win for the receiving country and the communities that host them. By providing them with the right to work to health and to education refugees can start productive lives in their host countries. The faster they can integrate into the labor force the faster they can become productive members of society. Are you worried about all the job opportunities natives could lose to a refugee? Don t be. Most migration economists agree that the presence of more foreigners in the labor force doesn t hurt natives mainly because natives and foreigners typically have a different set of skills and compete for different types of jobs a fact recently corroborated using data on refugees resettled in the U.S. Moreover native workers often do better in the presence of more migrants in the labor force because in response to more competition natives usually specialize in betterpaid jobs that migrants cannot always compete in for instance jobs that require perfect domain of the local language. Finally we know that migrants engage in entrepreneurship at much higher rates than natives. In the U.S. for example while migrants are 15 percent of the population they represent 25 percent of entrepreneurs. If you think about it this should not really come as a surprise. The act of migrating and even fleeing to further away countries in the case of refugees is associated with risktaking behavior. Thus migrants are more likely to take risks also in the business sphere such as creating a new venture. By creating new businesses migrants also create new jobs for everyone. Small firms in turn are the engines of job growth. In the U.S. they create about 1.5 million jobs every year. Receiving countries can benefit in more ways too. Refugees could play a fundamental role in fostering international trade and investment. Since they know the business environment quite well they can mediate between business people in both countries who are willing to invest in the local community and trade with local businesses. Therefore these refugees can move the needle when it comes to integrating their communities in global markets in robust ways. What about origin countries? They can also benefit immensely in the medium to longterm from the resettlement of their citizens as refugees in foreign countries. First the countries of origin also benefit from the creation of business networks between them and the countries where the refugees were resettled. For developing countries overcoming conflict the flow of investment could be crucial for recovery. In addition to these business networks the refugees can play a significant role in transferring technologies and knowledge back home which translates into more competitive and diversified economies. In ongoing research with several coauthors we show how for instance the nations that emerged from the former Yugoslavia hugely benefited from the knowledge and experience gained by Bosnian Croat and Serb refugees who temporarily resettled in Germany during the war of the early 1990s. More generally even if a refugee is not a regular migrant refugees are forced to flee as opposed to many migrants who choose to do so the studies have shown that the economic benefits of migration also apply when focusing on refugees. This is because similarly to migrants and regardless of the reason that originated their move they still bring a different set of skills than natives which can be key to creating business networks and knowledge diffusion. Naturally as in any other change that affects the economy regulation reforms external shocks etc. integrating refugees into the labor force might result in some people being worseoff in the short term even when the aggregate gains are positive. But that speaks to the need for having proper safety nets in place and not to rejecting refugees. Overall if given the right protections and support refugees can be an asset not a burden for all countries involved. Therefore accepting and protecting refugees is not only morally right but also the smart thing to do.
