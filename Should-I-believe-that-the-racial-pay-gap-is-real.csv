https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/, Looking at gender race and ethnicity combined all groups with the exception of Asian men lag behind white men in terms of median hourly earnings according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. White men are often used in comparisons such as this because they are the largest demographic group in the workforce 33 in 2015. In 2015 average hourly wages for black and Hispanic men were 15 and 14 respectively compared with 21 for white men. Only the hourly earnings of Asian men 24 outpaced those of white men. Among women across all races and ethnicities hourly earnings lag behind those of white men and men in their own racial or ethnic group. But the hourly earnings of Asian and white women 18 and 17 respectively are higher than those of black and Hispanic women 13 and 12 respectively and also higher than those of black and Hispanic men. While the hourly earnings of white men continue to outpace those of women all groups of women have made progress in narrowing this wage gap since 1980 reflecting at least in part a significant increase in the education levels and workforce experience of women over time.  White and Asian women have narrowed the wage gap with white men to a much greater degree than black and Hispanic women. For example white women narrowed the wage gap in median hourly earnings by 22 cents from 1980 when they earned on average 60 cents for every dollar earned by a white man to 2015 when they earned 82 cents. By comparison black women only narrowed that gap by 9 cents from earning 56 cents for every dollar earned by a white man in 1980 to 65 cents today. Asian women followed roughly the trajectory of white women but earned a slightly higher 87 cents per dollar earned by a white man in 2015 whereas Hispanic women fared even worse than black women narrowing the gap by just 5 cents earning 58 cents on the dollar in 2015. Black and Hispanic men for their part have made no progress in narrowing the wage gap with white men since 1980 in part because there have been no improvements in the hourly earnings of white black or Hispanic men over this 35year period. As a result black men earned the same 73 share of white men s hourly earnings in 1980 as they did in 2015 and Hispanic men earned 69 of white men s earnings in 2015 compared with 71 in 1980. To be sure some of these wage gaps can be attributed to the fact that lower shares of blacks and Hispanics are college educated. U.S. workers with a fouryear college degree earn significantly more than those who have not completed college. Among adults ages 25 and older 23 of blacks and 15 of Hispanics have a bachelor s degree or more education compared with 36 of whites and 53 of Asians. However looking just at those with a bachelor s degree or more education wage gaps by gender race and ethnicity persist. Collegeeducated black and Hispanic men earn roughly 80 the hourly wages of white college educated men 25 and 26 vs. 32 respectively. White and Asian collegeeducated women also earn roughly 80 the hourly wages of white collegeeducated men 25 and 27 respectively. However black and Hispanic women with a college degree earn only about 70 the hourly wages of similarly educated white men 23 and 22 respectively. As with workers overall collegeeducated Asian men outearn collegeeducated white men by about 3 per hour of work. What contributes to these persistent wage gaps? Research shows that a majority of each of these gaps can be explained by differences in education labor force experience occupation or industry and other measurable factors. For example NBER researchers Francine Blau and Lawerence Kahn found that education and workforce experience accounted for 8 of the total gender wage gap in 2010 while industry and occupation explained 51 of the difference. When it comes to race sociologists Eric Grodsky and Devah Pager found that education and workforce experience accounted for 52 of the wage gap between black and white men working in the public sector in 1990 and that adding occupational differences explained approximately 20 of the wage gap. And NBER researcher Roland Fryer found that for one group of adults in their 40s controlling for standardizedtest scores reduced the wage gap between black men and white men in 2006 by roughly 70. The remaining gaps not explained by these concrete factors are often attributed at least in part to discrimination. Blau and Kahn point out however that there are both portions of this unmeasured difference that could be due to factors other than discrimination e.g. gender differences in behaviors like risk aversion or negotiation as well as portions of the measured difference that may in fact be due to discrimination e.g. a woman or minority not entering a highpaying STEM field because of experiences that may be rooted in prejudice such as greater encouragement for men than women to pursue these studies. When it comes to racial discrimination in the workplace most Americans 60 say blacks and whites are treated about equally but opinions on this vary considerably across racial and ethnic groups. A new Pew Research Center report finds that roughly twothirds 64 of blacks say black people in the U.S. are generally treated less fairly than whites in the workplace just 22 of whites and 38 of Hispanics agree. About twointen black adults 21 and 16 of Hispanics say that in the past year they have been treated unfairly in hiring pay or promotion because of their race or ethnicity just 4 of white adults say the same. And while 40 of blacks say their race or ethnicity has made it harder for them to succeed in life just 5 of whites and 20 of Hispanics say this. Some 31 of whites say their race or ethnicity has eased the way toward their success. At least sixinten whites 62 and Hispanics 65 and about half of blacks 51 say their race or ethnicity hasn t made much of a difference. For their part about a quarter of women 27 say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed in life compared with just 7 of men. About sixinten men and women say their gender hasn t made much difference but men are much more likely than women to say their gender has made it easier to succeed 30 vs. 8. In addition a 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that about oneinfive women 18 say they have faced gender discrimination at work including 12 who say they have earned less than a man doing the same job because of their gender. By comparison oneinten men say they have faced genderbased workplace discrimination including 3 who say their gender has been a factor in earning lower wages.

Employers can examine their pay policies to root out inequities As employers in the U.S. tackle issues around racism fresh attention is being given to the racial wage gap and why black men and women in particular still earn substantially less than their white counterparts. Nearly 56 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act we find equal pay for equal work is still not a reality noted Jackson Gruver a data analyst at compensation data and software firm PayScale. Last year PayScale analyzed differences in earnings between white men and men of color using data from a sample of 1.8 million employees surveyed between January 2017 and February 2019. Among the findings Gruver reported Even as black or AfricanAmerican men climb the corporate ladder they still make less than equally qualified white men. They are the only racialethnic group that does not achieve pay parity with white men at some level.  The study found that black men had the largest uncontrolled pay gap relative to white men when comparing the average earnings of black men and white men in the U.S. On average black men earned 87 cents for every dollar a white man earned. Hispanic workers had the next largest gap earning 91 cents for every dollar earned by white men. On the other side of the earnings spectrum Asian men typically earned 1.15 for every dollar earned by a white male worker.   Better news was found in the controlled pay gap a comparison of pay for black and white men with the same experience and education doing the same job in the same geographic location. This approach showed that black men earned 98 cents for every dollar earned by white men with the same qualifications. While that difference may seem small when a 2 percent difference in pay is compounded over the course of a career it adds up to black men taking home significantly less pay than their white male peers.    To put that in perspective the median salary of a white man in our sample is 72900 the controlled median pay for black or AfricanAmerican men is thus 71500 Gruver said. This suggests a 1400 difference in pay that is likely attributable to race.  Gruver attributed much of the racial pay gap to an opportunity gap and occupational segregation.  When we look at the opportunity gap we find men of color have higher rates of holding individual contributor jobs than white men he noted. The study found for instance that a larger percentage of black men 63 percent and Hispanic men 61 percent held individual contributor roles compared with 56 percent of white men who weren t in management. Even when they hold management positions black men are paid less than their white counterparts. Executivelevel black men earned 97 cents for every dollar white men with the same qualifications took home PayScale found. Even more concerning the racial wage gap widened as black men moved up the corporate ladder. This difference may be partly attributable to occupational segregation meaning that black men are more likely to work in industries that generally pay less such as social services in comparison with white men in senior positions Gruver said.  Comparing what women of color are paid to what white nonHispanic men make demonstrates the enormous economic impact of the double burden of sexism and racism wrote Brandie Temple a publicpolicy fellow at the nonprofit National Women s Law Center NWLC and Jasmine Tucker director of research at the organization in an online post. NWLC calculations based on the U.S. Census Bureau s Current Population Survey for 2016 revealed that when comparing all men and women who work full time yearround in the U.S. women were paid just 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. But the wage gap was even larger when looking specifically at black women who work full time yearround they were paid only 63 cents for every dollar paid to white nonHispanic men.  This gap which amounts to a loss of 21001 a year means that black women have to work more than 19 months until the very last day of July to make as much as white nonHispanic men did in the previous 12month calendar year Temple and Tucker observed.  Black women who worked full time yearround in lowwage occupations were typically paid about 21700 annually compared to the 36000 typically paid to white nonHispanic men in these occupations NWLC found. This gap translates to a loss of 14300 each year to the wage gap more than enough to pay for an entire year s worth of rent or more than a year and a half of child care costs Temple and Tucker noted. Among workers in highwage occupations such as lawyers engineers and physicians black women who work full time yearround were typically paid about 70000 compared to the 110000 typically paid to white nonHispanic men in the same jobs. This amounts to an annual loss of 40000 each year or 1.6 million over a 40year career. SHRM membersonly toolkit Managing Pay Equity Even after completing undergraduate and graduate degrees black and Hispanic workers earned less than nonHispanic white workers with the same or often less education said Roy Eduardo Kokoyachuk a partner at ThinkNow Research which helps companies respond to the demographic and cultural drivers that influence consumer decisions. In a May 2020 column for the website Market Insider Kokoyachuk wrote that The numbers are sobering. I ran the Census Current Population Survey s 2018 median income levels by race and bachelor s degree attainment and found that black and Hispanic bachelor s degree holders earn nearly a quarter less than Asians and whites with equal levels of education.   While some undergraduate majors lead to higher wages and Asian students were more likely to major in science technology engineering and math STEM subjects for instance that doesn t explain why wage differences exist more broadly Kokoyachuk noted. Even among black and Hispanic workers who have earned professional degrees their incomes still don t break six figures. Whites and Asians however double their incomes by earning professional degrees allowing them to make well over 100000 a year Kokoyachuk said.    NWLC s analysis found that black women with a bachelor s degree were typically paid 46694 just under what white nonHispanic men with only a high school degree were paid 46729. Black women had to earn a master s degree to make slightly more 56072 than white nonHispanic men with just an associate degree 54620. Source NWLC calculations based on U.S. Census Bureau s Current Population Survey 2016 Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Although workers of all races on average earned higher wages in 2018 than in 2000 Kokoyachuk pointed out that at every level of wage distribution the gap between black and white wages was larger in 2018 than it was in 2000 the data showed. The racial wage gap can be overcome he said if policymakers are committed to taking actions such as  Performing pay audits.  Not asking applicants about their past earnings.  Salary history bans do work and are an important component in closing gender and racial pay gaps said Tanya Jansen cofounder of beqom a cloudbased compensation software provider.  Upgrading technology.  While instituting salary bans is progress in the right direction companies should also consider instituting datadriven technology to help automate the compensation decisionmaking process and eliminate unconscious biases from the start of the recruiting and hiring process Jansen said.  Update Beginning in August the U.S. Army will no longer include photos of soldiers on records used to select future officers to help eliminate unconscious biases in its promotionandadvancement process defense officials said on June 25. Because economic outcomes are heavily influenced by social networks Kokoyachuk also advised improving careermentoring programs for minority workers.  For younger workers at the start of their careers these efforts can include creating better opportunities for minority graduates to mingle with or be mentored or sponsored by decisionmakers from other groups he noted. Doing so can help them build up social connections that they can use when seeking higherpaying positions.

Centuries of discrimination and exploitation have left Black Americans much poorer than white Americans. The median white household has a net worth 10 times that of the median Black household. If Black households held a share of the national wealth in proportion to their share of the U.S. population it would amount to 12.68 trillion in household wealth rather than the actual sum of 2.54 trillion. The total racial wealth gap therefore is 10.14 trillion. There is a vital and vibrant conversation in America today about reparations programs and other expenditurebased approaches to close the racial wealth gap. These investments are a moral imperative and an urgent economic necessity. But any program to close to racial wealth gap must grapple with the reality of wealth concentration in contemporary America. The 400 richest American billionaires have more total wealth than all 10 million Black American households combined. Black households have about 3 of all household wealth while the 400 wealthiest billionaires have 3.5 of all household wealth in the United States. Because wealth in the United States is so highly concentrated and because the wealthiest Americans are almost exclusively white the racial wealth gap is also concentrated among the wealthiest families. Indeed if the wealth gap were completely eliminated for all but the richest 10 of households the total racial wealth gap would still be more than 8 trillion 80 of the total wealth gap that exists today.  The 400 richest American billionaires have more total wealth than all 10 million Black American households combined.  Any plan to eliminate the total racial wealth gap requires in addition to a transformative national investment in Black households and communities a program of heavy and highly progressive taxation aimed at the very wealthiest Americans. A comprehensive agenda to close the racial wealth gap would likely include reforms to income and estate taxation plus new taxes on wealth and inheritance buttressed by a substantial investment in enforcement. While these taxes would likely also raise substantial revenue this is not their primary purpose. High and progressive taxation of extreme wealth is in itself a strategy for racial justice because it would directly reduce the portion of the racial wealth gap that exists at the top of the economic ladder. This paper begins by describing the racial wealth gap its origins and some of the recent spending proposals to reduce or eliminate it. I then examine how the racial wealth gap interacts with wealth concentration in America and demonstrate the vital role that taxation must play in closing the racial disparity in wealth. Back to top  There is an enormous disparity between the wealth of Black and white Americans. According to the 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances the median white household has a net worth of 171000 10 times the net worth of the median Black household 17100. In other words Black households are overrepresented among the poor and working class and underrepresented among the uppermiddle class and the wealthy Figure 1. The poorest 20 of American households have a net worth of less than 4700 many of these households have a negative wealth due to debt. Of these households 26 identify as Black. The richest 20 of American households have a net worth of more than about 500000 3 of these households identify as Black.  Unfortunately policymakers have often put the responsibility for fixing centuries of racial inequity back on the shoulders of Black people. For decades elected officials argued that personal choices explained racial disparities. These claims have been thoroughly debunked. As economists Trevon Logan and Darrick Hamilton have demonstrated Greater educational attainment harder work better financial decisions and other changes in habits and practices on the part of blacks are wholly inadequate to bridge the racial chasm in wealth. Even when Black people have advanced degrees own their home have high paying jobs and engage in other behaviors associated with asset building their wealth is typically much lower than their white peers. Individuallevel factors are simply not the explanation for the difference in the economic fortunes of Black and white people. Instead the racial wealth gap should be recognized as the consequence of discrimination public and private throughout American history and continuing to this day. Nearly 250 years of slavery were followed by a century of Jim Crow segregation and economic exploitation reinforced by statesanctioned violence. Until the later 20th Century Black people were excluded from public programs to encourage homeownership and higher education. Racial inequality persists in our contemporary putatively colorblind system due to discrimination Black people receive lower valuations on their homes and earn less money compared to white people performing the same work. Biases in public investment and criminal justice leave Black communities simultaneously underserved and overpoliced and these civil rights violations also have serious economic consequences. Black people in America have been systematically stripped of the wealth they have produced. Only a transformative national agenda can address the racial wealth gap because the disparity is the product of societal racism compounded over generations. Back to top  It is impossible of course to design any policy agenda that would fully reverse the effects of centuries of racism. Justice this long delayed has meant justice denied to generations. But there is a crucial and vibrant conversation occurring today that envisions what reparations would look like. The most straightforward approach is for the federal government to provide money to descendants of American slaves. In their book From Here to Equality William A. Darity and A. Kirsten Mullen have proposed a detailed program that addresses eligibility total outlay payment mechanisms and oversight of a potential reparations policy. There are many other economic policies that are also commonly suggested to reduce the Blackwhite wealth gap. Rashawn Ray and Andre Perry outline some of those proposals in their essay Why We Need Reparations for Black America. In addition to direct payments to descendants of slaves Ray and Perry look to a variety of programs to fund college education forgive student loans and promote homeownership and entrepreneurship in the Black community. Darrick Hamilton and William Darity have proposed a system of baby bonds that would provide American children with a nestegg at birth targeting larger bonds to children of lowerincome families would substantially reduce the median racial wealth gap over a generation.  A spendingbased program of reparations is a moral imperative. It is also an urgent economic necessity.  A spendingbased program of reparations is a moral imperative. It is also an urgent economic necessity. A serious reparations investment would provide enormous economic stimulus to the economy as a whole and would infuse urgently needed funds in households and communities that have suffered from chronic underinvestment. But taxation and particularly heavy and progressive taxation of wealth also has a critical role to play in achieving racial equality. To understand why we must look at the relationship between the racial wealth gap and overall wealth concentration. It is a striking fact that the 400 richest American billionaires have more total wealth than all 10 million Black American households combined. Black households have about 3 of all household wealth while the 400 wealthiest billionaires have 3.5 of all household wealth Figure 2.1 This startling statistic illustrates two broader economic realities with immense policy implications for racial justice in America. First it suggests the scope of the total racial wealth gap not the median gap between typical households but the full disparity between the fraction of wealth held by Black people and their percentage of the U.S. population. Using data from the Federal Reserve s 2016 Survey of Consumer Finances2 if Black households held a share of the national wealth in proportion to their share of the U.S. population it would amount to 12.68 trillion in household wealth rather than the actual sum 2.54 trillion. The total racial wealth gap is over 10.14 trillion.3 Second the rough wealth parity between 400 billionaires and 10 million Black households also indicates the extreme and extremely racialized wealth concentration that exists in the contemporary United States. A small fraction of Americans holds most American wealth and they are almost exclusively white. So although white households are on average wealthier than Black households at every income level the vast majority of the total racial wealth gap in dollar terms is at the top.  At the top of the wealth spectrum there is a lot more money and a lot fewer Black people.  Figure 3 shows both of these phenomena in a single graph. The figure reports the proportion of total wealth held by Black and nonBlack households at each level of household wealth. The dark blue bars indicate the fraction of wealth held by Black families in each wealth quantile as noted above Black households have only a small fraction of national household wealth and this holds at every wealth level. At the same time the chart shows how highly wealth is concentrated. The richest 10 of American households hold more than threequarters of all U.S. household wealth.4 Finally the graph demonstrates the interplay between the racial wealth gap and wealth concentration. Among the richest 10 of households only 1.9 of these households are Black. In short At the top of the wealth spectrum there is a lot more money and a lot fewer Black people.  In fact the chart does not fully indicate how concentrated wealth is by both class and race. Half of the wealth held in the top 10 about twofifths of all American household wealth is held by the top 1 of households. Within the top 1 of households less than 1 identify as Black. Even the wealthiest Black households moreover are less wealthy than the wealthiest white households. According to the Forbes 2020 list the 571 white billionaires who make up 93 of all billionaires have about 2.8 trillion dollars in personal net worth. This is 96 of all billionaireheld wealth and more than 3 of the total household wealth of the United States. The five Black billionaires who make up 0.8 of all billionaires have 14 billion dollars less than 0.5 of all billionaireheld wealth. Were Black people represented among billionaires in accordance with their portion of the U.S. population there would be 80 Black billionaires and they would hold not 14 billion dollars but 383 billion dollars. In other words the racial wealth gap among billionaires is 369 billion dollars. The point is not that billionaires need more billions or that America needs more billionaires. On the contrary. The point is that closing the total racial wealth gap is exceptionally difficult without reducing the concentration of wealth among a small class of almost exclusively white people. Even equality of total wealth would not be real parity moreover if white people continued to be immensely overrepresented among the very rich whose economic and political power is both quantitatively and qualitatively different from that held by most Americans. The problem is clearly illustrated if we imagine the wealth gap between Black and white households were completely eliminated for all but the richest 10 of households. This would be an extraordinary achievement of public policy total wealth parity between all the Black and white households that have less than 1.2 million in net worth. Nonetheless because so much of American wealth is held by so few the total racial wealth gap would still be 8.3 trillion dollars more than 80 of the total wealth gap that exists today.5 Back to top  Most analyses of the racial wealth gap and most policy agendas to close the disparity focus on the median household. And for good reason The median captures the experience of the typical person for whom housing and education costs are major factors in wealth accumulation. But as the data above demonstrate closing the median racial disparity in wealth is not the whole task. Darity and Mullen use the total racial wealth gap as their measure of the contemporary economic disparity between Black and white Americans that has resulted from centuries of discrimination and exploitation. Taking into account the distribution of the total racial wealth gap it is clear that racial justice requires progressive taxation. A first step would be to reverse the slide toward regressivity that has characterized the American tax code in recent decades. Top marginal income tax rates have fallen from a peak of 92 in the early 1950s to 37 today.6 The income tax rewards wealth over work by taxing income from ownership at much lower rates than income from salaries and wages. State and local taxes moreover are generally regressive. In sum the tax code is only somewhat progressive for those between the poor and the uppermiddle class and tax rates actually go down for the very rich.  The tax code is only somewhat progressive for those between the poor and the uppermiddle class and tax rates actually go down for the very rich.  Additionally though nominally colorblind the U.S. tax code is not raceneutral in its effects. As political scientist Chris Faricy notes tax expenditures disproportionately help uppermiddleclass whites. Tax advantages for home ownership amount to a racial subsidy for white families while local property tax assessments are systematically biased against Black homeowners.7 Legal scholar Dorothy Brown notes that Black families are more likely to pay a marriage penalty.8 In addition there are taxprivileged workplace retirement plans which fewer Black people have access to and tax benefits for the elderly which fewer Black people receive due to shorter life expectancy. Lowincome people of color are also targeted for audits and states have come to increasingly rely on fees and fines which are extremely regressive and linked to discriminatory policing. In other words tax policies compound the discrimination and exploitation that Black people experience in hiring housing education health and other aspects of life. Reversing these policies and topheavy tax cuts like the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act would help ensure that the tax code does not exacerbate racial inequity. But to close the total racial wealth gap requires more than just the undoing of the tax code s most regressive and racially biased aspects. It demands taxation at levels high enough to reduce the extreme wealthhoarding that characterizes the contemporary American economy. Tax policies that would substantially reduce the total racial wealth gap must be highly progressive and very heavy. The first point is obvious progressive taxes hit those at the top of the economic spectrum where the bulk of the racial wealth gap resides. The second point that progressive taxes need to be high to be meaningful is also an obvious truth though more rarely acknowledged. Progressivity measures only the relative impact of a tax not its total effect. For example a tax of 1 on billionaires and 0 on everyone else is highly progressive but it is far too low to affect the distribution of wealth. There are an array of tax policies that could fit these basic criteria. Taxes on estates or inheritance are especially promising because intragenerational transfers account for fully half of total wealth in the United States as well as more of the racial wealth gap than any other demographic and socioeconomic indicators including education income and household structure. Higher top marginal tax rates on income while not exactly correlated with wealth reduce income inequality both pre and posttax. Both of these approaches are tried and true. As economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman explain the development of progressive income and estate taxation in the mid20th century made it difficult to accumulate and pass on large fortunes. When these policies were reversed in the late 20th century the economic elite found they could amass and transfer to their heirs a larger and larger share of wealth. Perhaps the most efficient route is the newly popular proposal of a tax directly on wealth. Legal scholar Beverly Moran has discussed the potential of a wealth tax in the context of a reparations program.9 Using data from Saez and Zucman on the distributional effects of the wealth tax plans we can estimate the potential impact of such a policy on the racial wealth gap. The most aggressive plan considered by Saez and Zucman proposed by Thomas Piketty in his 2019 book Capital and Ideology would impose a 90 marginal tax rate on billionaires which would in essence limit fortunes to 1 billion dollars.10 Though Piketty s proposed tax would touch barely 600 households it would immediately reduce racial wealth inequality by 294 billion. Applying a similar policy at a lower threshold 110 million in wealth would reach about 16000 households and would reduce racial wealth inequality by about a remarkable 500 billion. Note that this impact comes prior to any allocation of the revenue raised by these taxes which would amount to trillions of dollars. These revenues could also be allocated to reduce the racial wealth gap. But the tax alone results in an increase in racial equity of several hundred billion dollars simply by reducing the fortunes of the extremely wealthy who are disproportionately white. If such a narrowly targeted tax can have a measurable impact on the racial wealth gap a more comprehensive tax strategy to reduce wealth concentration could easily have even more substantial effects. Assessing the impact on the total racial wealth gap should become a standard practice in the analysis of tax proposals distributional effects. While technically complicated depending on the measure and given the lack of racespecific data gathered by the IRS such calculations provide vital information about the economic implications of tax proposals. What is already clear however is that heavy progressive taxation can and should reverse racial inequity at the economic levels left unaddressed by expenditurebased racial justice policies. Back to top  Because wealth in the United States is so highly concentrated and because the extremely wealthy are almost exclusively white people high and progressive taxation is a critical component of any plan to close the racial wealth gap. It is important to note that the racial justice effect of heavy progressive taxation precedes the spending of the resulting revenue and is in fact independent of the revenue raised. The direct economic effects of taxation are often underappreciated there is a tendency to focus on how the money raised will be spent. But taxes have their own economic impact separate from the use of revenue. Heavy progressive taxation directly reduces the racial disparity of wealth because it reduces the highly concentrated wealth that is held almost exclusively by white people. Of course public revenues can and should be used to advance racial equity. The tax proposals discussed here could raise immense amounts of revenue and the effect of progressive taxation on the racial wealth gap could easily be multiplied by devoting its revenues to programs that would increase economic equality. But the purpose of the proposal here is not to develop a revenue stream for racial justice investments particularly if the amount of revenue were to be misrepresented as a ceiling for the size of a such expenditures. High and progressive taxation of extreme wealth is in itself a strategy for racial justice a complement to spendingbased approaches and not a budget offset. It is worth considering why it is rare to see calculations of the racial justice effects of progressive taxation. Some of the reasons are technical there are many assumptions involved in assessing the impact of taxes on the wealth distribution. Moreover the tendency to use the median as the measure of the racial wealth gap while useful for capturing the typical experience disguises the implications of extreme wealth concentration.  The difference between Black wealth and white wealth in America is not only the result of exclusion it is the result of exploitation.  But there is I believe another reason taxation is sometimes sidelined in our consideration of race and the economy. It is common in policy circles to describe the racial wealth gap as the result of the exclusion of Black people from opportunity. And this is certainly accurate. But the difference between Black wealth and white wealth in America is not only the result of exclusion it is the result of exploitation. Fundamental to U.S. economy has always been the transmogrification of Black labor and talent into white wealth. We can in our longerstanding institutions sometimes track wealth s lineage directly to that exploitation universities that preserved themselves by selling human chattel newspapers that published enslavers advertisements states that profited from convict leasing banks that enriched themselves by defrauding Black homeowners. Each story is another entry in a centurieslong ledger that many people would prefer not to examine in its entirety. The case for reparations lays bare the reality that the distribution of American wealth is not an innocent consequence of individual fortune or effort. I am convinced that chattel slavery and apartheid like genocide are crimes of such magnitude that they place upon a nation an unassailable moral claim for restitution. But accepting that reparations are owed to Black America does not preclude other moral claims for economic reform and redistribution. And so it is profoundly uncomfortable for the holders of American property to consider its origins. We are in the words of William Blackstone so pleased with our right of property that we seem afraid to look back to the means by which it was acquired as if fearful of some defect in our title.  Squeamishness is no excuse for policy inaction. Today American wealth has consolidated in a very small number of hands hands that are almost exclusively white. Any agenda to close the racial wealth gap should include heavy taxation of extreme wealth. Back to top   v_williamson   The Forbes 400 were estimated to hold 3.5 of national household wealth in 2018.

https://www.reddit.com/r/AskFeminists/comments/1866p44/question_about_the_wage_gap_that_i_cant_think_of/,  The question is How come the ethnicity wage gap is never mentioned yet the sex wage gap is? I always thought the wage gap was faulty yes it exists but theres also reasons behind why maternity part time choice of jobs. But there was also a good case behind it women are expected to stay at home when a couple has a child women are scared of backlash for negotiation. So overall it made sense.   But then I remember that in the UK there is a massive wage gap between ethnicities. Chinese and Indians are obviously the highest paid workers while whites Bangladeshis and Pakistanis are paid the least. I ve never once heard someone mention this disparity in a negative light but how is this different to the wage gap between sexes? If anything this statistic seems impossible since both Indians and Chinese have to work twice as hard to get into the same unis as Africans Caribbeans yet they remain at the top.   This got me thinking how you even fix a wage gap issue in this case. Punish the Chinese and Indians who are raised in a hardworking environment hence their prosperity or increase the pay of the Pakistanis and such which to me seems like preference for certain races. The same goes for men and women. Decrease men or increase women? 
https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/10/6-ways-to-convince-a-skeptic-the-pay-gap-is-real.html, Extensive research demonstrates that the gender pay gap exists but there are many skeptics who still think otherwise. According to the Institute for Women s Policy and Research IWPR and the American University of American Women U.S. women working fulltime earned just 0.80 for every dollar earned by a man in 2016. At this rate of change women are expected to reach pay equity with men in 2059. The wage gap widens even more when broken down by race. Black women make 0.63 for every dollar while Latina women earn 0.54 cents. For women of color the timeline for pay equity is even longer the IWPR found that Latina women would have to wait until 2233 and black women until 2124. But even with statistics like these some deny that the gender pay gap exists or downplay its consequences. According to Ellevest an womanfocused online investing platform only 61 percent of men believe that men earn more than women for doing the same job. The other 39 percent of men either do not believe the gap is real or chose not to answer the survey question. But women view things differently 83 percent of women surveyed say they believe there is a gender wage gap. In honor of Equal Pay Day the annual date that symbolizes when women s earnings finally catch up to what men earned the year prior we ve compiled a list of the top six arguments against the gender pay gap and how to counter them. It s not that women want to leave their jobs to take care of their children it s that they re forced to. One problem is that a lot of men and women in the United States don t have paid family leave says Kevin Miller a senior researcher at the AAUW. Although women will take unpaid family leave men won t says Miller which is due in part to gender norms. Research has found that men in particular refuse to take family leave if it s not paid explains Miller. We expect women to take leadership in a way that we don t expect men.  One solution to this problem is to offer all employees paid family leave. However Miller notes that even when companies do offer paid family leave men are still less likely to use that benefit. Discrimination against mothers also plays an important factor says Miller. Research shows that overall when women in the workforce have children they experience a pay cut. But when men have children they receive an increase pay which experts refer to as a fatherhood bonus.   We see statistically that when men and women make the same choices like having kids that it has a different impact in that men s wages actually go up says Miller. He also points out that rearing kids isn t a valid explanation as to why women as a whole earn less than men because many women opt not to have children.  Even when women stay in the workforce 100 percent of the time never have kids never leave the workforce we re still experiencing a pay gap says Miller. While it s true that women are more likely to work parttime jobs this doesn t play a role in the overall statistics because the data looks at fulltime workers explains Miller. Citing the American Time Use survey Miller notes that women spend more time doing care work such as taking care of kids and older family members and housework. While women are at home taking care of the domestic work men are able to have longer continuous work hours which research shows is given a pay premium in the workforce.. So this unpaid second shift that women are doing says Miller is subsidizing men s work.  Industries that laud working long hours such as investment banking exemplify this pay gap. Miller notes that these industries are the ones with the highest salaries and the highest gender pay gaps.  This is absolutely not factual says Miller. Women have been earning more college degrees than men for decades now. Today women earn about 56 percent of all bachelor s degrees in the United States. In fact women are also surpassing men in the number of earned master s degrees and doctorates says the researcher and they re almost reaching equity for medical and law degrees. In 2016 women earned the majority of doctoral degrees for the eighth consecutive year and they outnumber men in grad school 135 to 100 according to the American Enterprise Institute citing a Council of Graduate Schools report.  With a few exceptions obviously in engineering and STEM fields explains Miller women are massively more educated than men at this point.  While this increase in women earning advanced degrees plays a role in shrinking the gap as a whole says Miller the gap is even larger when you compare men and women s earnings at the same level of education.  These sorts of people with college degrees and advanced degrees are often in fields where there isn t really a ceiling on pay he says. And so men are rewarded disproportionately for the same jobs and for the same credentials as women.  Research shows that women are less likely to negotiate job offers and for good reason. Studies have found that when women ask for raises or try to negotiate their salary they are viewed unfavorably and can be penalized.  Women are more likely to see a blowback to being assertive and for demanding what they re worth explains Miller. When women ask for a raise they are seen as high maintenance and too demanding. Conversely when men ask for a raise they are seen as getting what they deserve says Miller. The researcher points to programs like the AAUW s salary negotiation workshop which trains women on the skills needed to make a pitch for a raise or a promotion. However he says that this isn t going to be the silver bullet to combat the pay gap since women can t negotiate their way past gender bias and discrimination. This one is a bit complicated says Miller. The issue isn t that women are deliberately setting out to find lower paying jobs but rather the jobs that women do are often valued less than men s. An analysis between 1950 and 2000 of the average salaries and occupations found that when women enter a field the wages drop even for men in that field because the career is considered less valuable when more women do it. The study shows that when a large number of women became designers wages occupation wide fell by 34 percent. When they became biologists wages fell by 18 percent. A more recent study by Cornell University found that the difference in occupations and job types between men and women is the single largest cause of the gender pay gap the New York Times reports.  It s not so much that men and women are choosing higher and lower paid fields and that s just the end of the story explains Miller. But when women do a job it s valued less and when men do a job it s valued more.  Miller highlights the fact that the 0.20 pay gap refers to all women. When you look at the gap by race black and Latina women make even less. Additionally this overall loss adds up quickly. In fact Miller notes that 0.20 comes out to about 10000 a year on average for fulltime workers in the United States. I don t know anyone in the workforce who would say 10000 a year is just play money says the researcher. Even when comparing women and men at lower wages for example those with a 5000 wage gap that loss in pay is still very significant especially for single family households and for women who don t have much money to begin with.  It really does make the difference between poverty and economic security says Miller. Women are more likely to be in poverty than men are and the gender pay gap is a large factor in why.

New research revisits this issue and finds evidence as to why prejudice deserves more weight in the debate. Do you think there should be laws against marriages between blacks and whites? If your party nominated a black candidate for president would you vote for him if he were qualified for the job? Responses to these and other similar questions can give researchers a valuable look into the racial sentiments of individuals and to ultimately study how these feelings affect social and economic outcomes. In a recent paper entitled Prejudice and Wages An Empirical Assessment of Becker s The Economics of Discrimination University of Chicago professors Kerwin Kofi Charles of the Harris School of Public Policy and Jonathan Guryan of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business use this type of survey data to analyze a rather controversial issue whether racial preferences affect the pay of black relative to white workers and how those preferences are carried out. That prejudice matters for determining wages may be seen by looking at the survey responses among whites in certain areas and the corresponding blackwhite wage gap in those areas. Charles and Guryan found for instance that blacks have much lower wages compared to whites in places where a higher fraction of whites report opposition to interracial marriage. The same is true in places where whites would not vote for a black president. These results suggest a strong link between prejudice and wages but they don t explain how exactly racial preferences determine the wage gap. Nobel laureate and University of Chicago professor Gary Becker s influential 1957 work on employer discrimination laid the foundation for understanding the relationship between racial bias and wages of blacks relative to whites. One of his model s surprising insights is that the racial aversion of the most prejudiced white employer does not affect the difference in pay between black and white workers. This might seem counterintuitive if one expects that an area that is relatively more prejudiced that is shows a higher average level of prejudice should have a larger wage gap. Although discrimination has been an intensely studied topic in economics since the publication of Becker s research no one had actually tested his model s predictions. Critics suggested that a wage difference based on prejudice cannot survive in the long run in a competitive labor market casting doubt on whether racial preferences play a role at all alongside other factors that could determine the wage gap such as differences in skills. Charles and Guryan are the first to test the key implications of Becker s model. Not only did the authors find overwhelming support for Becker s predictions but they also found that about onequarter of the overall blackwhite wage gap is due to racial prejudice. Becker defines prejudice as a distaste or aversion for cross racial contact. His model says that if employers are white and white employers have a choice between black and white workers who are perfect substitutes then prejudice would make an employer behave as if hiring a black worker is more expensive than it really is. This is because a prejudiced employer would have to be compensated for interacting with blacks. Put differently a prejudiced employer would hire black workers only if blacks receive a sufficiently lower wage than whites in order to make up for his discomfort. This suggests that the difference in wage between black and white workers will depend on just how strong an employer s racial bias is. However employers will surely have varying degrees of prejudice. Some may hate black workers but others may merely dislike them. Whose racial preferences will actually matter for determining the wage gap? Imagine that all employers were lined up according to their level of prejudice with those on the right more prejudiced than those on the left. Those at the right end of the distribution the employers who intensely dislike blacks may not hire black workers at all because they consider the cost of interacting with them to be too high. Therefore their racial bias should not matter for determining what black workers will be paid. Those at the left tail of the distribution on the other hand will more likely hire blacks because it is less costly for these relatively less prejudiced employers to do so. Ultimately the wage gap will be determined by the most prejudiced employer of all employers who end up hiring a black worker. This fascinating result implies that it is the racial preference of the marginal discriminator and not the average prejudice of all employers that matters for determining the wage gap. For instance even if the most prejudiced employer in market A is 100 times more averse to blacks than the most prejudiced employer in market B the blackwhite wage gap need not be bigger in A than in B. It all depends on the racial preference of that last employer who gave a black person a job. If for some reason that employer s bias against black workers worsens in the future then the wage gap will widen as well. Furthermore if the number of black workers in a market increases relative to the number of white workers then blacks will have to be sorted to ever more prejudiced employers along the distribution. The marginal employer the one who determines the wage will naturally be someone who is more averse to interacting with blacks. As a result holding the level of prejudice constant the difference in pay between blacks and whites will be bigger as the relative supply of black workers in a market increases. The wage gap could be zero even if there are many prejudiced employers in the market as long as the supply of black workers is such that all of them can be hired by unprejudiced employers. Becker s predictions have been sharply criticized by many over the years beginning with Becker himself but more famously by another Nobel laureate Kenneth Arrow of Stanford University. Arrow memorably remarked that Becker s employer discrimination model predicts the absence of the phenomenon it was designed to explain. He argued that prejudiced employers in a competitive market will be forced to shut down in the long run because they sacrifice profits by discriminating. If there is no reason to believe that the productive abilities of black workers are inferior to white workers then those employers whose decisions are not clouded by their dislike for blacks will stand to earn a greater profit because whites are more expensive to hire than blacks. Investors observe this difference in profit and will direct capital toward the most profitable companies. Over time competition should ensure that prejudiced employers will be driven out of the market and the racial wage gap will disappear. Such a criticism and its force in the literature may be one reason why it took some 50 years before Becker s insights could be tested using real data. But recent work has shown that prejudice can lead to persistent wage gaps if there is some form of imperfect information or imperfect competition. Moreover even under perfect competition Charles and Guryan have shown in an earlier paper that racial wage gaps need not vanish in the long run. They argued that it is quite possible for a prejudiced employer to stay open for business even if he has to sacrifice profits in order to enjoy isolation from a group he dislikes. After all an employer who is contemplating shutting down knows that he will eventually have to get a job and that job might entail interacting with blacks in his future workplace. Implicit in the criticisms of Becker s model is this unrealistic idea that prejudice is not portable across roles in the labor market explains Charles. That if I m prejudiced as an employer I somehow miraculously become unprejudiced if I shut down and become a worker.  Charles and Guryan recognized that there are enough good explanations out there for why racial wage gaps can survive in the long run that would justify testing Becker s predictions. To check whether Becker s insights hold up using real data Charles and Guryan look at the prejudice of white individuals as estimated from survey responses and relate that to the blackwhite wage gap across states. They empirically analyzed the importance of the average and marginal levels of prejudice on the wage gap and conducted a horse race between different points the median 10th and 90th percentiles on the prejudice distribution. The marginal level of prejudice is estimated by taking the pth percentile of the distribution where p is the fraction of the state workforce that is black. Just as Becker predicted the study found that the wage gap is largely determined by the tastes of the marginal discriminator and not by the average prejudice of whites. The relative supply of black workers matters too the wage gap widens with larger fractions of black workers in a state s workforce. Moreover the horse race revealed that the racial preferences of the relatively less prejudiced whites at the lower end of the distribution the 10th percentile have a large and negative effect on the wage gap while that of the most prejudiced whites the median and 90th percentiles have no effect at all. The study s results also can be used to compute the costs borne by black workers due to racial bias. If an 18yearold black male for example were to choose between two states in which to work Charles and Guryan estimate that by living in Florida rather than Massachusetts the 75th and 25th percentiles of the marginal prejudice distribution respectively the value of his lifetime earnings would fall by about 34000. The penalty is much bigger if he opts for Mississippi rather than Wisconsin states that are at the 90th and 10th percentiles of the distribution respectively. His earnings would drop by about 115000. While the study clearly found an important role for racial prejudice in generating differences in wages between black and white workers it also suggests that threequarters of this gap is due to something else. For instance firms may observe differences in skills between blacks and whites such that they sensibly decide to pay a lower wage to black workers. Another possibility is something called statistical discrimination. Employers don t necessarily dislike blacks but because they cannot properly assess the skills of black workers due to lack of information they fall back on stereotypes and generalizations that lead them to discriminate against blacks in terms of wages. If the blackwhite wage gap were due either to skill differences or statistical discrimination then a policy designed to equalize skill or make the assessment of the underlying skill easy and perfect for firms may have a chance at narrowing the gap. But if racial bias is as important as the study suggests then it might be more difficult or at least require a different strategy to close that gap. This logic extends to prejudice toward other groups as well. We say that even if test scores converged or even if women do as well as their peers there s a possibility that the reason I observe a wage difference has nothing to do with skills at all Charles says. The study by Charles and Guryan enriches the scholarly understanding of racial wage gaps by encouraging researchers to reexamine the role of racial preferences including the extent to which it can influence the prevailing arguments. It raises the interesting possibility that differences between racial groups are not exclusively due to skill and information differences but might in addition be due to this thing called prejudice says Charles. There has been a move in much of recent literature to discount that last possibility. Our results at the very least retard that discounting.

https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/06/racial-wealth-gap-may-be-a-key-to-other-inequities/,  Unequal is a series highlighting the work of Harvard faculty staff students alumni and researchers on issues of race and inequality across the U.S. This part looks at the racial wealth gap in America. The wealth gap between Black and white Americans has been persistent and extreme. It represents scholars say the accumulated effects of four centuries of institutional and systemic racism and bears major responsibility for disparities in income health education and opportunity that continue to this day. Consider that right now the net wealth of a typical Black family in America is around onetenth that of a white family. A 2018 analysis of U.S. incomes and wealth written by economists Moritz Kuhn Moritz Schularick and Ulrike I. Steins and published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis concluded The historical data also reveal that no progress has been made in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households over the past 70 years.  It s no surprise. After the end of slavery and the failed Reconstruction Jim Crow laws which existed till the late 1960s virtually ensured that Black Americans in the South would not be able to accumulate or to pass on wealth. And through the Great Migration and after African Americans faced employment housing and educational discrimination across the country. After World War II many white veterans were able to take advantage of programs like the GI Bill to buy homes the largest asset held by most American families with lowinterest loans but lenders often unfairly turned down Black applicants shutting those vets out of the benefit. As of the end of 2020 the homeownership rate for Black families stood at about 44 percent compared with 75 percent for white families according to the Census Bureau. Redlining typically the systemic denial of loans or insurance in predominantly minority areas held down property values and hampered African American families ability to live where they chose. The 2020 pandemic and its economic fallout had a disproportionate toll on people of color and many expect that it will widen the gap in various areas including wealth. At Harvard experts from different disciplines are studying the problem to find its roots and possible ways to level the playing field to ensure all have an equal chance to achieve the American dream. Here we will take a look at a few several of which focus on education as a longterm path out. Khalil Muhammad Ford Foundation Professor of History Race and Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School traces the roots of disparity to the Colonial period when the European settlement and conquest of North America took place. The process began in the second half of the 17th century said Muhammad when European settlers stripped Natives of their lands and used Africans as enslaved labor preventing them from fully participating in the economy and reaping the fruits of their work.  If we want to undo the cultural infrastructure that is hand in glove with the economic and political racism and domination of people we have to start very young says Khalil Muhammad of the Kennedy School and Harvard Radcliffe Institute.  The two dominant nonEuropean populations Indigenous and Africans were subjected to various coercive forms of labor that would be distinct from the experience of indentured European servants said Muhammad who is also the Suzanne Young Murray Professor at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute. And as such racism became an economic imperative to harness land and labor for the purpose of wealth creation and that did not change in any substantial way until really about the 1960s.  In fact the founders discovered that the issues of Black slavery and equality were so divisive that they opted to kick the can down the road hoping some future generation would prove wiser or better. With the Voting Rights Act of 1965 a crowning achievement of the Civil Rights Movement African Americans finally gained full citizenship. Many believed that would end the era of Black inequality but it did not said Muhammad because that thinking failed to account for how deeply systemic the problem had become. Such misconceptions have tended to make it difficult to gain widespread public support for the implementation of policies to close the disparities between Blacks and whites. That s why it s important to institutionalize antiracist practices and policies in civil society and government said Muhammad as well to better enforce antidiscrimination laws and investment in schools in lowincome neighborhoods. But he also believes a massive commitment to antibias education starting in kindergarten is necessary.  If we want to undo the cultural infrastructure that is hand in glove with the economic and political racism and domination of people we have to start very young said Muhammad. Antibias education is a social vaccine to vaccinate our children against the disease of racism. Imagine what the world would look like in a generation.  Over the past decades many scholars have examined the Blackwhite gap in household wealth. But it was in 1995 that sociologists Thomas Shapiro and Melvin Oliver put wealth inequality on the map with their groundbreaking book Black Wealth White Wealth. Their research analyzed the role of wealth or accumulated assets rather than that of income in the persistent racial divide.  Wealth is distinctive because it can be used as a cushion and it can be directly passed down across generations providing greater opportunity in the present and the future says Alexandra Killewald professor of sociology in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.   Income is unequal but wealth is even more unequal said Alexandra Killewald professor of sociology in the Faculty of Art and Sciences who studies inequality in the contemporary U.S.  You can think of income as water flowing into your bathtub whereas wealth is like the water that s sitting in the bathtub she said. If you have wealth it can protect you if you lose your job or your house. Wealth is distinctive because it can be used as a cushion and it can be directly passed down across generations providing families more choices and greater opportunity in the present and the future. Most scholars agree that the legacy of slavery and other subsequent forms of legal discrimination against African Americans have hindered their ability to accumulate wealth. Today s African American adults and children are living with the legacy of discrimination inequality and exclusion from slavery to redlining and other discriminatory practices said Killewald. And in turn white Americans are benefiting from legacies of advantage.  The typical white American family has roughly 10 times as much wealth as the typical African American family and the typical Latino family. In other words while the median white household has about 100000200000 net worth Blacks and Latinos have 1000020000 net worth. Depending on the year or how it s measured those numbers may change as shown by a report by the Pew Research Center but the wealth racial gap has continued for decades. It s a staggeringly large number said Killewald. The divide persists across generations said Killewald who researched the subject with coauthor Fabian Pfeffer of the University of Michigan in an article that included striking visualizations. One of them shows that Black parents tend to have much lower wealth than white parents and that Black and white children tend to follow the wealth position of their parents reproducing inequality across generations. The study concludes that today s blackwhite gaps in wealth arise from both the historical disadvantage reflected in the unequal starting position of black and white children and contemporary processes including continued institutionalized discrimination.  Many scholars consider education to be the key to narrowing the gap and economist Richard Murnane is one of them. During the last 40 years Murnane examined the interactions between the U.S. economy and its educational system and the ways in which it has affected the educational opportunities of lowincome children who are disproportionately Black or Latinx.  The extraordinary income inequality in the United States diminishes opportunities for lowincome families and for children of color said Murnane Juliana W. and William Foss Thompson Research Professor of Education and Society at the Graduate School of Education. Rising inequality has led to growing gaps in educational resources and learning opportunities between highincome families and their lowincome counterparts as well as residential and educational segregation by income. As a result inequality poses a danger to the promise that U.S. public education provides children with an equal chance at a better life than their parents. Unequal distribution of economic growth has played a major role in why children who earn more than their parents has declined sharply in America over the past half century says Raj Chetty a professor of economics and coauthor of the study The Fading American Dream Trends in Absolute Income Mobility Since 1940.   One statement that most everybody across the political spectrum agrees with is that if a child grows up poor but works hard and takes advantage of opportunities that child s children will have a better life said Murnane. That s less true now.  A study on the fading American dream coauthored by Raj Chetty William A. Ackman Professor of Economics and others concluded that absolute mobility the fraction of children who earn more than their parents has declined sharply in America over the past half century primarily because of the growth in inequality.  Economic mobility rates are lower in the U.S. than in some European countries and the American dream seems to grow more unreachable as inequality grows. Murnane warns that the government must address the problem as large sectors of the American population sink into despair and frustration.  A great many people especially males have grown up thinking they would take care of their families and the inability to do that has left them angry frustrated and depressed said Murnane. That was what they grew up expecting and that has not been possible for them. That s a deep challenge to how people feel about themselves. And that s a fundamental problem.  Economists Claudia Goldin Henry Lee Professor of Economics and Lawrence Katz Elizabeth Allison Professor of Economics believe that the solution to reducing income inequality which is strongly tied to the wealth gap is to close the educational divide. Goldin and Katz examined wages and income inequality in the U.S. from the end of the 19th century to the early 21st century in their trailblazing book The Race Between Education and Technology.  What they found was that in periods where there was improved access to education amid technological change as in the early 1900s when public high schools sprouted across the nation amid the Industrial Age workers earnings rose. Inequality began to grow in the 1980s as the economy started to shift toward knowledgebased industries and the supply of highly trained workers fell below demand. Expanding access to higher education could actually help reduce inequality say economists Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz.  File photos by Rose Lincoln and Kris SnibbeHarvard Staff Photographers Around that time the rates of college graduation began to decrease and overall high school graduation numbers leveled off. For Goldin and Katz expanding access to higher education could actually help reduce inequality.  You could wipe out a large fraction of inequality by ramping up the education of individuals who are limited in their ability to access and finish a college education said Goldin. The problem of wealth inequality is more extreme than income inequality since the former builds on the latter said Katz and their effects persists across generations. The legacies of the Jim Crow era and racism against Blacks are expressed today in residential segregation housing discrimination and discrimination in the labor market. For Katz who has been studying housing discrimination and its effects on upward mobility public policies can be implemented to reduce residential segregation. A study Katz coauthored with Chetty and Nathaniel Hendren professor of economics found that when lowincome families move to lowerpoverty neighborhoods with help of housing vouchers and assistance it is likely to reduce the persistence of poverty across generations. Chetty and Hendren along with John Friedman of Brown University were the cofounding directors of the Equality of Opportunity Project now expanded and called Opportunity Insights based at Harvard. Growing inequality is spoiling the chances to have a better life than the previous generation. Recent numbers show that the top 1 percent has seen their wages grow by 157 percent over the last four decades while the wages of the bottom 90 percent grew by only 24 percent. Inequality is one of the factors keeping the American dream out of reach said Goldin.  The American dream has sort of shifted from one in which the economic growth of the nation was shared more across the income distribution where the growth rate of the income of those at the bottom quartile was about the same if not more than the growth at the top quartile said Goldin. And today it s not that way at all the bottom quartile isn t going anywhere and the top is going rapidly up.  To keep the American dream alive and return to the era of shared prosperity the government must act said Katz. Both Goldin and Katz believe that an expansion of investment in higher education infrastructure and access to a highquality college education would have a powerful impact in the lives of many Americans. It could be similar to the effects of the high school movement which lifted millions of American families out of poverty during the first half of the 20th century.  In the early 20th century we allowed everyone access to high school said Katz. We have never done that for college even though college is as essential today as high school was 100 years ago.  The economic returns of a college degree are important but the social returns are also valuable said Anthony Jack assistant professor of education at the Graduate School of Education.  Workers who are more educated tend to be in jobs that are more recession and pandemic proof said Jack who also holds the Shutzer Assistant Professorships at the Radcliffe Institute. They also tend to live longer have better health outcomes and be more civically engaged. Education means more than just extra dollars in the bank. It s also the constellation of things that come along with it.  But the road to college has become increasingly harder especially for lowincome people even though access to college for disadvantaged students has increased over the past two decades. A report by the Pew Research Center found that the number of enrolled undergraduates from lowerincome backgrounds grew from 12 percent in 1996 to 20 percent in 2016. Most of that growth has taken place in public twoyear colleges and lessselective institutions.  Education may be the great equalizer but access to an equal education has never been part of the American story says Anthony Jack assistant professor of education at the Graduate School of Education.  Selective universities have also opened their gates to poor students however. In 1998 Princeton became the first Ivy League university to offer full financial aid to lowincome students and others followed suit. At Harvard 55 percent of undergraduates receive needbased scholarships and the 20 percent of Harvard parents who have total incomes below 65000 don t pay anything at all. Still access to college varies greatly by parent income according to a study by Opportunity Insights. Children with parents in the top 1 percent are 77 times more likely to attend elite colleges and universities than children with parents in the bottom 20 percent. To Jack those numbers showcase that access to college is highly unequal and is influenced by income race wealth and ZIP code. Education may be the great equalizer but access to an equal education has never been part of the American story he said. Higher education is highly stratified. The wealthier the family the higher the likelihood that students will enter a selective college. The inequality doesn t end there. What happens if you are one of the few lowincome students who make it into these elite schools?  For Jack that is not a rhetorical question. The middle son of a single mother who worked as a school security guard Jack rose from a workingclass neighborhood in Coconut Grove Fla. to attend Amherst College with the help of financial aid. He then came to Harvard where he graduated with a doctorate in sociology in 2016. Two years later Jack wrote the book The Privileged Poor How Elite Colleges are Failing Disadvantaged Students about what it s like to be a lowincome student in selective universities partly inspired by his own life. Elite universities have made progress in recruiting more lowincome students to their campuses but there is much more work to be done to ensure that those students use their four years there as a springboard to a better future the same way their richer counterparts do said Jack.  The real question is not only how to increase access to colleges and universities said Jack. We must pay attention to what happens once those lowincome students move into campus because that s where inequality gets reproduced in ways that are sometimes invisible but no less insidious.   So if greater access to public higher education would help close the wealth gap what we need is a kind of Marshall Plan to fix the system says economist David J. Deming professor of public policy and director of the Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at Harvard Kennedy School. That U.S. government initiative helped rebuild infrastructure and economy in Europe after the destruction of World War II. Deming s ambitious proposal would likewise focus resources on overhauling and expanding the size and number of two and fouryear public institutions with a goal of making access to college virtually universal.  We ought to set a goal of increasing access to higher education for lowincome students and students of color to basically equalize education opportunity said Deming. We need to invest in public higher education because it actually would make a difference in terms of intergenerational mobility.  For one public higher education is where most of the nation s postsecondary schooling takes place. A report by the National Center for Education Statistics found that of the 19.7 million college students enrolled in the fall of 2019 14.5 million attended public colleges and universities compared with 5.1 million enrolled in private institutions. David J. Deming s vision involves farreaching investment across twoyear colleges and fouryear universities. The number of students enrolled in postsecondary education has skyrocketed over the past five decades. The report predicted that by the fall of 2029 more than 20 million students will be enrolled in college. Of them nearly 15 million will attend public institutions. Deming s vision would involve farreaching investment across twoyear colleges and fouryear universities many of which have been historically underfunded and understaffed. Instructors are often adjunct faculty who teach large classes and have high course loads and many institutions lack tutoring and counseling services to help lessprepared students navigate through college. In terms of investment per student the scale of inequality in resources is much greater in higher education than it is at the K12 level. As an example Deming points out that a rich school district might spend 20 percent more per student than a poor school district whereas Harvard spends more than 100000 per year per student and Bunker Hill Community College spends about 10000 or 15000 per year per student.  Just purely in terms of dollars and cents the disparity is much much greater at the higher education level said Deming. Investing in higher public education won t solve all the myriad problems that affect inequality such as the declining minimum wage and discrimination in the labor market among others. But it would be a big first step he said.
