Now more than ever it s important for organizations to demonstrate a commitment to creating diverse and inclusive work environments for their employees. Workplace diversity refers to cultivating a team that comprises different genders races nationalities abilities and sexual orientations. Equity involves ensuring that all employees have access to resources opportunities and fair compensation. In inclusive workplaces all employees feel valued involved and supported which in turn cultivates trust motivation and greater job satisfaction. Whether you re an aspiring or current entrepreneur manager or HR professional the Certificate in Social Difference Diversity Equity and Inclusion is designed to provide the critical and analytical tools to identify unconscious biases that underpin inequality and marginalization and implement strategies that promote equality in the workplace and beyond. In this Ivy League 4course certificate program you ll develop a fluency and comfort level with the vocabulary of diversity equity and inclusion learn how to support psychological safety openness and accountability across diverse groups and discover how to contextualize social difference and structural bias in diverse professional contexts. Read on to explore why it is critical and beneficial for leaders and organizations to prioritize diversity and inclusion. What organization wouldn t want to see higher employee engagement increased innovation and improved financial performance? Work environments that comprise employees of different genders ethnicities sexualities ages and experience levels can foster increased creativity and innovation. If the entirety of a team has similar backgrounds and identities there is a likelihood it will produce similar ideas when brainstorming or innovating. However if a team comprises people with differing knowledge bases and perspectives who collaborate there is a greater likelihood they will produce inventive ideas and solutions. And when workplaces are inclusive it s more likely that employees will feel comfortable enough to share their unique ideas with colleagues and managers. Inclusion is also a key driver in improving job satisfaction and performance. Not only can creating diverse and inclusive workplaces benefit employee performance and innovation it can also benefit the bottom line. Recent research from McKinsey Company found that organizations in the top quartile for executivelevel gender diversity were 25 more likely to have aboveaverage profitability than those in the fourth quartile. And companies in the top quartile for ethnic and cultural diversity outperformed those in the fourth quartile by 36 in profitability.1 Suffice to say when leaders bring on people of different genders ethnicities and cultural backgrounds it can really pay off. Having a diverse and inclusive team can also improve a company s cultural awareness and understanding of nuances in today s global marketplace If an organization has an international client base for example then having employees who speak the languages and understand the cultures of those clients can improve communication and strengthen business relationships. A diverse workforce can also help businesses better understand their target markets promote themselves more effectively and quickly pinpoint opportunities as they arise. Additionally diverse teams of decisionmakers and problemsolvers can help prevent bad decisions that may alienate customers or clients hurt brands or prevent growth. Because diverse groups of people bring different experiences and points of view to the table there is a greater likelihood they will be challenged in a way that creates gamechanging solutions to problems. This level of diversity of thought can push team members toward a deeper mutual understanding and inspire innovation in a way that may not occur in a more homogenous group. Two courses from the Certificate in Social Difference Diversity Equity and Inclusion that are beneficial if you want to help build a more equitable workplace are ICOM 1000 Intercultural Communication and SDEI 2500 Race Place and Space. In the former you ll focus on key tenants of intercultural practices and strategies and build a foundation for understanding the intricate relationship between language culture and communication. In the latter you ll be introduced to the study of race within contemporary US society to help you gain a better grasp of how and why it continues to be such a powerful stratifying agent in social and intergroup relations and in economic and political hierarchies. High employee turnover rates are antithetical to successful businesses. According to data from the Society of Human Resource Management SHRM the cost of replacing an employee averages out to about onethird of their annual salary and results in additional losses in productivity time and knowledge for the organization.2 When multiple people leave an organization it can also negatively impact morale and reputation for remaining employees. If team members don t feel that their work is valued or taken seriously then they will eventually find a new place to work. As such it s important to provide an inclusive work culture in order to retain a diverse set of talent. If employees feel that they work in an equitable environment where they are appreciated they may experience greater job satisfaction feel increased pride in their work and serve as strong brand advocates for their employers. Workplace diversity and inclusion also increase the likelihood that a business will be able to attract and keep a large pool of talent. According to data from the CNBCSurveyMonkey 2021 Workforce Happiness Index almost 80 of respondents across the US said it is important for them to work at a company that prioritizes diversity and inclusion while more than half consider it very important. At the end of the day employees of all backgrounds desire and deserve to feel safe and comfortable and that they belong in their work culture.

https://www.claremontlincoln.edu/12-reasons-why-diversity-equity-and-inclusion-are-important-in-business/, To help business leaders with their efforts to be a more diverse and inclusive workplace we asked business professionals and executives why they are making changes to be inclusive at work. From nurturing a more positive workplace to generating fresh insights there are several reasons why investing in intentional Diversity Equity and Inclusion DEI practices is an imperative move for every business. When we make the case for the importance of DEI we can do so in two crucial ways the moral case and the business case. The human or moral case refers to our shared humanity and how when one group suffers we all suffer and when we invest in the equity of every group we all benefit. Heather McGhee s latest book The Sum of Us makes a strong case for this. From a business case if you want a workplace where you attract people who stay you have to pay attention to diversity and inclusion. PolicyLink has a great resource for illustrating the ROI dollars saved and made with a focus on equity. By investing in diverse people with situational fairness in mind you can save money by reducing costs on things like mental health and physical health. Investing in education also helps reduce these costs as you can also free all the innovative talent and contribution of people who think and create and consume differently. This creates better aligned choices for people with diverse interests and needs. Your business will attract potential candidates and customers when they see themselves represented among every level of your organization and workforce. A sense of shared power and opportunity translates to better products and services and happier more committed staff and colleagues! Audrey D. Jordan Ph.D. Claremont Lincoln University Jerry D. Campbell Professor and DEI Specialist Diversity equity and inclusion provide a much broader perspective for problemsolving and developing creative solutions for a competitive advantage and greater success. DEI creates and fosters an open learning environment for the betterment of your employees which ultimately produces quality products and services for your customers. Dr. Robert Sellers chief diversity officer at the University of Michigan breaks down the distinction between diversity equity and inclusion in this way Diversity is where everyone is invited to the party Equity means that everyone gets to contribute to the playlist Inclusion means that everyone has the opportunity to dance. When businesses prioritize DEI it encourages a more innovative positive environment which in turn creates a more profitable company. And most importantly it means we all get to dance! When diversity equity and inclusion are made a priority at your business every facet of your organization can benefit including your bottom line. We work with a wide range of people providing insurance to renters truckers business owners and homeowners. We want our company to reflect the kind of diversity that we see in our customers so they know they are being represented and understood. Teams are 158 more likely to understand target customers when they have at least one member who represents their target s gender race age sexual orientation or culture. At Lyon Shield Security our employees are our most valuable asset. We value strength reliance and integrity in all that we do. Effective verbal and written communication the ability to make good decisions under pressure and the capability to implement specific instructions are valued qualities. Looking for guards and dispatchers that value diversity equity in inclusion is also a top priority when looking for a candidate. We need employees that are accepting of each other and others. We strive to look for diverse individuals that are willing to do their job and do it well! DEI is the actual walk behind the talk. When it comes to creating change it is not enough just to talk about it. There must be action behind the words and when businesses focus on DEI they are putting in the work behind their words in the mission or values of the company. A 2017 study found that businesses that invested in DEI also saw increases in their returns on sales and invested capital and employees saw that their ideas were put into development. There are tangible results to adding equity and diversity into your business. Don t just speak about it be about it. Businesses need to include diversity equity and inclusion because it shows consumers and employees that you are not afraid to give opportunities to all people. Everyone deserves an opportunity to show their work skills and having DEI in a business gives everyone a chance. Employees want to work for a company that gives opportunities and is inclusive of all people. That is why it is important. Diversity and inclusion are essential to creating an infrastructure that mirrors the market we reside in. Our demographic stems from people of all backgrounds within our great country and therefore meeting the image our flags convey with the same inclusive atmosphere at our company provides us a sense of integrity and authenticity which helps us maintain even better customer relationships. Our employees are veterans and men and women of all backgrounds and we strive to give voice to their concerns and involve them in decisions when applicable. A solid team dynamic thrives off diversity and the different viewpoints those from various nationalities and genders provide. Just like in modern history it was in countries like the Netherlands that through inclusive policies and diversity managed to get economically and socially ahead of countries that were expelling those who belonged to different religions. So it is in the modern enterprise. Diversity and inclusiveness are more than just about reaching quotas. The upsides are actually scandalously underrated. To have these in your company translates immediately into fresh insights perspectives ideas languages contacts and professional cultures. There is really much to gain from diversity and organizations can be a melting pot for those benefits. In the world we all live in today being a globally appealing company is king. Global appeal means including different groups of people ways of thinking and treating all people with respect. A company of any size needs to have this global appeal. The reasons are endless as to why companies should promote diversity inclusion and equity. For one there are higher prospects for creativity and innovation. When you allow different people with different skills backgrounds and outlooks on life to work together there s no limit to what they will create. And as a leader you want to encourage those differences to be celebrated and explored. It s what makes companies relatable and global. Cultivating an inclusive work environment can actually reduce employee turnover. It s a logical conclusion when you realize that staff who feel valued and that their voice is heard will stay with a company longer than those who don t. Inclusion diversity and equity empower your employees to take pride in their work and the company.

WashingtonJuly 27 2023Ruth BlackGetty ImagesBusinesses are reconsidering whether they need to change their DEI strategies. The short answer is They don t. In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ban on affirmative action at colleges and universities state legislation attaching diversity equity and inclusion efforts on campus and more general attacks on DEI companies are considering whether they need to change their DEI strategies. The short answer is they don t. But it is a good time to review corporate values personnel policies and engage with employees on these issues. The first step should be to remember the moral and business cases for DEI. They remain strong. Second you might reconsider using DEI labels as some have suggested. But given employee support for such initiatives proceed cautiously. Next review HR practices like recruiting including casting a wider net for candidates since the college pipeline will now be less diverse onboarding since some students will have less exposure to DEI than others and performance reviews pay and promotion to ensure there is no racial bias. Finally communicate carefully with what is sure to be a polarized workforce. Present credible research solicit opinions work to bridge divides. Ultimately you want your organization to move forward in a way that is aligned with your organizational values. Businesses are reconsidering whether they need to change their DEI strategies. The short answer is They don t. The recent U.S. Supreme Court decision banning affirmative action specifically raceconscious admissions in colleges and universities may not directly impact U.S. workplaces but there s no question that corporate America needs to consider the effect this and potential future judicial rulings and state legislation will have on their DEI practices.

Workplace diversity equity and inclusion efforts or DEI are increasingly becoming part of national political debates. For a majority of employed U.S. adults 56 focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing according to a new Pew Research Center survey. But opinions about DEI vary considerably along demographic and political lines. Most workers have some experience with DEI measures at their workplace. About sixinten 61 say their company or organization has policies that ensure fairness in hiring pay or promotions and 52 say they have trainings or meetings on DEI at work. Smaller shares say their workplace has a staff member who promotes DEI 33 that their workplace offers salary transparency 30 and that it has affinity groups or employee resource groups based on a shared identity 26. Majorities of those who have access to these measures say each has had a positive impact where they work. Related How Americans View Their Jobs This nationally representative survey of 5902 U.S. workers including 4744 who are not selfemployed was conducted Feb. 612 2023 using the Center s American Trends Panel.1 The survey comes at a time when DEI efforts are facing some backlash and many major companies are laying off their DEI professionals. A majority of workers 56 say focusing on increasing diversity equity and inclusion at work is mainly a good thing 28 say it is neither good nor bad and 16 say it is a bad thing. Views on this vary along key demographic and partisan lines. Half or more of both men and women say focusing on increasing DEI at work is a good thing but women are more likely than men to offer this view 61 vs. 50. In turn men are more than twice as likely as women to say it is a bad thing 23 vs. 9. About twothirds or more of Black 78 Asian 72 and Hispanic 65 workers say that focusing on DEI at work is a good thing. Among White workers however fewer than half 47 say it s a good thing in fact 21 say it s a bad thing. But there are wide partisan gender and age gaps among White workers with majorities of White Democrats women and those under age 30 saying focusing on DEI at work is a good thing. Workers under 30 are the most likely age group to say focusing on DEI at work is a good thing. About twothirds 68 of workers ages 18 to 29 say this compared with 56 of workers 30 to 49 46 of those 50 to 64 and 52 of those 65 and older. Views also differ by educational attainment with 68 of workers with a postgraduate degree saying focusing on DEI at work is a good thing compared with 59 of those with a bachelor s degree only and 50 of those with some college or less education. Democratic and Democraticleaning workers are much more likely to say focusing on DEI at work is a good thing 78 than to say it is a bad thing 4 or that it is neither good nor bad 18. Views among Republican and Republicanleaning workers are more mixed Some 30 say focusing on DEI at work is a good thing while the same share 30 say it s a bad thing and 39 say it s neither good nor bad. When it comes to the focus of their own employer 54 of workers say their company or organization pays about the right amount of attention to increasing diversity equity and inclusion. The remainder are divided between saying their employer pays too much 14 or too little attention 15 or that they re not sure 17. Women are more likely than men to say their employer pays too little attention to increasing DEI 17 vs. 12. In turn men are more likely than women to say too much attention is paid to this where they work 18 vs. 10. Black workers 28 are the most likely to say their company or organization pays too little attention to increasing DEI compared with smaller shares of White 11 Hispanic 19 and Asian 17 workers who say the same. Views on this question also differ by party. While half or more of both Republican and Democratic workers say their company or organization pays the right amount of attention to DEI Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say their employer pays too little attention to it 21 vs. 7. In turn Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say their employer pays too much attention to DEI 24 vs. 6. While a majority of workers say focusing on increasing diversity equity and inclusion at work is a good thing relatively small shares place great importance on working at a place that is diverse when it comes to gender race and ethnicity age and sexual orientation. About threeinten workers say it s extremely or very important to them to work somewhere with a mix of employees of different races and ethnicities 32 and ages 28 while 26 say the same about having about an equal mix of men and women. And 18 say this about having a mix of employees of different sexual orientations at their workplace. Women are more likely than men to say it s extremely or very important to them to work at a place that is diverse across all measures asked about in the survey. For example there are 11 percentage point differences in the shares of women compared with men saying it is extremely or very important to them to work somewhere that has a mix of employees of different races and ethnicities 37 vs. 26 and about an equal mix of men and women 31 vs. 20. Black workers are among the most likely to value racial ethnic and age diversity in the workplace. Some 53 of Black workers say it is extremely or very important to them to work somewhere with a mix of employees of different races and ethnicities compared with 39 of Hispanic workers and 25 of White workers who say the same 43 of Asian workers say this is important to them. There is no statistically significant difference between the share of Asian workers and the shares of Black and Hispanic workers who hold this view. And while 42 of Black workers highly value working somewhere with a mix of employees of different ages smaller shares of Hispanic 33 Asian 30 and White 24 workers say the same. When it comes to diversity of sexual orientation 28 of Black workers and 22 of Hispanic workers say it is extremely or very important to them to work somewhere that is diverse in this way 15 each among White and Asian workers say the same. Workers under age 50 are more likely than those 50 and older to say racial and ethnic diversity in their workplace is extremely or very important to them 35 vs. 26. Workers younger than 50 are also more likely to say having about an equal mix of men and women is important to them with workers ages 18 t0 29 the most likely to say this 34 vs. 26 of workers 30 to 49 and 20 each among those 50 to 64 and 65 and older. There are also differences by educational attainment with larger shares of workers with a postgraduate degree than those with less education saying it s extremely or very important to them that their workplace is diverse across all measures asked about in the survey. For example 44 of workers with a postgraduate degree say having a mix of employees of different races and ethnicities is extremely or very important to them compared with 34 of those with a bachelor s degree only and 27 of those with some college or less. Democratic workers are much more likely than Republican workers to say working somewhere that is diverse when it comes to gender race and ethnicity age and sexual orientation is extremely or very important to them. In fact about half of Democrats 49 place great importance on having a mix of employees of different races and ethnicities where they work compared with 13 of Republicans. And there are differences of at least 20 points between the shares of Democrats and Republicans saying it s extremely or very important to them to work somewhere that has about an equal mix of men and women 39 of Democrats say this vs. 12 of Republicans and a mix of employees of different ages 39 vs. 17 and sexual orientations 27 vs. 7. Overall a majority of workers say their workplace has a mix of employees of different ages 58 say this describes their current workplace extremely or very well. Smaller shares say their workplace has about an equal mix of men and women 38 and a mix of employees of different races and ethnicities 46 and sexual orientations 28. These assessments do not vary much across demographic groups. Half of workers say it is extremely or very important to them to work somewhere that is accessible for people with physical disabilities 29 say it is somewhat important and 21 say it is not too or not at all important to them. Highly valuing an accessible workplace varies by gender race and ethnicity and party but there is no significant difference in responses between those who do and don t report having a disability. About sixinten women 58 say it is extremely or very important to them that their workplace is accessible compared with 41 of men. Black workers are more likely than workers of other racial and ethnic groups to place great importance on their workplace being accessible 62 of Black workers say this is extremely or very important compared with 51 of Hispanic 48 of White and 43 of Asian workers. A majority of Democrats 59 say it is extremely or very important to them to work somewhere that is accessible for people with physical disabilities 40 of Republican say the same. Some 27 of Republicans say this is not too or not at all important to them compared with 15 of Democrats. There is no statistically significant difference in the shares of workers who have a disability and those who do not saying it is extremely or very important to them to work somewhere that is accessible for people with physical disabilities. But workers who do not have a disability are more likely than those who do to say this is not too or not at all important to them 21 vs. 15. Among those who don t work fully remotely about threequarters of workers 76 say their workplace is at least somewhat accessible for people with physical disabilities with 51 saying it is extremely or very accessible. Some 17 say their workplace is not too or not at all accessible and 8 are not sure. When asked whether the company or organization they work for has a series of measures that are typically associated with diversity equity and inclusion efforts a majority of workers say their employer has policies that ensure everyone is treated fairly in hiring pay or promotions 61 and 52 say there are trainings or meetings on DEI where they work. Smaller shares say their workplace has a staff member whose main job is to promote DEI at work 33 a way for employees to see the salary range for all positions 30 and groups created by employees sometimes known as affinity groups or employee resource groups ERGs based on shared identities such as gender race or being a parent 26. Responses do not vary much by most demographic characteristics. However workers with at least a bachelor s degree are consistently more likely than those with less education to say each of these five measures is available where they work. Among those whose workplace offers each policy or resource a majority of workers say each measure has had a somewhat or very positive impact where they work. About a third or fewer workers say each resource has had neither a positive nor negative impact and about oneinten or fewer say each of these has had a somewhat or very negative impact. Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to say their workplace has these measures in place but Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the impact of each has been positive by margins ranging from 10 to 32 points among those who say their workplace has these measures. For example 66 of Democrats who say their workplace has a way for employees to see the salary range for all positions say this has had a somewhat or very positive impact compared with 56 of Republicans who say this. And while about threequarters of Democrats 74 say having a staff member whose main job is to promote DEI at work has had a positive impact fewer than half of Republicans 42 say the same. Women are more likely than men to say each of these policies and resources has had a very or somewhat positive impact where they work. This is mainly driven by gender differences among Republicans There are doubledigit differences in the shares of Republican women and Republican men who say many of these resources have had a positive impact. For example 58 of Republican women say having a staff member whose main job is to promote DEI at work has had at least a somewhat positive impact where they work compared with 31 of Republican men who hold this view. The same share of Republican women 58 say having affinity groups or ERGs has had a positive impact compared with 38 of Republican men who say the same. Among Democrats majorities of both men and women offer positive assessments of these resources in their workplace but Democratic women are more likely than Democratic men to say having trainings or meetings on DEI at work have had a positive impact 72 vs. 65. While there are differences by race ethnicity and age on overall attitudes about DEI in the workplace there are no consistent differences along these dimensions in how workers with access to these policies and resources at their workplace assess their impact. Out of all workers about fourinten 38 have participated in a DEI training in the last year. A similar share 40 did not participate or say their workplace does not offer these trainings and 21 are not sure if their employer offers these trainings. Looking only at those whose company or organization has trainings or meetings on DEI about threequarters 73 say they have participated in such trainings in the past year. And assessments of these trainings tend to be positive with 53 of workers who ve participated saying they were very or somewhat helpful. About a third 34 give a more neutral assessment saying the trainings were neither helpful nor unhelpful and 13 say they were very or somewhat unhelpful. While men and women are about equally likely to have participated in trainings on DEI in the past year women are more likely than men to say the trainings have been at least somewhat helpful 60 vs. 46. Republicans and Democrats are also equally likely to say they ve participated in these trainings in the past year but Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say the trainings have been helpful 66 vs. 36. About oneinfive Republicans say they ve been unhelpful 19 compared with 9 of Democrats. While both Democratic men and women offer similar assessments of the DEI trainings they ve participated in there are gender differences among Republican workers. Republican women are more likely than Republican men to say the trainings they ve participated in have been helpful 47 vs. 28. Conversely 22 of Republican men compared with 14 of Republican women say the trainings have been unhelpful. While 26 of workers say there are affinity groups or employee resource groups ERGs where they work members of these groups account for a very small share of workers overall. Just 6 of workers say they are members of an affinity group or ERG with 58 of workers saying these groups are either not available at their workplace or that they aren t a member. Another 37 say they are not sure if their workplace offers these groups.  Among workers who say there are affinity groups or ERGs at their workplace 22 say they are personally a member. Women are more likely than men to be members of these groups 28 vs. 16. And 28 of nonWhite workers say they are a member of an affinity group or ERG compared with 18 of White workers.2 When asked about the impact a person s gender race or ethnicity has on their ability to succeed at work workers tend to say these characteristics neither make it easier nor harder to be successful at their workplace. Still when it comes to gender workers are more likely to say being a man makes it easier to be successful where they work than to say it makes it harder 36 vs. 6. In contrast a larger share says being a woman makes it harder to be successful than say it makes it easier 28 vs. 11. Men and women have different views on the impact gender has on a person s ability to succeed where they work. Some 44 of women say being a man makes it at least a little easier to be successful including 24 who say it makes it a lot easier. This compares with 29 of men who say being a man makes it at least a little easier to be successful. Similarly 34 of women say being a woman makes it harder to be successful where they work compared with 21 of men. Women under age 50 are especially likely more so than women ages 50 and older or men in either age group to say being a man makes it easier to be successful where they work and that being a woman makes it harder. For example 38 of women ages 18 to 49 say being a woman makes it harder to be successful where they work. This compares with 29 of women 50 and older 25 of men younger than 50 and an even smaller share of men 50 and older 13. When it comes to views about how race or ethnicity affects people s ability to succeed at work 51 of Black workers say being Black makes it harder to be successful where they work. This is significantly higher than the shares of Asian 41 Hispanic 23 and White 18 workers who say the same about the impact of being Black. Similarly about fourinten Asian workers 39 say being Asian makes it harder to be successful in their workplace a higher share than workers of other racial and ethnic groups who say the same about being Asian. Hispanic Black and Asian workers are about equally likely to say being Hispanic makes it harder to be successful where they work. A smaller share of White workers say the same about being Hispanic. When asked about the impact of being White in their workplace workers across racial and ethnic groups are more likely to say it makes it easier than to say it makes it harder to be successful. This is especially the case among Black and Asian workers. About half of Black 52 and Asian 51 workers say being White makes it easier to be successful where they work compared with 37 of Hispanic and 24 of White workers who say the same about being White. Previously released findings from this survey found that Black workers are more likely than White Hispanic and Asian workers to report that they have experienced discrimination or have been treated unfairly by an employer in hiring pay or promotions because of their race or ethnicity at some point in their careers though not necessarily where they currently work. Women are also more likely than men to say they ve experienced such discrimination because of their gender. There are large partisan gaps in views of whether gender race or ethnicity make it easier or harder to be successful at work. Some 47 of Democratic workers say being a man makes it at least somewhat easier to be successful at their workplace compared with 25 of Republican workers. Democrats are also more likely than Republicans to say being a woman makes it harder to succeed 37 vs. 17. Democratic and Republican women are more likely than their male counterparts to say being a woman makes it harder and being a man makes it easier to be successful where they work. The differences between Republican women and Republican men are particularly striking. About a quarter of Republican women 26 say being a woman makes it harder to be successful compared with 10 of Republican men. And while 36 of Republican women say being a man makes it easier to be successful where they work just 16 of Republican men say the same. Democratic workers are more than three times as likely as Republican workers to say being White makes it easier to succeed where they work 48 vs. 13 and they are also more likely than Republicans to say being Black Hispanic or Asian makes it harder. About fourinten Democrats 39 say being Black makes it harder for someone to succeed at their workplace compared with just 9 of Republicans. Similarly 30 of Democrats say being Hispanic makes it harder to succeed compared with 8 of Republicans. And while smaller shares in both parties say being Asian makes it harder to succeed Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say this 16 vs. 6. These partisan differences remain when looking only at Democrats and Republicans who are White. Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers
https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbescommunicationscouncil/2022/03/03/the-importance-of-diversity-and-inclusion-for-todays-companies/,   Diversity and inclusion are essential today something I have seen firsthand within Penn Community Bank. D I allows organizations to be more inclusive of different ideas cultures and lifestyles leading to improved company culture. It also puts companies in the position to hire the best employees from a diverse and often untapped candidate pool while increasing customer satisfaction with their services. I have found that diversity brings together people from different backgrounds showcases a variety of perspectives and leads to innovation and creativity. When you bring people together from all walks of life different genders backgrounds and races it s amazing what we can accomplish. So what are the benefits of D I efforts and how can you implement them? Having a diverse workforce means happier and healthier employees customers feel more respected and managers have greater access to the talent and skillsets they need for their organizations to thrive. A study from Harvard Business Review found that diverse companies had a 19 higher innovation revenue. But even with those benefits many banks have been slow to integrate diversity into their ranks. This reluctance may be due to misunderstanding what inclusion means for banking and how it improves all aspects of your operations. As part of PennCB s leadership team I think it s essential to focus on diversity if you want to do great business. Many consumers want to do business with institutions they can relate to personally which requires a diverse staff and management team. This is especially true of diverse communities we want our team to reflect the customers we serve. Plus ethnically diverse companies are 35 more likely to outperform while genderdiverse companies are 15 more likely to do so. You re missing out on talent if you re not reaching different demographics in the communities that you serve. The definition of diversity and inclusion can be interpreted in many ways. Still at its core it is the understanding that everyone is unique and should be respected for their differences. This includes race ethnicity gender identity sexual orientation socioeconomic status religion age and abilities. D I efforts are needed to create an environment where everyone feels welcome and can contribute their best ideas and talents a company s success depends on its ability to innovate and develop new solutions. To do this you need a creative workforce with various skillsets which diversity provides. There s a lot of evidence in favor of having a diverse and inclusive workforce not only in terms of creating new ideas but also in creating an attractive environment for jobseekers. By 2025 estimates predict the workforce will be 75 millennials which will continue to be another driving force for D I. This segment of the workforce highly values diversity with a 2016 survey reporting that 47 of millennials actively look for diversity in the workplace meaning that diversity should also be a primary concern for organizations looking to attract the best and brightest employees. At Penn Community Bank diversity benefits us because it allows us to attract better talent and best serve different communities in our markets which opens new opportunities for us to grow. A diverse workforce helps banks and companies attract new customers in the community from all walks of life as people want to do business with institutions that share their values. For many those values are inclusion and diversity. There are many ways that companies can enhance their inclusion efforts. Some simple things you can do include conducting training on cultural sensitivity developing an employee resource group for people of diverse backgrounds and creating an inclusive environment in which everyone is welcome to voice their opinions. You can also reach out to local organizations that support diversity and inclusion and partner with them to spread the message. Most importantly companies must ensure their policies and practices reflect the importance of diversity and inclusion. This includes setting diversity goals making a commitment to hiring a diverse workforce and tracking the diversity of the workforce. By embracing diversity and inclusion you create a more equitable and inclusive workplace for everyone. Institutions can track their progress toward becoming more diverse and inclusive through resources such as employee groups. These are opportunities for employees to get together and help one another solve problems enhance career development and share industry best practices. Diversity can also be measured through metrics that track the makeup of an organization s leadership team such as the ratio of diversity among in the case of the banking industry your tellers and other roles. Beyond your organization you can promote diversity and inclusion through acts such as hosting events to show appreciation for diversity or rewarding scholarships locally further connecting your organization with the community you serve. When companies embrace diversity and inclusion it leads to a more productive and profitable workforce. Diverse teams are often more creative and innovative which leads to new ideas and solutions to ensure you remain competitive in a world increasingly focused on social issues and leveling the playing field for underrepresented groups. Companies that embrace diversity also tend to be more successful in reaching a wider audience. All in all it s clear that embracing diversity is not only the right thing to do but it s also good for business. The importance of diversity and inclusion in banking is something that many people don t think about but it s the key to maximizing operations in this industry and beyond. The benefits speak for themselves it offers an inclusive atmosphere that will help you attract a diverse group of employees which can be leveraged to brainstorm new ideas for your company. We need more diverse thought leadership not just from women or minorities but across all spectrums. I ve seen firsthand the importance of an institution being dedicated to creating opportunities for current and prospective employees while improving the customer experience through D I efforts.

https://www.achievers.com/blog/diversity-and-inclusion/,  According to Deloitte diverse companies enjoy 2.3 times higher cash flow per employee and Gartner found that inclusive teams improve team performance by up to 30 percent in highdiversity environments. Yet only 40 percent of employees agree that their manager fosters an inclusive environment. Popular HR influencer Brene Brown says we need to do more than diversity and equity and inclusion. We need to create real belonging in our culture. In her own business Brown has reframed diversity equity and inclusion DEI efforts as DEIB which stands for Diversity Equity Inclusion and Belonging. Our philosophy on D I is rooted in two themes connection and belonging. These elements must go handinhand in the workplace in order to truly make an impact. Diversity and inclusion is an organization s effort policies and practices that ensure different groups or individuals of different backgrounds are culturally and socially accepted and integrated into the workplace. An organization that focuses on diversity and inclusion will employ a diverse team of people that reflects the society in which it operates. Diversity refers to political beliefs race culture sexual orientation religion class andor gender identity differences. In the workplace diversity means your staff consists of individuals who bring new perspectives and backgrounds to the table. Inclusion means that everyone in the diverse mix feels involved valued respected treated fairly and embedded in your culture. Empowering all employees and recognizing their special talents is part of creating an inclusive company. Both aspects of D I are important diversity without inclusion can result in a toxic culture and inclusion without diversity can make a company stagnant and uncreative. Companies are starting to focus more on diversity but many disregard the inclusion piece of the puzzle. Without a concerted effort towards both inclusion and diversity your workforce will feel out of place and unsupported. The Quick Guide to Diversity and Inclusion in the Workplace DEI B stands for diversity equity inclusion and belonging. In the workplace these are organizational values demonstrated through hiring individuals of different backgrounds and perspectives and encouraging their participation and success. Diversity includes equal representation of different ethnicities ages genders. The Achievers Workforce Institute defines belonging as an experience of connection security and community it s about feeling at home in one s place without reservation. A true sense of belonging at work is the deepest outcome measure of engagement.  A diverse and inclusive environment establishes a sense of belonging among employees making them feel more connected and productive.

Diversity will improve your current business and 67 percent of workers consider diversity when seeking employment. Hiring more diverse individuals is crucial in attracting more interested qualified applicants. When employees feel included they re more engaged and go the extra mile for the organization having a ripple effect on profitability team morale and retention. People working in inclusive workplaces also tend to have better physical and mental health and take less leave for health issues. When companies support D I initiatives a whopping 83 percent of millennials are actively engaged in their work. What s more by building an inclusive work environment you can instill greater trust between employees and leadership. Since only 1 in 5 HR and engagement leaders agree that their employees deeply trust their company leaders teaching leaders to recognize and reward employees for doing their best work can alleviate this issue. To be truly inclusive all employees must recognize each other. Learn how to strengthen engagement and facilitate trust with your workforce The Harvard Business Review found a statistically significant relationship between diversity and innovation outcomes. The most diverse enterprises in terms of migration industry career path gender education age were also the most innovative as measured by their revenue mix. Diverse teams can also better identify products and services that fit the needs of emerging customer profiles. Diverse teams make better decisions. Cloverpop an online decisionmaking platform examined 600 business decisions made by 200 teams. They found that diverse teams have a 60 percent improvement in decisionmaking. In particular genderdiverse teams outperformed individual decision makers 73 percent of the time and teams diverse in geography gender and age made better business decisions than individuals 87 percent of the time. Diversity is a competitive differentiator McKinsey found that for every 10 percent increase in gender diversity EBIT rose by 3.5 percent. Companies with significantly more racial and ethnic diversity are 35 percent more likely to outperform competitors. Harvard Business Review also discovered that diverse companies are 70 percent more likely to capture new markets which in turn yields higher performance. Harvard Business Review found that more diverse companies report 19 percent higher revenue. Additionally businesses that are in the top quartile for racial ethnic and gender diversity have a 25 percent greater likelihood of being more profitable than the national median for their respective industry. This is especially true during times of crisis. Great Place to Work assessed hundreds of publicly traded companies before during and after a recession. Highly diverse inclusive companies experienced a 14.4 percent gain while the S P 500 saw a 35.5 percent decline in stock performance.  Bringing DEI to life within your organization can take on various forms. Examples include It s important for an organization to understand and address each of these areas to better address diversity in the workplace. To nurture and drive diversity equity and inclusion in the workplace it s important to have a framework that clearly guides an organization s efforts. The four key pillars to include in your strategy should be Equity and connection are values at the heart of diversity and inclusion. At its core diversity and inclusion is intended to support different groups of individuals such as those from different races ethnicities religions abilities genders and sexual orientations. Many organizations build their diversity and inclusion values and strategies into their overarching core company values so that they are an intrinsic part of the organization s guiding principles.  Creating a diverse and inclusive workplace is easier said than done. Below are some of the top challenges that organizations face when it comes to leveling up their diversity and inclusion strategies. D I initiatives must align with your organizational goals and values. A study of Fortune 1000 companies showed that 41 percent of respondents said their organizations had very informal diversity efforts with no structure because they re too busy . Organizational change begins at the top. Upper management needs to allocate resources to D I efforts even in the face of uncertainty. Once you ve garnered adequate support ask critical questions about your company s workforce. Oftentimes these questions bring about tough but necessary conversations to drive true change. HR department and individual managers are responsible for enacting change and sustaining a D Icentric culture. These groups should receive training and present a unified front that upholds D I practices while measuring the company s progress toward D I goals. The only way to know if D I is improving in your organization is to measure and track it. An annual survey is not enough. You need to practice continuous listening and collect realtime insights into what your employees are thinking and feeling. Continuously give employees the opportunity to voice D I concerns as they have an inthetrenches view of possible conflicts that managers may not. Use this feedback to think of new ways to incorporate peoplecentric initiatives and build a trustful relationship with employees to foster better overall performance. Be sure to measure diversity and inclusion related KPIs before and after implementing each new D I initiative. Look at the change or lack of change in metrics. Coming up with diversity KPIs is relatively simple if you break down your workforce by gender race geography etc. Inclusion is tougher to measure but there are two key ways to do it. First look at the Inclusion Climate equitable employment practices integration of differences and inclusion of decisionmaking. Second measure the Perceived Group Inclusion Scale. This gauges employees sense of belonging and authenticity. Remember Gathering data is just one piece of the puzzle. You need to follow up and take action to ensure that you re using insights to strengthen your approach and impact. Find out how to fuel your HR team with data and properly measure Manager require training on D I goals why they re important and what s expected of managers. Leadership teams need to lead by example from integrating D I into their hiring interview process to the way they treat their fellow employees. Every manager should build an inclusive team environment by recognizing their biases listening to their employees and recognizing them for their everyday efforts. Employees too should receive D I training to help avoid and overcome biases. Training sessions need to show that companies know about current biases in the workplace and explain how your D I program is an opportunity for all employees to acknowledge and improve. Many organizations struggle with silos which encourage exclusivity rather than inclusivity decrease productivity and productivity etc. Before deploying a recognition program Meijer a familyowned superstore based out of the U.S. Midwest was aware that silos could severely hinder collaboration. After implementing their recognition program the strength of networks in each Meijer store location increased. Discover how to strengthen connections across your organization Breaking down silos and increasing connections across your company are instrumental in strengthening D I throughout your organization. Unsure where to start? Try Meijer s approach and start leveraging the power of employee recognition.  There are myriad ways to start incorporating diversity into your workplace. Here are a few of the ideas to get started. Objective criteria reduces the chance of bias or prejudice. Meet as a team to openly discuss these criteria and build collaborative actions plans together to avoid unconscious bias as much as possible. One way to collect everyone s point of view is to use something like Achiever s Action Builder feature which allows managers and teams to find a focus build a plan and collaborate on effective action. Appreciating employees for who they are shows that you care about them as a person. Take full advantage of an engaging recognition and rewards program that encourages your workforce to publicly celebrate their peers strengths but also their uniqueness. Employees should be recognized by their csuite managers and peers for everyday wins both small and big.  From a leader s perspective a tool like recognition should be used to promote inclusive leadership. How HCM Technologies Can Scale Inclusion in the Workplace by Gartner Recognition tools should be used to promote your company values especially the ones that speak to your company s D I initiatives. Give your employees the ability to tie each recognition to a particular company value supporting D I. Access 4 mustknow tips on how to leverage recognition to boost community Use staple HR tools to monitor your progress toward becoming a more inclusive diverse company. Employee engagement software can help you better understand your organization s blind spots. Use your voice of the employee solution to measure how your workforce is feeling about current D I initiatives and gather feedback on areas to improve. If you have a recognition platform in place look at your recognition activity dashboards to immediately identify any teams or individuals that might feel underappreciated. Consider adding other typical D I KPIs like the percentage of employees belonging to minority groups average tenure of employees based on age or ethnicity etc. Measure these KPIs before and after you implement new D I initiatives to understand where you are improving and where you can do more. Building employee resource groups ERG or networks is a fantastic way for groups of people to connect at work especially at large organizations in which employees can feel disconnected. For example consider starting a women s network LGBTQ network or D I committee. Pro tip Jeff Cates CEO and President of Achievers shares 11 employee networks to consider for your company to build an inclusive culture. You can use your internal platform s features to announce these groups so employees can join to feature upcoming events or to request idea submissions. According to Jeff Cates employee networks are perhaps the single greatest way to promote the type of inclusive culture that helps people thrive and businesses stand out. Outside of ERGs think about establishing a D I steering committee that consists of employees from all areas of the business to drive and advocate for D I initiatives. Companies need to embrace D I for an improved employee experience. Ask yourself How are my employee networks and other D I initiatives guided by an overall D I strategy? As you build and grow your employee networks remember to focus on creating thoughtful conversations and strategies around D I in the workplace. It s imperative that a workplace is a safe space for everyone. Establish a culture where people feel empowered to flag situations that are alarming or even just uncomfortable. Workplaces that ensure psychological safety and trust help employees to speak up. Surveys and continuous feedback platforms give an opportunity to hear information directly from employees. Gathering honest feedback on a frequent realtime basis allows you to coursecorrect if something is awry. If you re not already try leveraging pulse surveys to regularly capture your employee s input and gather the pulse of engagement. Ask specific questions related to D I to get employees thoughts on how to build a more inclusive work environment. Be ready to take action on feedback this is critical for employees to provide feedback in the future. Show them that their voices matter. Learn how to take the pulse of employee engagement at your company Diversity needs to be part of your hiring practices. Set up diverse panels of interviewers who will select candidates based on skills and experience. Train your hiring managers on unconscious bias and what can t be asked during an interview such as aspects of a candidate s personal life or religion. Employee too should be open and conscious of biases they might bring into a meeting or oneonone session with a colleague. Consider virtual coffee chats to connect two employees at random to meet and talk about anything they want. This helps employees across various locations and departments get to know each other build meaningful relationships and create a culture of belonging. A company s policies and practices should be available to all workers at all times. The code of conduct should be updated regularly and outline the company s approach to diversity and nondiscrimination. Consider adding a nondiscrimination module into your annual employee training to reinforce its importance to the company. Other policies should clearly summarize the company s stances on compensation and benefits and employment conditions and termination.  Not only is D I a move in the right direction morally it is also smart from a recruiting and company growth standpoint. As many as 57 percent of employees believe their companies should improve diversity among the internal workforce. Furthermore an increasing body of evidence suggests that organizations that maintain their values and commitment to employees during economic hard times are the ones that continue to thrive. Today there are many tools that companies can use for D I initiatives. A great platform however tackles D I from many angles it helps support your ERGs rewards employees working on D I initiatives offers public and inclusive recognition and even infuses specific values around D I into your program. The platform should also help employees feel heard and empower managers to gather and take action on feedback especially regarding diversity and inclusion.

https://www.dayforce.com/blog/support-diversity-and-inclusion-in-the-workplace, For diversity practices to be successful you also need to facilitate an inclusive work culture. Here are some ways employers can build or improve upon their diversity equity and inclusion programs. The research that diversity in the workplace powers innovation and financial performance continues to stack up. Some studies have found that companies with pro diversity policies performed better and had greater resilience during the 2008 financial crisis. The reason for this is clear more diverse companies have greater levels of innovation. However certain industries in particular such as financial services still have significant lack of representation of people of color mainly at senior levels. Two factors contributing to this underrepresentation are the rate at which employees leave a company and the rate at which employees get promoted. As well research conducted by McKinsey has found that women in particular have been negatively impacted by the pandemic as it has intensified preexisting challenges that working women already faced such as finding childcare. LinkedIn s Global Recruiting Trends report found that diversity is a key trend that has impacted the way organizations hire their people. According to the report s findings 78 of companies prioritize diversity to improve culture and 62 of companies prioritize it to boost financial performance. And these DEI statistics couldn t be more relevant today. The report adds that companies making meaningful efforts towards diversity equity and inclusion as well as providing a sense of belonging have invested in their people through supporting employee resource groups ERGs and having a strong backing from their leadership teams. The power of diversity equity and inclusion during a crisis Making organizational change last Ways to promote diversity equity and inclusion in the workplace Taking bolder action with diversity equity and inclusion efforts Over the last year diversity and inclusion receded as a strategic priority for many organizations as they continue to address threats to business continuity and recovery. Workforces are more dispersed as some employees are working remotely while others are at or returning to the physical office or worksites. These new working arrangements can further exacerbate existing diversity challenges and highlight unconscious biases that may exist. Essentially a dispersed workforce can distance employees and teams from one another undermining inclusivity efforts and initiatives that existed in the traditional working environment. WATCH NOW Recognizing bias in the workplace How to create a more inclusive environment Recent events have sparked important conversations around racial bias and social injustice calling upon institutions and organizations to do their part in taking meaningful action. However LinkedIn data shows that companies talked about diversity back in June 2020 but that discussion began to decline just a few months later. Businesses need to take this opportunity to not only continue the conversation but to implement and uphold more impactful strategies to see real lasting change within their organization. Hiring for diverse backgrounds and promoting diversity initiatives is only a first step. Diversity equity and inclusion go handinhand and to experience real organizational change companies must build a truly inclusive work culture. This means extending initiatives beyond the hiring process and providing equal opportunity and treatment throughout every touchpoint of the employee experience. At Ceridian we define diversity as a measure of difference in identity things like gender ethnicity age sexual orientation ability or religion. Inclusion is a respect for and appreciation of these differences the deliberate act of welcoming and valuing diversity and equity. Here are some tips and action items to help managers and HR leaders build on their existing DEI efforts or develop new ones for the first time. Understanding bias and building awareness is a first step towards real change. According to Associate Dean and Director of Office of Inclusion Belonging and Intergroup Dialogue at Stanford University Mohammad Bilal there are a couple of different forms of bias. The first is unconscious bias which can include associations or feelings of bias that may be hidden underneath the surface. Bilal explained a timeless notion to the audience at INSIGHTS unconscious biases do not necessarily align with our conscious beliefs or declared beliefs which means unconscious biases are even more important to pay attention to. Leaders can start addressing this by helping employees understand how individuals are impacted by unconscious bias and what actions continue to reinforce biases. One way to build awareness and address unconscious bias is to encourage every employee to review question and analyze their own personal biases and assumptions. Bilal underscored the importance of leaders and employees keeping a thought journal to process their own biases. Recording instances of stereotyping as they occur will help people become more aware as they start to make those biases more conscious. This will help people observe when they begin to stereotype individuals so they can refute and replace biases. To learn more about unconscious biases and to assess your own you can visit Project Implicit to complete an Implicit Association Test. Cultural humility is another way leaders and employees can manage bias and foster more inclusive environments. This concept involves remaining curious and humble about cultural differences. Bilal emphasizes the importance of understanding that no one is an expert but is on a continuous learning journey when it comes to respecting and embracing other people s experiences and realities. Becoming culturally competent Bilal adds is a lifelong practice. One way organizations can help employees manage their own bias is by leveraging technology and training that provides guidance on actions for moving forward. Joelle Emerson in Harvard Business Review suggests that a concern with diversity or unconscious bias training and teaching is that people can become defensive and using technology can help alleviate that concern.  Training can be designed to reduce defensiveness by explaining that we don t have unconscious biases because we re bad people we have them because we are people she explains. The article adds that internal bias training is an effective way to inspire change and higher understanding amongst employees citing Google s internal training findings as one example. Managers must level out the playing field and provide fair opportunity for each employee. Organizations can leverage analytics to identify which employees are underpaid for similar roles or responsibilities. For example people analytics can help managers pinpoint any pay gaps that may exist within their team and leaders can assess patterns within various departments to get to the root of underlying issues. This insight can help identify patterns or trends that may exist where certain groups of employees like people of color for example are being underpaid within certain areas of the business. Diversity training helps employees understand how cultural differences can impact how people work and interact at work. It can cover anything from concepts of time and communication styles to selfidentity and dealing with conflict. Diversity training that is offered as optional tends to be more effective than that which is made mandatory. Companies should also focus on training that s relevant to their specific organization and employees and that aligns with their broader diversity equity and inclusion initiatives and identified challenges. In addition to using internal resources partnering with a consultant can help leaders build customized training programs for both the organization as a whole as well as those that are functionspecific. It s critical that leaders are clearly communicating why training is taking place problems you re trying to solve and what comes next. This will help keep people motivated and also help them understand how the learnings tie back to broader company goals. Related Diversity equity and inclusion in the workplace Five ways to make the most of your DEI initiatives One way to build awareness of diversity and foster greater inclusivity is to be aware of and acknowledge a variety of upcoming religious and cultural holidays. When closing out a team call or meeting if the audience isn t too large ask how people what their plans are to celebrate the holiday. Use your company s intranet to help employees become aware of and keep track of multicultural religious or holiday celebrations. Be respectful of these days when scheduling meetings and understand that employees have different needs that may require flexibility. In a Wall Street Journal article Rosanna Durruthy discussed leveraging employee resource groups ERGs as an opportunity to grow and develop talent and help managers learn from these groups in a safe space. ERGs help build a culture of connection and belonging. Building on this in addition to leveraging ERGs employers can make it easy for all employees to participate whether it be creating a differing pay code for easy time tracking for ERG meetings or asking employees to share initiatives or projects the ERG is focused on. Provide a toolkit or guidelines that employees can follow to encourage them to set up a new ERG. Getting senior leaders on board is also critical. An executive andor leadership sponsor can not only help to increase visibility innovation and awareness but can also help align ERG activities with business goals. Additionally commitments from senior leaders signal a wider organizational commitment to improving diversity equity and inclusion practices. Related How employers can support diversity and inclusion at work  At INSIGHTS Jacob Morgan author of The Employee Experience Advantage said a key part of diversity is understanding and learning from different voices experiences values and cultures. Morgan likened team diversity to focusing on all 64 squares in a chess game instead of getting stuck on one aspect of the board or where you happen to be playing. In the context of the workplace getting stuck is similar to focusing only on a particular geography or your own department or team. A diverse crosssection of talent allows enhanced perspective which will spur creativity on teams. If your team is homogeneous invite someone who is a different gender cultural background or age to weigh in on an initiative or project. Much has been written about how diversity in teams positively impacts creativity and innovation and the case for an inclusive culture is only growing stronger. There s value in experiences with multiple perspectives which inspires novel thinking connecting thoughts in new ways and different approaches to problemsolving. Organizations can encourage their people to share their feedback to get a better understanding of what s going on under the surface. Deploying pulse surveys across the workforce will arm leaders with the information needed to make smarter decisions and reduce or eliminate any patterns of discrimination or biases within a particular branch or area of the organization for example. Anonymous feedback via an employee pulse survey can help build a case to take immediate action on smaller more pressing issues as well as inform longterm strategies. HR leaders and managers can encourage employees to use engagement and checkin tools to facilitate conversations and transparently communicate about how they re feeling. Related Building and prioritizing a caringcentered culture Employers will also need to assess areas of the business in which discrimination can exist. Company policies and interpersonal interactions such as the way an internal issue is handled plays a key role in perpetuating existing problems. Bilal explains that a main reason why employees leave an organization is a result of poor interpersonal interactions. If employers start to rethink their policies they can address and replace negative processes or interactions with more positive ones. Leaders first need to determine whether policies enable or perpetuate discrimination in the workplace such as racism or sexism and reshape them to move towards a more equitable workplace. Policies live beyond people Bilal added.  A timeless example as noted in Ceridian s Pulse of Talent research report relates to working from home and the COVID19 pandemic. The ability to work from home was largely considered as a perk synonymous with flexibility. But after several months of remote working in crisis mode and with rapidly changing conditions the new definition of workplace flexibility and the policies that support it were due for an overhaul. And they still are today especially with regard to diversity equity and inclusion. True workplace flexibility should provide every employee with the opportunity to work fairly and equitably whether they re onsite in the office or working at home says Ceridian CHRO Susan Tohyama in the report. Facilitating flexibility for all employees she adds helps to establish a more equitable and inclusive culture across the organization. Diversity equity and inclusion efforts aren t successful overnight. In fact making structural changes to workforce strategies and systems can take many months especially as businesses face new challenges around hiring and managing their people. A cultural shift takes time which means organizations must set benchmarks and track their progress to assess how their efforts are moving the needle. This will not only show leaders what strategies are working and which ones are falling short but it will also help to hold them accountable in reaching their longterm goals. While diversity equity and inclusion are at risk during a crisis or downturn it s important for companies to recognize the key role they play in recovery resilience and overall success in the future. Effective DEI strategies will help better support employees build culture and create a thriving business. Employees will feel more engaged as they show up to work every day whether in person or online feeling safe connected and heard. Read next Tips for job seekers recruiters and leaders on cultivating a more inclusive workplace Diverse equitable and inclusive work environments also appeal to candidates as they remain highly engaged in conversations about breaking down systemic discrimination and bias and are more likely to apply to companies that are outspoken about diversity. Organizations must assess how they stack up when it comes to their DEI programs and identify areas that need to be put into even greater focus. Most importantly companies must recognize that diversity equity and inclusion is not an option or a nicetohave it s a necessity.

Harvard Business Review   Businesses are not only more successful when they embrace DEI initiatives they also are more attractive to top talent and more likely to retain them. This is especially true for millennial and Gen Z workers.  Employers that posted about diversity saw 26 more applications from women than employers who posted less. In a LinkedIn study companies with a DEI team were 22 more likely to be seen as an industryleading company with highcaliber talent and 12 more likely to be seen as an inclusive workplace for people of diverse backgrounds.  76 of employees and job seekers said diversity was important when considering job offers. 60 of employees want to hear business leaders speak up on diversity issues. 80 of survey respondents said they want to work for a company that values DEI issues.

However there is still plenty of ground to cover. Women and minorities are still underrepresented in leadership roles in particular while many employees feel their organizations aren t doing enough to support DEI initiatives.   45 of learning development professionals planned to implement DEI programs in 2022 versus 34 in 2021. A LinkedIn survey of recruiters and HR professionals found that while 69 said their organizations were committed to more diverse hiring only 47 are holding hiring managers accountable. Only 6.6 of Fortune 500 companies have women as CEOs a figure celebrated as an all time high.  The Washington Post found that of the top 50 most valuable public companies only 8 of top executives were Black. At least 8 companies employed no Black executives. Over half of employees in a Glassdoor study said their company should be doing more to increase diversity. Over 70 of Hispanic and Black employees said the same. 61 of employees in the same study said they had experienced or witnessed workplace discrimination. Only 40 of companies in a Beamery survey said they had taken DEI to the Csuite level. In the same study less than half of respondents in the U.S. agreed that our workforce should reflect the communities we serve and a diverse workforce is a competitive advantage.   Inclusive leadership is not a destination. Its a journey that requires humility curiosity and courage.   Thais Compoint Global Specialist in Inclusion and Diversity Sources Fortune Magazine Washington Post Glassdoor Beamery   How do we solve the disconnect between overwhelming evidence that DEI improves a business and the sentiment that it isn t a top priority? LinkedIn s Ty Heath suggests a transformational rather than transactive approach to the problem. Instead of making business benefit the core of a DEI initiative instead focus on how DEI can transform the business and everyone in it.   Companies that frame social issues as the right thing to do tend to be more successful at promoting desired behaviors. Recent neuroscience research also suggests that compassion is not only transformative for the human brain but it is also the key to fueling systemic cultural change. We call this making a transformational case. And the transformational case has statisticallysignificant predictive power.   Ty Heath Director Marketing Engagement The B2B Institute at LinkedIn   In other words the business case for diversity in the workplace is clear but your business is more likely to succeed if you put transformation at the center of your case for DEI.

Social gatherings and business meetings where every member must listen and have the chance to speak are good ways to create dialogues.
