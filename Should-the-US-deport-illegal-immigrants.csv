The June 2023 University of Texas Texas Politics Project poll included extensive questioning about the performance of state leaders during the 2023 Legislative session. For only the second time in UT polling but the second time in less than a year a majority of Texas voters say that the state is on the wrong track. More than half of Texans think the state is on the wrong track while border security and immigration continue to loom large especially among Texas Republicans. The latest University of TexasTexas Tribune poll has been released in full. Check out the latest poll page to explore results related to the 87th legislative session the coronavirus pandemic assessments of state leaders and more.

Camarota is the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies. The findings of this analysis show that the average cost of a deportation is much smaller than the net fiscal drain created by the average illegal immigrant. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE reported the average deportation cost as 10854 in FY 2016. In FY 2012 ICE removed 71 percent more aliens with a similar budget creating an average inflationadjusted cost of 5915. This compares to an average lifetime net fiscal drain taxes paid minus services used of 65292 for each illegal immigrant excluding their descendants. This net figure is based on fiscal estimates of immigrants by education level from the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine NAS.1 The total fiscal drain for the entire illegal population is estimated at 746.3 billion. Of course simply because deportation is much less costly than allowing illegal immigrants to stay does not settle the policy questions surrounding illegal immigration as there are many factors to consider. One argument made by opponents of immigration enforcement is that it would be prohibitively expensive to deport all illegal immigrants so we have to amnesty them.3 Advocates of enforcement argue this is a false choice as it is not necessary to deport all or even most illegal immigrants. Rather actually enforcing immigration laws would cause many illegal immigrants to return to their home countries on their own.4 It would also discourage new illegal immigrants from coming. Nonetheless the cost of deportations vs. allowing illegal immigrants to stay is still an important question. To answer that question this analysis takes the cost that Immigration and Custom Enforcement ICE estimates for the average deportation and compares it to the lifetime fiscal impact of the average illegal immigrant. We estimate two different deportation costs because ICEs immigration enforcement budgets have been relatively stable in recent years but the number of deportations has varied considerably creating very different average deportation costs. To calculate the net fiscal impact of the average illegal immigrant we take their likely education levels and apply fiscal estimates taxes paid minus costs developed by the NAS for immigrants by education level. Our findings show that deportation is much less costly than allowing illegal immigrants to stay. Of course fiscal impacts are not the only consideration when weighting the various policy options. ICEs Costs per Removal. Determining how much it costs to deport or more accurately formally remove a noncitizen from the United States is not as straightforward a question as it might seem because ICE has multiple missions and legal responsibilities. Much of what ICE does has nothing to do with immigration such as countering the smuggling of drugs and contraband across the border stopping the illegal export of sensitive technology stopping weapons trafficking preventing the production and sale of child pornography via the internet and intercepting stolen art and antiques. In short the budget of ICE is not a budget solely for immigration enforcement. In April 2017 ICE estimated that the average cost per deportation was 10854 in FY 2016. This figure includes all costs necessary to identify apprehend detain process through immigration court and remove an alien.5 Based on this description the estimate seems comprehensive including the costs for both Enforcement and Removal Operations ERO which does most of the immigration removal work and the legal division which provides the trial attorneys who prosecute removal cases via the Office of the Professional Legal Advisor OPLA. These two entities comprise the overwhelming share of spending on removals. One complicating factor when considering enforcement costs is the number of removals. ICE removed only 240255 aliens in FY 2016 compared to 409849 in FY 2012.6 However the ICE enforcement budget in 2016 was actually 7.62 percent larger than in 2012 adjusted for inflation. Yet they removed about 70.59 percent more people in 2012 than in 2016.7 Based on these numbers the average cost of a deportation in 2012 was equal to only 54.5 percent of the perremoval cost in 2016.8 Using ICEs perremoval cost figure for 2016 gives an inflationadjusted cost per removal in 2012 of 5915 10854 54.5 percent.9 If costs were what they had been in 2012 adjusted for inflation then about 200000 more aliens could have been removed for the same amount of money in 2016. The Immigration Courts. Based on the description provided by ICE the estimated removal costs do not include expenditures for the Executive Office for Immigration Review EOIR which is part of the Department of Justice.10 Though it has a few other responsibilities the overwhelming share of EOIRs workload is for removals. In FY 2016 EOIRs budget was 420.3 million and there were 240255 removals in that year which would mean that EOIRs cost per removal was 1749.11 In 2012 EIORs budget was 315389590 in 2016 dollars. If we divide this by the number of deportations in 2012 the percapita court costs were 770. Declining Number of Removals. It is certainly possible to remove significantly more people with the current budget. The government actually did so in 2012. If enforcement was stepped up it seems almost certain that the lower cost per removal would continue provided that policies continue to encourage enforcement operations rather than discourage them. During the second term of the Obama administration policies prohibiting agents from arresting aliens became increasingly stringent. A recent GAO report found that the backlog of pending cases that are carried over from the prior year in immigration court more than doubled between 2006 and 2015.12 In his analysis of the GAO report former immigration judge Andrew R. Arthur explains that several factors have caused the pace of deportations to slow.13 In addition to ICE arresting fewer aliens the number of continuances granted by the courts has ballooned and as a consequence the number of cases completed by the courts has declined. One of the biggest reasons for the recent slowdown in removals is the priorities of the Obama administration including the decision to admit so many unaccompanied minors at the border and the burden on the courts resulting from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program. The Trump administration has curtailed some of these policies. Moreover the number of arrests by ICE has increased substantially in the first few months of the new administration even though the administration has yet to implement the presidents directive to increase the ERO agent corps.14 The increase in arrests certainly demonstrates that the enforcement capacity of ICE given its current staffing levels allows for a much greater level of activity than was seen in Obamas second term. It remains to be seen if the number of removals returns to the same level as 2012. However if the costs of deportation were what they had been in 2012 then the somewhat larger enforcement budget in 2016 would have allowed for the removal of at least 200000 more aliens with the same budget. Estimating the Costs of Illegal Immigrants. There is a good deal of agreement among researchers that the education level of immigrants is a key factor in determining their net fiscal impact. As a recent study by the NAS states the education level of arriving immigrants is one of the important determinants of their fiscal impact.15 This finding is similar to a 1997 study by NAS that also examined the fiscal impact of immigrants.16 This conclusion also is mirrored by a 2013 study from the Heritage Foundation.17 Referring to the education level of household heads Heritage concluded that Welleducated households tend to be net tax contributors. But at the same time Poorly educated households whether immigrant or U.S.born receive far more in government benefits than they pay in taxes. My own research has come to the same conclusion.18 The reason for this is straightforward Those with modest levels of education tend to earn low wages in the modern American economy and as a result tend to make low tax payments and often qualify for meanstested programs. The lesseducated are a net fiscal drain on average regardless of legal status or if they were born in the United States or a foreign country. Education Levels of Illegal Immigrants. In terms of the educational attainment of illegal immigrants there is a good deal of evidence that they have modest levels of education much lower than nativeborn Americans or legal immigrants. The Heritage Foundation study cited above estimated that on average illegal immigrants have 10 years of schooling. In an earlier analysis by the Center for Immigration Studies of illegal immigrants based on 2011 Census Bureau data we found that 54 percent of adults have not completed high school 25 percent have only a high school degree and 21 percent have education beyond high school.19 The Pew Research Center estimated that 47 percent of all illegal immigrants have not completed high school 27 percent have only a high school education 10 percent have some college and 15 percent have a bachelors or more.20 We have updated our prior estimate from 2011 for adult illegal immigrants using a combined sample from the 2014 and 2015 Current Population Surveys. We find that adult illegal immigrants have become somewhat more educated since 2011 but the vast majority still have very modest levels of education. Our best estimate is that 49 percent have not graduated high school 28 percent have only a high school education 11 percent have some college 9 percent a bachelors degree and 3 percent have a graduate degree. It is also worth noting that illegal immigrants overall are significantly more educated than we reported in an earlier analysis which focused only on illegal bordercrossers.21 Illegal crossers tend to be the leasteducated component of illegal immigration because more educated foreign nationals wishing to come to the United States can often qualify for temporary visas which they can then overstay.22 The focus of this analysis is the overall illegal immigrant population which includes both visa overstayers and illegal bordercrossers. Even though illegal immigrants overall are more educated than illegal bordercrossers and illegal immigrants have become more educated over time as a group they remain much less educated than the nativeborn or legal immigrants. Fiscal Impact by Education Level. The 2016 NAS study mentioned above projected the lifetime fiscal impact taxes paid minus services used of immigrants by education. These estimates are expressed as a net present value NPV. This is a concept used in fiscal studies and in other contexts to express the sum total of costs or benefits over long periods of time in this case a lifetime. NPV represents the fiscal balance taxes paid minus costs if we had to spend the money today. Costs or benefits in the future are discounted or reduced based on how long from now they occur. Later in this report we discuss in more detail the concept of net present value both its usefulness and it shortcomings. The NAS study does not report separate estimates for illegal and legal immigrants. Rather it simply estimates tax payments and expenditures on immigrants as they appear in Census Bureau data primarily the Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement. As a result the estimates from the NAS are for both legal and illegal immigrants by education. The NAS fiscal projections include eight different scenarios each with different assumptions about future spending tax rates and the future flow of immigrants. It is not entirely clear what set of fiscal assumptions are best and the NAS study itself does not identify the one best scenario. In Table 1 we simply take all 8 scenarios and average them together by education level.  It should be pointed out that in every scenario from the NAS as shown in Table 1 immigrants without a high school education are a significant net fiscal drain during their lifetimes. That is they pay less in taxes than they use in services. Those with only a high school education are a net fiscal drain in seven of the eight scenarios. In contrast the most educated immigrants those with at least a bachelors degree are a net fiscal benefit in all eight scenarios. This is very important because the vast majority of adult illegal immigrants in the country lack a high school diploma or have only a high school education. Calculating the Fiscal Impact of Illegal Immigrants. The first column of Table 2 reports the average fiscal effect of immigrants by education level taken directly from the bottom of Table 1. Column 2 shows the education level of illegal immigrants in the country as discussed above. Column 3 multiplies the average cost by the share of illegal immigrants who fall into that educational category and the bottom of column 3 adds up the costs to give a weighted average. This means that using the NAS average fiscal costs of immigrants by education and assuming the educational distribution of illegal immigrants shown in the table the average lifetime fiscal drain is 70788 per immigrant. However for reasons discussed below we think this figure overstates the net fiscal costs.  As already mentioned the NAS fiscal analysis is for immigrants overall both legal and illegal. Although illegal immigrants do access some welfare programs and create other significant costs it should still be the case that lesseducated illegal immigrants create smaller net fiscal costs than lesseducated legal immigrants. Unfortunately the NAS study has very little discussion of how legal and illegal immigrants differ in their fiscal impact. The study does state on page 280 that unauthorized immigrants as a group may have a more positive fiscal impact than authorized immigrants. Emphasis added. We agree with their tentative conclusion and so we adjust downward the fiscal drain created by lesseducated illegal immigrants relative to illegal immigrants. To estimate the adjustment factor we use the Heritage Foundation study mentioned above. That study has estimates for immigrants by education and legal status.23 Adjusting has the effect of reducing the fiscal costs for lesseducated illegal immigrants but it also reduces the fiscal benefits for immigrants who are more educated.24 Since highly educated illegal immigrants make up only a small share of all illegal immigrants adjusting downward their positive fiscal impact has only a modest impact on the fiscal estimates. The right lower corner of Table 2 shows that the fiscal cost of an illegal immigrant once we include the adjustment is 62582. Adjusting reduces the fiscal cost by 8205. There is also the issue of inflation. The NAS fiscal estimates are reported in 2012 dollars. If we convert them to 2016 dollars so that they match the ICE 2016 deportation cost estimate then the net lifetime fiscal drain of illegal immigrants would be 65292. One way to think about the above estimates is that for every million illegal immigrants in the country there is a lifetime fiscal drain of 65.3 billion on public coffers. If we assume there are 11.43 million illegal immigrants in the country then the total fiscal costs they create during their lifetimes using the net present value concept is 746.3 billion.25 In short the savings associated with removing or causing even a modest fraction of the 11 to 12 million illegal immigrants in the country to return home would be significant. Costs Already Borne. The NAS fiscal estimates are for newly arrived immigrants during their lifetimes projected forward. Since this analysis is concerned with the existing population of illegal immigrants some share of the net fiscal costs they create has already been incurred. Based on the age of the illegal population and their time already in the United States we estimate that onefifth of their costs have already been incurred. If correct the remaining fiscal costs of illegal immigrants on average are 52234 65292 .80.26 While the full cost of illegal immigrants is important when considering deportation costs relative to fiscal costs the remaining fiscal impact of allowing illegal immigrants to remain is also an important comparison. Do Net Present Values Make Sense? The concept of net present value employed by the NAS study reduces or discounts costs or benefits in the future based on how long in the future they take place. Page 325 of the NAS study states that they used a 3 percent annual discount rate which is common in this kind of analysis. So for example the fiscal balance whether a net drain or benefit an immigrant creates two years after arrival is reduced by about 6 percent. After 10 years the amount is reduced by about 26 percent and at 20 years the discount is 45 percent. This means events that occur further in the future have a smaller impact on the total cost or benefit. Comparing the net present value fiscal costs illegal immigrants create to the costs of removal can be seen as reasonable because a removal has to be paid for up front while the fiscal drain accrues over time. By using a NPV it makes the costs of removal comparable to the lifetime costs illegal immigrants create. The primary disadvantage of using NPV for fiscal estimates is that it masks the actual size of future outlays created by lesseducated illegal immigrants. For example using a 3 percent annual discount rate as the NAS study does means that if an illegal immigrant creates a net fiscal burden of 10000 in the 23rd year of the projection only about half of this amount will be added to the total NPV. Without discounting the actual outlays associated with illegal immigrants are much larger. If the NPV concept is not used the actual net lifetime fiscal cost of illegal immigrants is likely 120000 to 130000 per illegal alien or between 1.4 and 1.5 trillion for the entire illegal population again assuming 11.43 million illegal immigrants are in the country. Including Descendants. There are four key variables in the above calculations that potentially impact the results. The first is whether to include the children of illegal immigrants. Many of the descendants of lesseducated immigrants struggle often earning low wages themselves and making use of welfare programs and other public services. If we use the NAS studys estimates that include the progeny of immigrants it adds 16998 in 2016 dollars to the net fiscal drain raising the total for the average illegal immigrant to 82290. If we assume 11.43 million illegal immigrants are in the country then the total cost of illegal immigrants and their descendants would be 940.6 billion. If the concept of net present value is not used then the costs for illegal immigrants and their children would approach 2 trillion. But the tax payments and costs created by the descendants of immigrants in the NAS study go out 75 years. Projections of this length involve significant uncertainty. Impact of Different Fiscal Assumptions. The second question is which fiscal scenario from the NAS study to use. All of the scenarios are shown in Table 1 of this report. Scenario 1 makes assumptions that are most favorable to the fiscal impact of immigrants. If we use only this scenario then the net fiscal costs created by the average illegal immigrant drop significantly to 8018 in 2016 dollars. This is somewhat less than deportation costs in 2016 and somewhat more than the cost in 2012. But this scenario assumes federal spending will not conform to historical patterns and instead that spending will be lower and tax payments higher in the future. Further this scenario assumes away costs for public goods interest payments on the national debt and other expenses. All of this seems extremely optimistic. On the other hand scenario 8 which makes the most pessimistic assumptions about the future shows a net fiscal impact for each illegal immigrant of 118091 in 2016 dollars. Averaging out all the scenarios as we do reduces the impact of extreme assumptions and provides a realistic assessment of the likely future fiscal impact of illegal immigrants. The fiscal drain varies significantly depending on which scenario is used but seven out of eight scenarios show a large negative lifetime fiscal impact for the average illegal immigrant. Illegal Immigrant Education Level. The third key assumption in our estimates is the education level of illegal immigrants. As already discussed there is widespread agreement that illegal immigrants are a relatively unskilled population. If we assume that illegal immigrants are as educated as Pew estimated the average fiscal cost would still be very large 60280 in 2016 dollars. This is very similar to our estimate of 65295. Again Pews figures show that about threequarters of illegal immigrants have less than a high school education or only a high school education and this makes them a large fiscal drain. Legal vs. Illegal Immigrants. Finally there is the question of the difference between the net fiscal impact of all immigrants legal and illegal by education level which is what the NAS estimated and the fiscal impact of illegal bordercrossers. In Table 2 we adjust the fiscal impact of illegal immigrants significantly reducing the costs of illegal immigrants relative to immigrants of the same education by almost 12 percent or 8205. If we instead used a larger discount of 50 percent for all educational categories the net fiscal costs of illegal immigrants would still be 36926 in 2016 dollars. Under a 50 percent reduction every one million illegal immigrants would still create a net fiscal drain of almost 37 billion during their lifetimes. It is important to keep in mind that mathematically any reduction in costs for lesseducated illegal immigrants means that the costs of lesseducated legal immigrants must be correspondingly higher so that they average out to the NAS estimates for all immigrants. Immigrants in the Census data used by the NAS can only be either legal or illegal. So for example we estimate that 47 percent of all immigrants in the United States who lack a high school education are in the country illegally and 53 percent are legal immigrants. The average cost estimate from the NAS study for immigrants with this education level legal and illegal is 173375 as shown in Table 1. Our estimation method as explained above reduces this amount by multiplying it by 67.6 percent a 32.4 percent reduction. As a result illegal immigrants with this education level create a lifetime fiscal drain of 117236. This means that legal immigrants who have not graduated high school must create a drain of 223159 for this to average out to the drain of 173375 from the NAS study. If we increased the discount for illegal immigrants thereby lowering their costs and multiply the NAS estimate by say 50 percent then the costs for illegal immigrants without a high school education would be 86688 a good deal less than we report. But the cost for legal immigrants without a high school education would have to grow to 250249 so that it again averages out to the overall NAS estimate of 173375 for all immigrants legal and illegal with this level of education. This drain for the leasteducated legal immigrants seems implausibly large. It is worth noting that because lesseducated legal immigrants create a larger fiscal deficit than lesseducated illegal immigrants amnesty legalization for illegal immigrants would almost certainly increase the net fiscal costs to taxpayers as illegal immigrants would become costly legal immigrants. Of course this is only true for the lesseducated illegal immigrants. The modest share of illegal immigrants who are well educated would be a significant fiscal benefit if legalized. Overall different assumptions can affect the results. But because the overwhelming share of illegal immigrants residing in the country have not completed high school or have only a high school education it would require highly implausible assumptions to avoid a substantial net fiscal drain from this population. In short illegal immigrants are a large net fiscal drain because of their education levels and this fact drives the results. Deportation on the other hand is not that costly relative to the fiscal costs illegal immigrants create. Of course there are many other factors to consider when deciding on the best course of action than just the fiscal balance between removal and allowing illegal immigrants to remain. That said deporting a large share of illegal immigrants can be justified from a fiscal point of view. 1 Francine D. Blau and Christopher Mackie eds.

USA TODAY April 28 2017. 6 FY 2016 ICE Immigration Removals Immigration and Customs Enforcement undated. 7 The 2016 ICE budget including ERO and OPLA can be found in this document on page 87. Their combined budgets in 2016 were 3498536000. The FY 2012 budget can be found here. In FY 2012 the combined costs for these entities were 3115900000 or 3250818470 adjusted to 2016 dollars. Using the combined ERO and OPLA budgets and dividing by the number of deportations would produce a higher perremoval estimate than ICE reported to USAToday. However ICE actually has detailed budget and operations figures that allow them to add up only removal costs excluding expenditures not related to deportation. This allows them to calculate the actual cost of the average deportation. 8 Calculating this percentage can be done simply by multiplying 11.7059 by 11.0762. 9 The most recent estimate from the U.S. government is that there are 11.43 million illegal immigrants in the country. Multiplying this figure by the deportation costs would create a total cost for deporting all illegal immigrants of 124.1 billion assuming a FY 2016 cost per deportation or 67.6 billion using FY 2012 deportation costs.

Such persons would be seen as intending immigrants the terminology of the U.S. consular service and the visa would be denied. As a result the overall illegal immigrant population which includes large numbers of overstayers is significantly more educated than we previously estimated for new illegal new bordercrossers. 23 The Heritage Foundation reports the average fiscal impact for illegal immigrant and legal immigrant households by education level. They also report the number of households by education and legal status. With this information it is a relatively straightforward matter to calculate the average fiscal impact of all immigrant households legal and illegal by education. We then divide this amount by the estimated costs for illegal households by education to create an adjustment factor. So for example among illegal high school dropout households the net fiscal impact is 20485 a year and for households headed by a legal immigrant who is a dropout the drain is a good deal more 36993. In Heritages estimate illegal immigrants create a net fiscal cost that is about 55 percent that of the burden created by households headed by high school dropout legal immigrants. But this is not the proper comparison as the NAS estimates are for all immigrants not just legal immigrants. Given the number of households Heritage reports the fiscal impact for all immigrant households legal and illegal headed by a dropout must be 30294. As this equals .676 of the estimated costs of illegal dropout households reported in the Heritage study this becomes the adjustment factor. We do the same for the other educational categories. As the Heritage study does not show separate estimates for those with only a bachelors degree and those with a graduate education we use the same adjustment factor for both. Taken together this approach reduces the net fiscal drain of illegal immigrants by almost 12 percent. 24 This reflects the fact that while higherskilled illegal immigrants are assumed to create a fiscal surplus they often are unable to find work commensurate with their education level because of their legal status and so have to work at lowerpaying jobs. They are also more likely to be paid under the table by their employers reducing their tax contributions relative to their legal counterparts. As a result they do not have as large a positive impact on public coffers as highskilled legal immigrants. 25 The most recent government estimate of the illegal immigrant population is 11.43 million. See Bryan Baker and Nancy Rytia Estimates of the Unauthorized Immigrant Population Residing in the United States January 2012 Department of Homeland Security March 2013. 26 The biggest limitation of this approach is that the NAS report does not include detailed fiscal balances by years in the United States and education making it difficult to know what share of the costs has already been incurred. Table 811 on page 338 of the study reports mortality and emigration assumptions. We do not change these.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/01/24/why-trumps-deportation-plan-for-undocumented-immigrants-is-not-doable/, Increasingly it appears that Donald Trump will be the Republican candidate in the upcoming Presidential election probably facing President Biden for a second round. Once again immigration appears to be one of the key issues in the campaign. In the 2016 election President Trump promised to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and have Mexico pay for it. That did not happen. This time Trump promises to arrest and deport millions of undocumented immigrants living in the United States. The question arises whether that is even doable. But before we can deal with the immigration question we have to ask whether Donald Trump will even be reelected given the challenges he faces. To be sure there are critical challenges. Trump faces over 90 criminal charges for his conduct before and after his defeat in 2020. Perhaps the most serious charges arose from his attempts to stop the counting of Electoral College votes following the 2020 Presidential election including sending his supporters to Capitol Hill to storm Congress. In that instance alone five people lost their lives and over 100 people were injured while Trump refused to call off his supporters who were rampaging in the Capitol Building for several hours. Charges related to Trumps failure to turn over classified documents in some cases even top secret ones taken from the White House his refusal to return those documents when asked to do so and his pressuring state officials to falsify election results are also very serious. If convicted of any one of these charges Trump could be sent to jail. It remains an open question whether a conviction will have any impact on his capacity to win the upcoming Presidential election. Nikki Haley is also running for the Republican leadership Photo by Scott OlsonGetty Images At least in part his popularity can be explained by his ability to portray himself as the Washington outsider who can tap into the anger and frustration of singleissue voting groups. These include those who stand for the right to life the second amendment right to bear arms supporters white supremacists antivaxxers evangelicals and anti LGBTQ and immigrant advocates. The perception of his followers is that he is better able to handle the economy and as a businessman knows how to run the government more effectively. However Trump and his MAGA followers represent the far right wing of his party and are out of touch with the Republicanism of former great leaders like Lincoln Eisenhower and Reagan. Amazingly Trump has managed to persuade most of his followers that he indeed won the 2020 Presidential election when he didn t. They still believe his claim of a stolen election despite the fact that he lost 60 lawsuits in courtrooms all over America that held that he did actually lose the election to Biden. But most important of all as Liz Cheney in her book Oath and Honor documents Trump has used coercive tactics including harassment intimidation and the use of violence against those who oppose him including government officials and Republican leaders. Not even President Eisenhowers Operation Wetback came close to what Trump is proposing. Photo by ... Hulton ArchiveGetty Images That said let s return to Trump s number one promise to detain and deport millions of undocumented immigrants. While some previous Presidents have tried to deport unlawful immigrants from the USA none came anywhere close to expelling as many as Trump is proposing. Not even President Eisenhower who implemented Operation Wetback came close to what Trump is proposing. A reelected President Trump would soon discover that the task of removing illegal immigrants is more difficult than it seems. Even illegal immigrants in America have certain constitutional rights particularly those who have been here for longer periods of time. For example longer term illegal immigrants are entitled to the right to counsel albeit at their own expense. They are also protected by at least the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment rights to due process. Illegal immigrants also have other legal protections. These constitutional rights mean that to remove illegal immigrants from America would require legal hearings in courtrooms. In addition to considering the rights of the defendants this would create a logistical nightmare tying up the courts from dealing with other substantive issues. Judges prosecutors defense counsel as well as the persons concerned would all have to coordinate their calendars to schedule mutually agreeable dates for hearings before illegal immigrants could be deported. If you multiply this by some millions of cases you have a better idea of why legally removing these immigrants from America is going to take a long time and will be very expensive. Undocumented immigrants want to stay Photo by Joe SohmVisions of AmericaUniversal Images Group ... via Getty Images Of all the illegal immigrants in America far less than one million have criminal records. Assuming the criminal group would be dealt with by President Trumps deportation efforts as a priority that leaves as many as 10 million who would not be subject to criminal expedited processing. What is more twothirds of this estimated 10 million or some six million people have been in this country illegally as immigrants for over 10 years. We are talking about those immigrants who apart from their immigration status live normal decent lives and who have families and jobs in the United States and who for years have been contributing to America through their work and taxes. This would also affect the children born in America to these immigrants who would thereby be American citizens. What do you do about them? Trump s plan to deport millions of undocumented immigrants residing in America is a mission impossible. Unless America allows Trump to become a dictator and to throw aside the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law his plan cannot succeed. Trump has hinted that is the direction he is headed. It is up to the courts and ultimately up to the American electorate to decide whether they want their democracy to prevail or for America to become a dictatorship under Trump.

CLANDESTINO the European Unionfunded project tasked with providing data on unauthorized migration was terminated. The project s database coordinators may update the CLANDESTINO site.  While the statistics for the United States and Turkey only include illegal immigration the 12 other countries listed measure irregular immigration which combines people living in the country illegally with people working in the country illegally whether they are legal residents.  Irregular immigration is a term used by the organization CLANDESTINO which is the European Unionfunded multination consortium designed to provide data on unauthorized migration to EU members. The term includes what people in the United States largely consider illegal immigration 1. Seemingly regular registered foreign nationals with falsified papers 2. Children without resident status 3. Aged family members without resident status 4. Unemployed foreign national without resident status and 5. Foreign nationals without residence status in regular taxpaying jobs. Irregular immigration also includes people who reside in the country legally or illegally and who are working illegally 6. Tourists from non EU countries in irregular unregistered jobs 7. Foreign nationals without residence status working in irregular unregistered jobs 8. Foreign nationals with residence status and without work permission in irregular unregistered jobs and 9. Foreign nationals with residence status and work permission in irregular unregistered jobs.  Because the irregular immigration statistics include illegal immigration and for purposes of roughly comparing the United States to other nations we have shown illegal immigration statistics alongside irregular immigration statistics. All estimates are rough estimates and each country may count estimate or calculate the numbers using different methods. Some countries have different sources for different years which may account for some unusual variation.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2015/08/24/what-americans-want-to-do-about-illegal-immigration/, A gap in the fence near the U.S.Mexico border overlooking Tijuana Mexico in 2014. Photo by Charles OmmanneyReportage by Getty ImagesThe debate over the future of the nation s estimated 11.3 million unauthorized immigrants is on the political front burner once more. President Barack Obama set the stage in November when he announced new executive actions now tied up in court to prevent the deportation of millions of unauthorized immigrants expanding 2012 s original program aimed mostly at providing relief to those brought to the United States as children. Illegal immigration has dominated the Republican presidential campaign particularly after Donald Trump s call for deporting all undocumented immigrants in the U.S. and building a wall along the U.S.Mexico border. Others have called for a changing the constitutional amendment that guarantees birthright citizenship. Among the public overall there is little support for an effort to deport all those in the U.S. illegally but surveys in past years have found greater support for building a barrier along the Mexican border and for changing the Constitution to ban birthright citizenship. Republicans have long been conflicted over U.S. immigration policy. On the one hand consistent majorities of Republicans favor providing a path to legal status for people in the U.S. illegally. Yet most Republicans also worry that granting legal status to undocumented immigrants would amount to a tacit reward for illegal behavior. And in the past nearly half of Republicans supported changing the Constitution to bar birthright citizenship and a majority supported building a fence along the entire U.S. border with Mexico. Here s a breakdown of public opinion on some key immigration issues Stay or deport? In a Pew Research Center survey conducted in May a solid majority 72 of Americans including 80 of Democrats 76 of independents and 56 of Republicans say undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. should be allowed to stay in this country legally if they meet certain requirements. Last year we asked a followup question of those who opposed granting legal status to undocumented immigrants Should there be a national law enforcement effort to deport all immigrants here illegally? Just 17 of the public overall favored such an effort including about a quarter 27 of Republicans. Moreover in a 2013 survey 76 of Republicans said that deporting all immigrants in the U.S. illegally was unrealistic.  One measure of public sentiment is how Americans have felt about the record number of deportations of unauthorized immigrants during the Obama administration and an early2014 survey found the public was divided. Overall 45 of Americans called the increase in such deportations a good thing and the same share said it was a bad thing. Republicans 55 good thing especially Republicans and Republican leaners who agree with the Tea Party 65 were more likely than Democrats 37 to have a positive view of increased deportations. A majority 60 of Hispanics saw the increase in deportations as a bad thing. In another survey of Latino adults in 2013 nearly half 46 said they worry a lot or some that they a family member or a close friend could be deported. And 56 said it was more important for undocumented immigrants to be able to work and live in the U.S. without the threat of deportation than to obtain a pathway to citizenship according to our 2014 poll. Birthright citizenship One of the proposals raised in the current Republican presidential campaign is whether to change the U.S. Constitution s 14th Amendment which states All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. On that issue a majority of Americans 57 in February 2011 said that the Constitution should remain as it is allowing any child born in the U.S. full citizenship 39 favored changing the Constitution to bar birthright citizenship. Also we found that 87 of Americans were aware of this birthright. At that time the idea of ending birthright citizenship drew broad opposition among Hispanics 73 young people 73 of those under 30 and Democrats 66. However Republicans were divided 49 wanted to leave the Constitution as it is while 47 favored a constitutional amendment to bar birthright citizenship. In 2012 at least 4.5 million U.S.born children lived with at least one unauthorized parent according to our analysis. Some 4 million unauthorized immigrant adults lived with their U.S.born children. Build a wall or a fence Our most recent survey on this issue was in October 2011. At that time 46 favored building a fence along the entire border with Mexico while 47 were opposed. Republicans 62 were far more likely than independents 44 or Democrats 39 to support the construction of a border fence. Overall views of immigrants Views about immigration policies are often shaped by views about immigrants themselves Are immigrants generally a problem taking jobs and services or do they strengthen the country through hard work and talents? In our May survey about half of Americans 51 say immigrants strengthen the country while 41 view them as a burden. These opinions have fluctuated over the years but in the mid1990s majorities said immigrants to the U.S. were a burden. However Republicans 63 are far more likely than Democrats 32 to say immigrants are a burden. And the share of Republicans who regard immigrants as a burden jumped 15 percentage points from 48 in March 2014. Declining immigration The latest immigration debate comes against a backdrop in which the number of unauthorized immigrants coming to the U.S. has leveled off. That number peaked in 2007 especially for those from Mexico. As growth of this group has stalled there has been a recent sharp rise in the median length of time that unauthorized immigrants have lived in the U.S. In 2013 unauthorized immigrant adults had been in the U.S. for a median time of nearly 13 years meaning that half had been in the country at least that long according to a preliminary estimate. A decade earlier in 2003 the median for adults was less than eight years. Despite the renewed focus on immigration it s worth keeping in mind that immigration has not ranked high in our annual poll on the issues Americans see as a top priority for the president and Congress. Even among Hispanics immigration has not been a top priority a 2014 survey found that Hispanics rated education 92 jobs and the economy 91 and health care 86 as extremely or very important issues but fewer said the same about immigration 73.

https://cmsny.org/publications/mass-deportations-impoverish-us-families-create-immense-costs/, DOWNLOAD PDF ENGLISH This paper provides a statistical portrait of the US undocumented population with an emphasis on the social and economic condition of mixedstatus households that is households that contain a US citizen and an undocumented resident. It is based primarily on data compiled by the Center for Migration Studies CMS. Major findings include the following Based on this profile a massive deportation program can be expected to have the following major consequences CMS derived its population estimates for 2014 using a series of statistical procedures that involved the analysis of data collected by the US Census Bureau s American Community Survey ACS. The privacy of all respondents in the survey is legally mandated and for the reasons listed in the Appendix the identity of undocumented residents cannot be derived from the data. A detailed description of the methodology used to develop the estimates is available at the CMS website.2 This paper provides a demographic analysis of the potential impact on US families and children of largescale deportation of US undocumented residents. During his candidacy President Trump vowed to deport all 11 million US undocumented residents. After the election he seemed to moderate his position pledging to deport two to three million undocumented criminals a wildly exaggerated number to complete 2000 miles of walls and fencing along the USMexico border and after the immigration situation normalized to determine what to do about the terrific and great people without status. If President Trump no longer intends to try to deport all 11 million undocumented residents it would be a positive development. A program to legalize a large percentage of the undocumented would make even more sense. Yet Trump has never disavowed his earlier pledge to deport 11 million persons and in a January 25 executive order set exceedingly broad enforcement priorities and vowed to ensure the faithful execution of the immigration laws against all removable aliens. In addition he may yet rescind and certainly does not seem poised to extend the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program3 much less commit to a legalization program. The paper details the characteristics of US undocumented residents and how their removal would affect US families primarily mixedstatus families and the children both US citizen and undocumented in these families. In addition it summarizes the likely negative effects of a mass removal program on the housing market and on US gross domestic product GDP.4 As a result of the relatively low numbers of arrivals in recent years the length of residence of the undocumented population continues to increase. In 2014 62 percent had lived in the United States for 10 years or more and that rate will continue to rise as long as arrivals remain at relatively low levels. Of course longer residence leads to increasing ties with the US population including increasing numbers of USborn children. In this section we begin with a description of the total undocumented population and then shift the focus to mixedstatus households that is households with at least one US citizen and one undocumented resident. Mixedstatus households are emphasized primarily because the possibility of deportation and its attendant social and economic disruptions can generate immense hardship for millions of US citizen residents who are entitled to a level of security and opportunity consistent with their rights as citizens. Referring to the undocumented population with a single number 11 million raises the specter of a large unknown and frightening group of people who are sometimes referred to as living in the shadows. However the portrait becomes more familiar upon closer examination. For example of the 5.3 million households with undocumented residents 2.8 million or 53 percent are home to 5.7 million USborn children.5 Of the 7.6 million undocumented residents in the labor force threequarters of a million are selfemployed having created their own jobs and in the process creating jobs for many others. About 1.4 million undocumented persons carpool three times the rate of nativeborn residents. A total of 1.3 million or 13 percent of those over age 18 have college degrees. Of those two thirds or 855000 have degrees in four fields engineering business communications and social sciences. Of the 11 million undocumented residents six million or 55 percent speak English well very well or only English. About 66 percent have access to the internet. By many of these measures a sizeable proportion of the undocumented residents are indistinguishable from the general population. Economically undocumented residents were doing reasonably well in 2014 Finally it should be noted that 2.9 million or 27 percent of this population did not choose to be undocumented. They arrived with their parents when they were less than 15 years of age. The examination of mixedstatus households allows us to measure some of the possible negative consequences for US citizens who live with the possibility that any day an undocumented resident in the household could be apprehended detained and deported. The fear of deportation looms largest but there are other factors that can impact the wellbeing of US citizens in these households. For example parents with undocumented status may be reluctant to attend meetings at their children s schools or to apply for benefits to which their children are legally entitled. Household income is likely to be reduced when undocumented residents do not seek better jobs or fail to petition for better wages and working conditions for fear of retaliatory firings. The US undocumented population can be divided into two groups 1 those who live in households with US citizens and 2 those who do not. In 2014 there were a total of 5.3 million households with undocumented residents and US citizens lived in just over 3.3 million of them. We examined the characteristics of both types of households. The percent for households with US citizens is listed first in the bullets below. Undocumented residents who live in households with US citizens It might be surprising that undocumented residents who share households with US citizens generally do less well economically than households without any US citizens. However more of the former live in poverty their unemployment rate is slightly higher and they are less likely to have health insurance coverage. In 2014 about 5.7 million USborn children under age 18 lived in households with undocumented residents outnumbering the 1.1 million undocumented children in those households by a ratio of 5 to 1. In addition to fear that their parents could be deported and the family divided the 5.7 million US citizens living in households with undocumented residents face the possibility that their household s income could fall sharply if a parent or other worker in the household were deported. To determine the effects of that eventuality we first compiled the median income of households with a mix of undocumented residents and US citizens. Then we recomputed the median household income but omitted the income of undocumented residents. The median household income fell from 41300 to 22000 a drop of 19300 or 47 percent and below the 2016 federal poverty line of 24300 for a family of four. Repeating the exercise but focusing on family units median income fell from 36000 to 18000 a drop of 50 percent. These findings underlie how important it is to the security and wellbeing of 5.7 million US citizen children that their families remain intact and that their parents be able to secure legal status. The previous discussion described the characteristics of US undocumented residents and discussed the effects of their deportation on US citizen children and other household members. This section focuses exclusively on the US citizens themselves in households with at least one undocumented resident. In 2014 a total of 6.6 million7 US citizens were living in households with undocumented residents. Of those about 5.7 million were under age 18 and 865000 were age 18 and over. An unknown number of USborn children of undocumented residents are adults who do not live in households with their parents. There are only a few characteristics that permit comparisons between the total undocumented population and the US citizens who live in households with undocumented residents. The percent or number for US citizens is listed first. As shown in Table 1 removing the undocumented residents from these households and thus reducing median income by 50 percent could reduce the amount of financial support available to their USborn children remaining in the United States by a total of 118 billion.  The consequences of mass deportation would not be limited to legal household members and the USborn children of undocumented residents. There would be nationwide repercussions. For example the adverse effects would likely spill over into the entire US housing market about 1.2 million or 23 percent of the 5.3 million households that have undocumented residents have mortgages.10 In a recent study of the relationship between deportations and foreclosures Rugh and Hall 2016 found that unauthorized status leads to a chain of events from deportation lost household income foreclosure and ultimately lost wealth. Their analysis is the first to propose and detect the effect of immigrant deportations on Latino foreclosures. The primary findings were that deportations exacerbate rates of foreclosure among Latinos by removing income earners from owneroccupied households and local immigration enforcement plays an important role in understanding why Latinos experienced foreclosures most often.  Mass deportation would have a major negative effect on the national economy. Edwards and Ortega 2016 used CMS estimates of the US undocumented resident population along with other data to project the nationwide impact of a mass deportation program. They concluded that a policy of mass deportation would immediately reduce the nation s GDP by 1.4 percent and ultimately by 2.6 percent and reduce cumulative GDP over 10 years by 4.7 trillion.  This report demonstrates that the social and economic status of millions of US citizens would be substantially jeopardized by a massive deportation program. Deportation of undocumented residents in mixedstatus households would decrease household income by about 50 percent. In addition if just onethird of the USborn children remained in the United States after their parents were deported the total financial burden of raising the children would be 118 billion. Mass deportation would also result in high default rates for the 1.2 million mortgages held by households with undocumented immigrants and as a result would undermine the US housing market. In addition according to one study the nation s GDP would be reduced by an estimated 4.7 trillion over 10 years. Authors Rugh and Hall 2016 conclude their study of the effects of deportations on the housing market on a cautionary note which is consistent with the analysis set forth in this paper As the country prepares for the possibility of increased enforcement and mass deportations the lessons learned from this analysis take on new meaning and have increased relevance. Policymakers and advocates would be wise to consider the widereaching repercussions of enforcement for individuals families and communities both in the short and long terms. In these circumstances the paper s overarching policy recommendation is to keep mixedstatus US families intact whether through executive action or far better a legalization program for their undocumented members. 1 Source National Conference of State Legislatures National Monthly Employment Update data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. httpwww.ncsl.orgresearchlaborandemploymentnationalemploymentmonthlyupdate.aspx. 2 Go to httpdata.cmsny.orgabout.html. 3 DACA is a quasilegalization program established in June 2012 that provides a temporary reprieve from removal and employment authorization to certain undocumented residents who arrived as children. The DACAeligible have extensive and longstanding ties to the United States Kerwin and Warren 2016. 4 Gross domestic product GDP is the value of all finished goods and services produced in a specified period. 5 The figure of 6.6 million includes only the USborn of any age who lived in households with undocumented residents in 2014. USborn children of undocumented parents who have established separate households that do not include undocumented residents could not be estimated and so are not included in the 6.6 million figure. 6 Source National Conference of State Legislatures National Monthly Employment Update data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. httpwww.ncsl.orgresearchlaborandemploymentnationalemploymentmonthlyupdate.aspx. 7 The figure of 6.6 million exceeds the 5.7 million number cited elsewhere because it includes nearly a million adult US citizens who live in households with undocumented residents. In some cases it might include US citizens who live in these households but are unrelated to the undocumented residents. 8 This adjustment takes into account the varying ages of the USborn children. First we computed the median age of the children who live in households with undocumented residents which was 8.0 years. That means that on average 9.0 years of additional childrearing would be needed for each child. Item 2 in Table 1 was computed as follows 9.0 divided by 17.0 years 52.9 percent. 9 This assumes that half of the financial support of USborn children of undocumented residents is being provided by undocumented residents and the rest by legal residents. This is a conservative estimate that has the effect of reducing the final estimate. 10 In the 3.3 million mixedstatus households about 900000 or about 26 percent of the mortgages would be at risk.

Credit Handout via REUTERS Sign up for The Brief The Texas Tribune s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. The Mexican government on Wednesday responded to the Texas Legislature s passage of Senate Bill 4 which creates a state crime for entering the state illegally from Mexico and allows state and local authorities to deport undocumented immigrants saying it categorically rejects Texas latest proposal to arrest and deport immigrants to Mexico.  The Government of Mexico reiterates its rejection of any measure that contemplates the involuntary return of migrants without respect for due process says the statement from Mexico s secretary of foreign relations. It added that Mexico recognizes the sovereign right of any country to decide the public policies that should be implemented in its territory but Mexico also has a right to defend the estimated 10 million people of Mexican origin in Texas and establish its own immigration policies in its territory.   The Government of Mexico categorically rejects any measure that allows state or local authorities to detain and return nationals or foreigners to Mexican territory the statement says. The statement did not explicitly say that Mexico would refuse to accept migrants removed from Texas under SB 4 which has passed both chambers of the Legislature and will become law if Gov. Greg Abbott signs the bill. On Wednesday morning Abbott said on social media that he looks forward to signing Senate Bill 4.  In its statement Mexico said it has ordered its consulates in Texas to provide information to Mexican citizens about their rights and the details of SB 4. The statement added that Mexico will continue to work with the U.S. federal government regarding immigration matters. On Tuesday evening the Texas House approved SB 4 which would make it a state misdemeanor to illegally cross the border from Mexico into Texas empower Texas peace officers to arrest undocumented immigrants and require that a state judge order the person to leave the U.S. to Mexico in lieu of prosecution. The charge could be enhanced to a felony if the migrant is accused of other crimes or refuses to comply with a judge s order to return to Mexico. The bill also allows immigrants to present evidence that they are in the country legally during the prosecution. The maximum penalty for a misdemeanor charge is a year in jail for a felony the penalty is two to 20 years in prison. The Texas Tribune previously interviewed lawyers professors and a former chief of the National Immigration Institute the Mexico s immigration regulatory office who said Mexico is under no obligation to accept nonMexican nationals from Texas. Mexico has agreements in place with the U.S. government to accept Mexican citizens and migrants from certain other countries when they are deported and the sources said it would be unprecedented for Mexico to create a diplomatic relationship with a U.S. state over immigration matters. Many of the immigrants entering the U.S. are not from Mexico according to government data. In fiscal year 2023 which ended on Sept. 30 about 83 of the 1 million immigrants encountered by Border Patrol on the TexasMexico border were not Mexican citizens. Many are coming from Central and South America Asia or Eastern European countries. Some are also from Canada. It s already illegal under federal law to cross the U.S.Mexico border between ports of entry. Immigrants who violate the law can be criminally charged and put into deportation proceedings. A person who enters the country regardless of whether they did it legally or illegally has up to a year to apply for asylum. In Texas a majority of Democratic lawmakers at least one Republican senator and civil rights organizations say that SB 4 is unconstitutional because the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled immigration laws can only be enforced by the federal government. During debate over the bill Democrats warned that it could lead to civil rights violations against both immigrants and U.S. citizens who may not have their papers handy when stopped by the police. In a landmark 2012 case Arizona v U.S. the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that local police didn t have the authority to arrest someone solely based on their immigration status and that responsibility falls to the federal government. During a debate in the state Senate last week Sen. Brian Birdwell RGranbury who sponsored a similar proposal during a previous special session that would have required the state to turn arrested migrants over to federal immigration officials rather than deporting them criticized SB 4.  We are setting a terrible precedent for the future by invalidating our obedience and faithfulness to our Constitution Birdwell said before referring to a frequent Republican criticism that President Joe Biden has failed to secure the southern border. President Biden s failure to obey his oath does not compel us to violate ours.   Independent Texas reporting needs your support.

https://immigration.procon.org/,  Path to citizenship is a political phrase that usually refers to allowing undocumented immigrants to become American citizens via a special process. This process may include special requirements such as fees background checks or additional waiting times beyond those already in place for the naturalization of documented immigrants. Citizenship means the immigrants could receive government benefits such as Social Security would be eligible to vote could bring family members into the U.S. and would not be deported for committing a crime.  The term legalization refers to a different process from a path to citizenship. Legalization means undocumented immigrants would be allowed to remain in the country legally but would not be allowed to become citizens or receive the same rights granted to US citizens. With legalization the immigrants would be authorized to work in the U.S. have the ability to legally travel in and out of the country and would not be subject to deportation for being in the country though committing certain crimes could lead to deportation. They would not be eligible to vote or to receive government benefits or to bring family members into the country. Read more history  Undocumented immigrants are our friends neighbors relatives and colleagues it is in America s interest to find a reasonable solution for this population. An earned pathway to citizenship with restitution allows them to fully assimilate and integrate into the United States without being unfair to others argued Laura Collins Director of the Bush InstituteSMU Economic Growth Initiative at the George W. Bush Institute. 35 These undocumented immigrants and their families are already engrained in our country. According to a 2021 George W. Bush Presidential Center white paper approximately twothirds of them have been in the US for over a decade. 1.6 million were married to US citizens in 2018 and 675000 were married to lawful permanent residents. 4.4 million American children citizens and another 100000 lawful permanent resident or nonimmigrant children had at least one undocumented parent. 35 36 95.8 of undocumented immigrants were employed in 2018 contributing a total of 20.1 billion in federal income taxes and 11.8 billion in state and local taxes. In doing so they created a 100 billion surplus in the Social Security program between 2004 and 2014 and a 35.1 billion surplus in the Medicare Trust Fund between 2000 and 2011. In other words though they created these surpluses for the country through the automatic payroll taxes they pay they still were denied the benefits that other taxpayers receive. 37 According to the Center for American Progress a fiveyear path to citizenship for all undocumented immigrants would offer significant results after five years 32.4 14000 increase in annual wages for undocumented workers 1.1 700 increase in all other workers annual wages 438800 new jobs and a 1.7 trillion increase in the total cumulative GDP gross domestic product. 38 As economics professor Giovanni Peri and doctoral student Reem Zaiour of have argued Undocumented immigrants have long been essential to the nation s economic growth and prosperity. As the country battled the coronavirus pandemic and economic fallout over the past year the role of undocumented immigrants ensured the wellbeing and safety of all Americans Nearly 3 in 4 undocumented individuals in the workforce an estimated 5 million are essential workers. At great risk to themselves and their families these individuals keep food supply chains running care for patients in hospitals and support medical systems maintain the country s roads and buildings provide critical care and services for children and the elderly and educate future generations of Americans. All are critical members of the human infrastructure that powers the nation each day . Legalization and a pathway to citizenship would provide the necessary relief and security for undocumented families and would bring a muchneeded boost to the U.S. economy. 38 As President Barack Obama explained These are young people who study in our schools they play in our neighborhoods they re friends with our kids they pledge allegiance to our flag. They are Americans in their heart in their minds in every single way but one on paper. They were brought to this country by their parents sometimes even as infants and often have no idea that they re undocumented until they apply for a job or a driver s license or a college scholarship. 39 Called Dreamers for the failed DREAM Act legislation there are between 1159000 and 3600000 undocumented immigrants in the United States who arrived as minors. 611470 of those immigrants were registered for DACA as of Dec. 2021. While most Dreamers are from Mexico they hail from at least 150 countries including China Poland India and Nigeria. 40 41 42 According to Mar. 2021 fwd.us estimates 76 of Dreamers entered the United States in 2011 or earlier and 71 entered the U.S. before they turned 13 years old with the average Dreamer arriving at age seven. Over 400000 Dreamers are now a parent to a U.S. citizen child. 50 or more Dreamers are essential workers. 41 43 44  Over the next 10 years Dreamers who currently have DACA will contribute an estimated 433.4 billion to the GDP 60 billion in fiscal impact and 12.3 billion in taxes to Social Security and Medicare estimated Laurence Benenson Vice President of Policy Advocacy of the National Immigration Forum. 42 DACA households paid 6.2 billion in federal and 3.3 billion in state and local taxes annually. They command 25.3 billion in spending power own 68000 homes with 760 million in mortgage payments and pay 2.5 billion in rent yearly. 44 As education journalist Richard Barth concludes Dreamers are showing us every day how committed they are to this country. We need them to help us build a stronger better future together. That means creating a path for them to become citizens as soon as we possibly can. 45  For too many years the conversation has been predicated on a false dichotomy that says America can either honor its history and traditions as a nation of immigrants or live up to its ideals as a nation of laws by enforcing the current immigration system . The fundamental problem with this debate is that America is and has always been both a nation of immigrants and a nation of laws . Indeed it is precisely because these two visions of the country are intertwined that America cannot be a nation of laws if those laws are antithetical to its history and ideals as a nation of immigrants argues Tom Jawetz Vice President of Immigration Policy at the Center for American Progress 46 Jawetz concludes because the legal immigration system for many years has provided inadequate opportunities for people looking to come to the United States or remain here an extralegal system has evolved that consists of both unauthorized migration itself and formal and informal policies to not disrupt a generally mutually beneficial arrangement . Restoring the rule of law requires extending a path to citizenship for the broader undocumented population. 46 American immigration law has not been updated to deal with the reality of modern illegal immigration. For example almost half of the undocumented immigrants in the US did not circumvent the Southern border wall they overstayed their legal visas. 47 Kalpana Peddibhotla immigration lawyer explains They entered with a specific purpose and fell out of status for a variety of reasons only to realize there is no easy mechanism to correct their status violations . They stay because they built their lives here bought homes here had children here. 47 The legal immigration system is far too restrictive preventing those who want to immigrate legally from doing so because they d have to wait in line for decades immigrants without higher education are limited despite those immigrants fueling the US economy and immigrants need an American sponsor to even apply among a litany of other defects in the laws. 48 Current immigration laws are broken and do not reflect American values as a nation of immigrants. The laws have encouraged the arrival or overstay of undocumented immigrants without offering a path to reconcile their status with the law. 48 If immigrants can skip the citizenship or legalization line by crossing the border without permission or overstaying legal entry why would they bother with the appropriately lengthy legal process? Amnesty effectively incentivizes immigrants to break the law with a large reward. 49 50 51 Calling amnesty the worst approach to illegal immigration Matt O Brien Director of Research at the Federation for American Immigration Reform FAIR says amnesty for illegal aliens is a slippery slope. As any parent school teacher or police officer knows rewarding bad behavior only encourages more bad behavior. And much of our current immigration situation is directly attributable to the series of amnesties that began with the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 IRCA.

Ultimately amnesty unfairly favors those who have broken U.S. laws at the expense of those who obey them. 54 The United States already has a path to citizenship. The country has laws that clearly state who may enter the country for what reasons and under what circumstances and by what process they may become US citizens. 55 The United States also already has a penalty for people who break those laws. The penalty for unlawful presence is deportation and a three or tenyear time bar for legal reentry. For repeat violations immigrants may be permanently barred from the United States. 56 57 Though difficult to accurately count the Department of Homeland Security estimated 11.4 million undocumented immigrants in the US in 2018. According to Migration Policy Institute estimates there were about 11 million in 2019. The Center for Immigration Studies estimated 11.35 million in 2022. 58 59 60 Of those undocumented immigrants only 320000 migrants have Temporary Protected Status TPS with the potential for 588335 others to gain that status depending upon Biden Administration classifications for their home countries. TPS is a temporary immigration status provided to nationals of certain countries experiencing problems that make it difficult or unsafe for their nationals to be deported to those countries. 61 62 Those numbers do not include the 29916 refugees or 46508 people granted asylum either via prearrival application or asking for asylum at the border upon undocumented arrival in 2019. 63 Even with rough estimates that leaves over 10 million undocumented immigrants without legal permission to be in the country. In what other situation does the United States look the other way about 10 million instances of broken laws? 55 As indicated by the 1986 IRCA any kind of amnesty only deals with the immediate issue the undocumented immigrants in the country at that time and does nothing to resolve the ongoing illegal immigration problem. 64 The United States needs to enforce the laws on the books send a clear noentry message to other immigrants who may try to enter the country illegally in the future and restore the country s image as one of laws. 64 Offering a legal status without the possibility of citizenship would address the reality of the American illegal immigration problem with a workable solution. More than 10 million undocumented immigrants live in the United States without TPS Temporary Protected Status a number that is impossible to locate and process for either deportation or other legal action. 61 65 As Dr. Ashley Nunes a research scientist at Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Center for Transportation and Logistics argues A more pragmatic solution would be to offer a path to legalization that stops short of citizenship. That would meet the humanitarian imperative to keep families together. But it would also hold those who have violated immigration laws accountable for their actions . Except for those who were born on American soil citizenship is not a right. It s a privilege. A path short of citizenship sends a powerful message to America s legalimmigrant community whose members have worked tirelessly to follow existing immigration guidelines. There is a rule of law and citizenship is granted to those who follow it. 66 One option suggested by the libertarian Cato Institute is a tiered legalization process. Undocumented immigrants would have the ability to pay a fee to obtain a work permit that requires a feebased renewal allowing them to work and live in the US legally travel abroad and return to the US and otherwise legally participate in American society. They would not be able to vote access welfare or other entitlements or apply for citizenship. Most undocumented immigrants would choose this path instead of a more expensive path to citizenship based on data from the IRCA. 65 Another option is rolling legalization. Undocumented immigrants who have been in the country for more than 10 years could apply for legalization without a path to citizenship and immigration enforcement would only deport more recently arrived immigrants. Law enforcement could then more efficiently target a smaller population while sending a message to potential immigrants that American laws will be enforced. 65 Immigration policies like these would promote legal immigration and confront the reality of a large undocumented population while not rewarding illegal activity that could promote still more illegal crossings or overstays. 65 ProConEncyclopaedia Britannica Inc.325 N.
