https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/feb/14/americans-believe-climate-change-study, Denialism highest in central and southern US with Republican voters less likely to believe in climate science Additionally denialism is highest in the central and southern US with Republican voters found less likely to believe in climate science. Using artificial intelligence researchers analyzed over 7.4m tweets posted by roughly 1.3 million people on the social media platform X previously Twitter between 2017 and 2019. The social media posts were geocoded and classified as for or against climate change using a large language model a type of artificial intelligence developed by OpenAI.  Over half of the tweets we looked at simply denied that climate change was real that it was a hoax said Joshua Newell coauthor of the study and professor of environment and sustainability at the University of Michigan. It wasn t surprising but it was disappointing I would hope that more and more Americans would believe in climate change and the importance of addressing it.  Donald Trump emerged as one of the most influential figures among climate change deniers. His tweets around a cold snap in Texas in December 2017 as well as his missives rejecting the 2018 IPCC report released at the Cop24 UN conference were some of his most engaged social media posts among climate change deniers.  Public figures such as Trump are highly influential Newell said when they use these events to trigger disbelief in climate change among social media users.  The findings are consistent with similar studies such as the recent survey out of Yale University which estimates that as of 2023 16 of Americans do not believe in climate change about 49 million people. Acceptance and belief in global warming is most prevalent along the west and east coasts correlating with those regions high rates of Democratic voters. Still clusters of denialism exist within blue states like in the case of Shasta county California. There disbelief in climate change is as high as 52 but statewide less than 12 of California s population does not believe in global warming.  It comports with my understanding that there is a small but very vocal and active minority of the public that still denies the overwhelming evidence of humancaused warming said Michael Mann climatologist and geophysicist at the University of Pennsylvania about the study. Last week Mann was awarded 1m in a defamation lawsuit against conservative writers who called his pioneering climate change research fraudulent comparing it to the work of a convicted child molester. In his book The New Climate War Mann argues that scientists have to rebut the misinformation and disinformation promoted on social media by bad actors not because we re going to win them over their ideological heels are dug in but because they are infecting the entire social media space with myths falsehoods and toxic antiscientific sentiment Mann said. Researchers use of AI helped classify millions of social media posts that otherwise would be too timeconsuming and expensive to conduct. Still some skepticism remains regarding the ethics of using AI for research as artificial intelligence has a documented history of bias especially in facial recognition highlighting the need for human vetting.  It s an intriguing new tool to use for these purposes Mann said. But its limitations must be kept in mind as it s an evolving technology.  It is up to social media platforms to combat misinformation and factcheck what the researchers call knowledge vulnerability .  There is proper action by the social media companies to monitor disinformation and to act accordingly Newell said referencing Trump s ban from X then Twitter following the January 6 insurrection. These very powerful social media companies should consider similar strategies for misinformation regarding climate change. 
https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/10/04/public-views-on-climate-change-and-climate-scientists/, Roughly fourinten Americans expect harmful effects from climate change on wildlife shorelines and weather patterns. At the same time many are optimistic that both policy and individual efforts to address climate change can have an impact. A narrow majority of Americans anticipate new technological solutions to problems connected with climate change and some 61 believe people will make major changes to their way of life within the next half century. On all of these matters there are wide differences along political lines with conservative Republicans much less inclined to anticipate negative effects from climate change or to judge proposed solutions as making much difference in mitigating any effects. Half or more liberal Democrats by contrast see negative effects from climate change as very likely and believe an array of policy solutions can make a big difference. Americans who are more deeply concerned about climate issues regardless of their partisan orientation are particularly likely to see negative effects ahead from climate change and strong majorities among this group think policy solutions can be effective at addressing climate change. Roughly twothirds of Americans say climate scientists should have a major role in policy decisions about climate matters more than say that the public energy industry leaders or national and international political leaders should be so involved. But overall majorities of Americans appear skeptical of climate scientists. No more than a third of the public gives climate scientists high marks for their understanding of climate change even fewer say climate scientists understand the best ways to address climate change. And while Americans trust information from climate scientists more than they trust that from other groups fewer than half of Americans have a lot of trust in information from climate scientists 39. A minority of Americans perceive that the best available scientific evidence is driving climate research findings most of the time. And a roughly equal share says other more negative factors influence climate research. People s trust and confidence in climate scientists varies widely depending on their political orientation. Liberal Democrats are much more trusting of climate scientists understanding of the issue and disclosure of full and accurate information about it. Republicans particularly conservatives are highly critical of climate scientists and more likely to ascribe negative rather than positive motives to the influences shaping scientists research. This chapter provides an overview of Americans attitudes about climate change and climate scientists. It then details the divides in these views among political groups and among those who are more or less concerned about climate issues. Americans who care more about the issue of climate change regardless of political orientation are more trusting of climate scientists more likely to expect negative effects to occur because of climate change and more likely to believe that both individual efforts and policy actions can be effective in addressing climate change. Roughly half of adults 48 say climate change is mostly due to human activity roughly threeinten say it is due to natural causes 31 and another fifth say there is no solid evidence of warming 20. The share saying human activity is the primary cause of climate change is about the same as Pew Research Center surveys in 2014 50 and 2009 49. Center surveys from 2006 to 2015 using somewhat different question wording found a similar share expressing this view 45 in the most recent 2015 survey. Large majorities of Americans think global warming will lead to an array of negative effects for the Earth s ecosystems. At least threequarters of Americans say that harm to animal habitats and plant life is very or fairly likely to occur. A similar share expects storms to become more severe and damage to shorelines or more frequent droughts to occur.1 Americans who believe global climate change is the result of human activity are far more likely than other Americans those who believe climate change results from natural patterns or that there is no evidence of global warming to say each of these effects is very likely. A 61 majority of the public expects Americans will make major changes to their ways of life in order to address problems from climate change within the next half century while 38 do not expect this to occur. The public as a whole sides to optimism 55 to 44 that new technological solutions will arise within the next 50 years that can solve most of the problems from climate change. There are a number of different proposals to address climate change. The Pew Research Center survey explored people s views about whether each of several policy and individual actions can be effective at addressing climate change. Americans are largely optimistic that restrictions on power plant emissions 51 and international agreements to limit carbon emissions 49 can make a big difference to address climate change. The Obama administration announced stricter limits on power plant emissions in 2015. This year more than 175 countries including the U.S. have signed the Paris Agreement which aims to reduce carbon emissions around the world. Public assessments of other policy proposals are similar. Some 46 say tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks can make a big difference in addressing climate change 45 say corporate tax incentives that encourage businesses to reduce carbon emissions caused by their actions can too. About fourinten Americans 41 say having more hybrid and electric vehicles on the road can have a big effect 38 think people s efforts to reduce their own carbon footprints as they go about daily living can make a big difference while another 44 say this can make a small difference. A majority of Americans say that climate scientists should have a role in policy decisions about climate issues. Twothirds 67 of U.S. adults say climate scientists should have a major role and 23 say they should have a minor role. Just 9 say climate scientists should have no role in policy issues regarding global climate change. Following scientific experts on the list 56 of adults say the general public should have a major role in policy decisions about climate issues followed by 53 that name energy industry leaders. By comparison fewer Americans believe elected officials should have a major role in climate policy decisions. In all 44 of U.S. adults say elected officials should have a major role another fourinten 40 say elected leaders should have a minor role in climate policymaking. Public views about the role of elected officials in policy decisions on climate issues may tie with deep public cynicism about the federal government generally. Or as shown later in this chapter those beliefs could tie to distrust that elected officials provide full and accurate information about the causes of climate change. People s normative views about the place of international leaders in these decisions are similar to that for U.S. leaders. Scientists first noted the possibility that the burning of greenhouse gases such as fossil fuels could increase temperatures back in the 1800s. A report from National Academy of Sciences in 1977 warned that the burning of fossil fuels could result in average temperatures increases of 6 degrees Celsius by the year 2150.2 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC which reflects scientific opinion on the topic stated in the forward to its 2013 report the science now shows with 95 percent certainty that human activity is the dominant cause of observed warming since the mid20th century. 3 And several analyses of scholarly publications suggest widespread consensus among climate scientists on this point.4 Similarly a Pew Research Center survey of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS found 93 of members with a Ph.D. in Earth sciences and 87 of all members say the Earth is warming mostly because of human behavior.5 But in the public eye there is considerably less consensus. Just 27 of Americans say that almost all climate scientists hold human behavior responsible for climate change. Another 35 say more than half of climate scientists agree about this while an equal share says that about fewer than half 20 or almost no 15 scientific experts believe that human behavior is the main contributing factor in climate change. Consistent with previous Pew Research Center studies people s perceptions of consensus among climate scientists are closely related to their beliefs about global climate change. Among those who say climate change is due to human activity many more say scientists are in agreement on the main cause of climate change. Americans appear to harbor significant reservations about climate scientists expertise and understanding of what is happening to the Earth s climate. Oneinthree adults 33 say climate scientists understand very well whether climate change is occurring another 39 say scientists understand this fairly well and some 27 say scientists don t understand this too well or don t understand it at all. Just over a quarter of the public 28 says climate scientists have a solid understanding of the causes of climate change. And even fewer 19 of adults say the same about climate scientists understanding of the best ways to address climate change. Americans hold relatively positive views about climate scientists compared with other groups as credible sources of information. Far more Americans say they trust information from climate scientists on the causes of climate change than say they trust either energy industry leaders the news media or elected officials. But in absolute terms public trust in information from climate scientists is limited. Some 39 of Americans say they trust climate scientists a lot when it comes to providing information about the causes of climate change. About a fifth of Americans 22 hold no trust or not too much trust in information from climate scientists. Another 39 report some trust in climate scientists to give a full and accurate portrait of the causes of climate change. Public trust in information from the news media energy industry leaders and elected officials is significantly lower however. A majority of Americans report having not too much or no trust in information from these groups about the causes of climate change. This survey included a series of questions that tapped into Americans beliefs of potential influences on climate research and the findings suggest some skepticism and mixed assessments from the public. A minority of 32 of Americans say climate research is influenced by the best available evidence most of the time 48 say this occurs some of the time and 18 take a decidedly skeptical view that the best evidence rarely or never influences research findings. A similar share of Americans say that scientists career aspirations influence their research most of the time 36. A smaller share of adults say scientists political leanings 27 or their desires to help related industries 26 influence climate research findings most of the time. But majorities say these less germane motivations influence results at least some of the time. While most Americans say the public s best interest factors into climate change research at least some of the time only 23 of Americans say climate research is influenced by concern for public interests most of the time. Overall 28 say this occurs not too often or never and 48 of Americans take a middle position saying this sometimes influences climate research findings. Throughout this report Republicans and Democrats include independents and other nonpartisans who lean toward the parties. Partisan leaners tend to have attitudes and opinions very similar to those of partisans. On questions about climate change and trust of climate scientists there are wide differences between those who lean to the Democratic Party and those who lean to the Republican Party. And leaners and partisans of their party have roughly the same positions on these questions. Political divides are dominant in public views about climate matters. Consistent with past Pew Research Center surveys most liberal Democrats espouse humancaused climate change while most conservative Republicans reject it. But this new Center survey finds that political differences over climate issues extend across a host of beliefs about the expected effects of climate change actions that can address changes to the Earth s climate and trust and credibility in the work of climate scientists. People on the ideological ends of either party that is liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans see the world through vastly different lenses across all of these judgments. As with previous Pew Research Center surveys there are wide differences among political party and ideology groups on whether or not human activity is responsible for warming temperatures. A large majority of liberal Democrats 79 believe the Earth is warming mostly because of human activity. In contrast only about oneinsix conservative Republicans 15 say this a difference of 64 percentage points. A much larger share of conservative Republicans say there is no solid evidence the Earth is warming 36 or that warming stems from natural causes 48. Pew Research Center surveys have found these kinds of wide political gaps in previous years. In the 2015 Center survey using somewhat different question wording there was a 41percentagepoint difference between partisans 64 of Democrats said climate change was mostly due to human activity compared with 23 among Republicans. People s beliefs about the likely effects of climate change are quite uniformly at odds across party and ideological lines. About sixinten or more of liberal Democrats say it is very likely that climate change will bring droughts storms that are more severe harm to animal and plant life and damage to shorelines from rising sea levels. By contrast no more than about twointen conservative Republicans say each of these possibilities is very likely about half consider these possibilities not too or not at all likely. There are more modest differences when it comes to people s expectations that technological breakthroughs will solve climate problems in the future or that the American people will make major changes to their way of life as a result of climate change. A majority of Democrats think technological changes will help address climate change within the next 50 years views among moderateliberal Republicans are similar. Some 46 of conservative Republicans think this will probably or definitely occur. Similarly about half of conservative Republicans 49 expect Americans to make major changes to their way of life to address climate issues within the next five decades as do majorities of other party and ideology groups. There is wide gulf between liberal Democrats and conservative Republicans when it comes to beliefs about how to effectively address climate change. Liberal Democrats are optimistic that a range of policy actions can make a big difference in addressing climate change including power plant emission limits international agreements about emissions tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles and corporate tax incentives to encourage businesses to reduce emissions resulting from their activities. And at least half of liberal Democrats say that both personal efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of everyday activities and more people driving hybrid and electric vehicles can make a big difference in addressing global warming. By contrast conservative Republicans are largely pessimistic about the effectiveness of these options. Most conservative Republicans say each of these actions would make a small difference or have no effect on climate change. About threeinten or fewer conservative Republicans say each would make a big difference. More than threequarters of Democrats and most Republicans 69 among moderate or liberal Republicans and 48 of conservative Republicans say climate scientists should have a major role in policy decisions related to climate issues. Few in either party say climate scientists should have no role in these policy decisions. But there some differences among party and ideology groups in their relative priorities about this. Conservative Republicans give a higher comparative priority to the general public in policy decisions about climate change issues. Democrats and moderateliberal Republicans prioritize a role for climate scientists. Relative to other groups rated fewer Americans think elected officials should have a major say in climate policy. Conservative Republicans stand out as being disinclined to support a major role for elected officials or leaders from other nations in climate policy. People s assessments of scientific understanding about climate also ties strongly to their political perspectives. Most liberal Democrats rate climate scientists as understanding very well whether climate change is occurring 68 and about half say scientists understand very well the causes of climate change 54. By contrast just 11 of conservative Republicans judge climate scientists as understanding very well the sources of climate change. Fully 63 of this group says climate scientists understand the causes of climate change not too or not at well.  Fewer in either party think climate scientists understand ways to address climate change. Some 36 of liberal Democrats say climate scientists understand this very well and 49 say scientists understand this fairly well. Conservative Republicans are particularly skeptical of climate scientists understanding of ways to address climate change just 8 say scientists understand how to address climate change very well 28 say fairly well and 64 rate scientific understanding of this as not too well or not at all well.  American s perceptions of scientific consensus on climate change are also related to political divides as has also been found in past Pew Research Center surveys.6 Liberal Democrats are far more likely than any other party or ideology group to see strong consensus among climate scientists. Some 55 of liberal Democrats say almost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change. Much smaller shares of other groups see widespread consensus among climate scientists. Some 29 of moderateconservative Democrats say almost all climate scientists agree that human behavior is responsible for climate change while some 16 of conservative Republicans and 13 of moderateliberal Republicans say the same. People s perceptions of scientific consensus even among liberal Democrats are at odds with the near unanimity expressed in climate research publications that human activity is mostly responsible for climate change however.7 Public trust in information from climate scientists about the causes of climate change varies widely among political groups. Seveninten 70 liberal Democrats trust climate scientists a lot to provide full and accurate information about this another 24 report some trust in information from climate scientists. In contrast just 15 of conservative Republicans say they trust climate scientists a lot to give full and accurate information fourinten 40 report some trust and 45 have not too much or no trust in information from climate scientists. Moderate or liberal Republicans and moderate or conservative Democrats fall in the middle between these two extremes in their level of trust. American s judgments about the credibility of climate research findings are also tied with people s political party and ideological orientations. At least half of liberal Democrats 55 say climate research is influenced by the best available evidence most of the time and 39 say this occurs some of the time. By contrast just 9 of conservative Republicans say the best evidence influences climate research most of the time though 54 say this occurs some of the time. Conservative Republicans are particularly skeptical about the factors influencing climate research. Some 57 of conservative Republicans say climate research is influenced by researchers career interests most of the time and 54 say the scientists own political leanings influence research findings most of the time. A much smaller share of liberal Democrats say either of these factors influence scientific research most of the time although many say scientists career interests or personal political leanings influence the findings some of the time 54 for each. The public s level of concern about climate matters varies. The Pew Research Center survey finds 36 of Americans particularly concerned saying they care a great deal about the issue of global climate change. An additional 38 express some interest while 26 say they care not too much or not at all about the issue of climate change. Not surprisingly those who care a great deal about global climate change issues are more attentive to climate news. Some 26 of those who care about climate issues a great deal follow climate news reports very closely compared with just 3 among those less concerned about these issues. Those most concerned about climate issues come from all gender age education race and ethnic groups. Those more concerned about climate issues are slightly more likely to be women than men 55 vs. 45. And they are more likely to be Hispanic than the population as whole. Politically those who care more deeply about climate issues tend to be Democrats. They include about equal shares of moderate or conservative Democrats 37 and liberal Democrats 35. Some 24 are Republicans. Political party affiliation and ideology are not the only factors that shape people s views about climate issues and climate scientists. People who say they care a great deal about this issue are far more likely to believe the Earth is warming because of human activities to believe negative effects from climate change are likely and that proposals to address climate change will be effective. This group also holds more positive views about climate scientists and their research on average. Differences between those more concerned and less concerned occur among both Republicans and Democrats. About threequarters of Americans who care deeply about climate change say the Earth is warming because of human activity 76 this compares with 48 among those who care some and just 10 among those who do not care at all or not too much about this issue. Differences between those who care more and less about climate change issues occur among both Republicans and Democrats. Some 44 of Republicans who care a great deal about climate issues believe human behavior is causing temperatures to rise compared with just 17 of Republicans who care some or less about this issue. Similarly among Democrats 87 of those who care a great deal about climate issues believe human activity is mostly responsible for global climate change compared with 52 among those who care some or less about the issue of climate change. Large majorities of those who care most about this issue think it is very likely that climate change will hurt the environment. Roughly threequarters of those deeply concerned about climate issues think climate change will very likely bring harm to animal life 74 damage to forests and plants life 74 more droughts 73 more severe storms 74 and damage to shorelines from rising sea levels 74. By contrast roughly a third of those who care some about this issue say each of these possible effects is very likely. Many of those who do not care at all or not too much about the issue of climate change say the evidence of warming is uncertain this group is particularly skeptical that any of these harms will come to pass. Differences among the more and less concerned about climate issues occur both among Republicans and Democrats alike. There are smaller differences when it comes to people s expectations that Americans will make major changes to their way of life in order to address climate change. About twothirds of those who care a great deal about climate issues 67 expect this to occur within the next 50 years as does a similar share of those who care some about this issue 70 and 42 of those who do not care at all or not too much about the issue of climate change. And 63 of the more climateengaged Americans expect new technological solutions to address most problems stemming from climate change. Those who care some about climate issues hold similar views 62 expect technological solutions. Those who have little personal concern about the issue of climate change are more skeptical 34 expect technological solutions 64 do not. Majorities of climateengaged Americans are optimistic that a range of both policy and individual actions can make a big difference in addressing climate change. Those less personally concerned about climate issues are considerably more pessimistic by comparison. About eightinten of those more deeply concerned about climate issues say restrictions on power plant emissions 80 and an international agreement to limit carbon emissions 78 can make a big difference in addressing climate change. Some 73 of this group says tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks can make a big difference and seveninten 70 say the same about corporate tax incentives to encourage businesses to reduce the carbon emissions stemming from their activities. By contrast no more than twointen American who are not at all or not too personally concerned about climate issues think each of these policy actions can make a big difference although a sizeable minority among this group says each can make a small difference. Those who care some about the issue of climate change fall in between these two extremes roughly fourinten of this group say each of these policy actions can make a big difference a roughly similar share says each can make a small difference. The same pattern occurs when it comes to individual efforts to address climate change. Among those who care deeply about climate issues 63 believe individual efforts to reduce the carbon footprint linked with one s daily activities can make a big difference. Among those who care some about this issue about half as many say this can make a big difference 33 and most 58 say it can make a small difference. Just 12 of those with little personal concern about climate change say individual efforts of this sort can make a big difference 42 says this can make a small difference and 43 says this will have almost no effect. Similarly some 63 of those personally concerned about climate issues say more people driving hybrid and electric vehicles can make a big difference in addressing climate change compared with 40 among those who care some about climate issues and just 13 among those who do not care at all or not too much about climate issues. People who care more deeply about climate issues are also more likely than others in the general public to see climate scientists and their work in a positive light. Nearly all 90 Americans who are deeply concerned about climate change issues support a major role for climate scientists in related policy decisions as do 68 of Americans with some personal concern about climate issues. About a third 34 of those with not too much or no personal concern about climate issues say climate scientists should have a major role and 41 say scientists should have a minor role in climate policy. This pattern holds among both Democrats and Republicans. For example some 87 of Republicans who care a great deal about climate issues say climate scientists should have a major role in climate policy. This compares with 48 among other Republicans. Those who care a great deal about climate issues are much more likely than other Americans to say climate scientists understand very well whether change is occurring 64 vs. 23 among those care some and 7 among those do not care at all or not too much about this issue. About half of those deeply concerned about climate issues 52 say climate scientists understand very well the causes of climate change compared with just 19 among those with some personal concern and just 8 among those with no or not too much personal concern about this issue. More Americans who care a great deal about climate issues say scientists understand the best ways to address climate change very well 37 or fairly well 48. Many fewer of less climateconcerned adults say the same. Just 13 of those with some personal concern about climate issues say scientists understand very well how to address climate change while 56 say scientists understand this fairly well. And just 5 of those with no or little personal concern about climate issues say scientists understand very well how to address climate change 25 say scientists understand this fairly well and 68 say scientists do not understand this at all or not too well. Differences over climate scientists understanding occur among both Democrats and Republicans who are relatively more and less concerned about climate change. Similarly people who care more about climate issues are more inclined to see consensus among scientists about the causes of climate change. Some 48 of the climateconcerned public says that almost all climate scientists agree that human activity is responsible for climate change this compares with just 19 saying almost all scientists agree about this among those who care some about climate issues and 12 among those who do not care at all or not too much about climate issues. Those more concerned about global climate issues are far more trusting of information from climate scientists than are those less concerned about these issues. Twothirds of the public who cares a great deal about climate issues 67 say they trust climate scientists a lot to provide full and accurate information on the causes of global climate change. In contrast 33 of those who care some about climate issues trust scientists information a lot while 53 trust it some. Just 9 of those with little or no personal concern about climate issues trust scientists information a lot 36 trust it some and 55 have not too much or no trust in information from climate scientists about this. Democrats and Republicans who care a great deal about climate issues are more than twice as likely as their fellow partisans to hold a lot of trust in information from climate scientists. Among Republicans who care about climate issues 46 trust climate scientists information a lot compared with 16 among other Republicans. Among Democrats fully 76 of those who care about climate issues a great deal say they trust climate scientists information a lot compared with 34 among other Democrats. Americans who are more concerned with climate issues are inclined to think research findings on climate are influenced by the best available evidence about half of this group 51 says research is influenced by the best evidence most of the time and 39 say this occurs some of the time. In contrast threeinten 30 of those with some personal concern about climate issues say the best evidence influences climate research findings most of the time 60 say this occurs some of the time. Just 9 of those with no or not too much personal concern about climate issues say the best evidence influences climate research findings most of the time 42 say this occurs some of the time and 45 say this occurs not too often or never. By the same token there are similar differences in views about negative influences on research between those who care deeply about climate issues and those who do not the climateconcerned public is less inclined to see such research as influenced by scientists personal political leanings a desire to help their industries or their careers. The news media are a key source of information about climate issues. The Pew Research Center survey finds only a small minority 11 of Americans follow news about climate matters very closely. Another 44 follow somewhat closely and an equal share follows news not too 32 or not at all closely 12. Overall Americans are closely divided in their assessments of media coverage on climate issues. Some 47 say the news media do a very or somewhat good job while 51 say they do a bad job covering climate issues. These findings stand in contrast to American s views about the media overall. As shown elsewhere in this report just 5 say they have a great deal of confidence in the news media generally to act in the public interest. A 2013 Pew Research Center report documents the steep decline in public regard for media accuracy fairness and independence over the past two decades. People who say they closely follow climate news tend to give the media somewhat higher marks for coverage in this area as do those who say care a great deal about climate issues. Public views about media performance also tend to divide along political lines. Conservative Republicans are especially critical of media coverage on climate issues with 71 of this group saying the media do a bad job. Moderate and liberal Republicans are closely divided in their overall evaluations of news coverage on climate 47 say they do a good job and 52 say they do a bad job. The balance of opinion is more positive among moderate and conservative Democrats 64 good to 34 bad though liberal Democrats are closely divided 48 to 51 on this issue. This pattern is broadly consistent with other Pew Research Center studies on views of the media. The public divide over media performance in this area could link to the balance of coverage on climate issues. The Pew Research Center survey included two additional questions exploring people s views about news coverage. Overall some 35 of Americans say the media exaggerate the threat from climate change while a roughly similar share 42 of adults says the media do not take the threat seriously enough. Twointen 20 adults says the media are about right in their reporting about climate. The same pattern occurs on a question about the balance of attention to those skeptical of climate change. Fourinten 40 adults say the media give too little attention to skeptics while a slightly smaller share 32 says the media give skeptics too much attention. A quarter of Americans 25 say the media are about right in their coverage of those skeptical about climate change. In keeping with the wide political divides on beliefs about climate issues there are strong political differences in views about media coverage of climate change. A majority of conservative Republicans 72 say the media exaggerate the threat of climate change while some 64 of liberal Democrats say the media do not take the threat seriously enough. Opinions about media coverage of skeptics follow a similar pattern. Some 59 of conservative Republicans say the media give too little attention to skeptics of climate change. In contrast about half of liberal Democrats 54 say the media give too much attention to skeptics of climate change. Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers

Climate Change Basics Click items to expand answers Should we call it climate change global warming or the climate crisis? Each of these terms describes parts of the same problem the fact that the average temperature of Earth is rising. As the planet heats up global warming we see broad impacts on Earth s climate such as shifting seasons rising sea level and melting ice. As the impacts of climate change become more frequent and more severe they will create and in many cases they already are creating crises for people and nature around the world. Many types of extreme weather including heatwaves heavy downpours hurricanes and wildfires are becoming stronger and more dangerous. Left unchecked these impacts will spread and worsen affecting our homes and cities economies food and water supplies as well as the species ecosystems and biodiversity of this planet we all call home. All of these terms are accurate and there s no perfect one that will make everyone realize the urgency of action. Whatever you choose to call it the most important thing is that we act to stop it. Yes scientists agree that the warming we are seeing today is entirely humancaused. Climate has changed in the past due to natural factors such as volcanoes changes in the sun s energy and the way the Earth orbits the sun. In fact these natural factors should be cooling the planet. However our planet is warming. Scientists have known for centuries that the Earth has a natural blanket of greenhouse or heattrapping gases. This blanket keeps the Earth more than 30 degrees Celsius over 60 degrees Fahrenheit warmer than it would be otherwise. Without this blanket our Earth would be a frozen ball of ice. Greenhouse gases which include carbon dioxide and methane trap some of the Earth s heat that would otherwise escape to space. The more heattrapping gases in the atmosphere the thicker the blanket and the warmer it gets. Over Earth s history heattrapping gas levels have gone up and down due to natural factors. Today however by burning fossil fuels causing deforestation forests are key parts of the planet s natural carbon management systems and operating largescale industrial agriculture humans are rapidly increasing levels of heattrapping gases in the atmosphere. The humancaused increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is much greater than any observed in the paleoclimate history i.e. ancient climate data measured through ice sheets tree rings sediments and more of the earth. As a result temperature in the air and ocean is now increasing faster than at any time in human history. Scientists have looked at every other possible reason why climate might be changing today and their conclusions are clear. There s no question it s us. One of the main reasons scientists are so worried about climate change is the speed at which it is occurring. In many cases these changes are happening faster than animals plants and ecosystems can safely adapt to and the same is true for human civilization. We ve never seen climate change this quickly and it is putting our food and water systems our infrastructure and even our economies at risk. In some places these changes are already crossing safe levels for ecosystems and humans. That s why the more we do to mitigate these risks the better off we will all be. Climate change is affecting our planet in many ways. Average temperatures are increasing rainfall patterns are shifting snow lines are retreating glaciers and ice sheets are melting permafrost is thawing sea levels are rising and severe weather is becoming more frequent. In particular heatwaves are becoming more frequent and more intense. Tropical cyclones like hurricanes typhoons and cyclones are intensifying faster and dumping more rain. Wildfires are burning greater area and in many areas around the world heavy rainfall is becoming more frequent and droughts are getting stronger. All of these impacts are concerning because they can harm and even potentially lead to the collapse of ecosystems and human systems. And it s clear that they become more severe the more heattrapping gases we produce. Rapid changes in climate can directly and indirectly impact animals across the world. Many species are approaching or have already reached the limit of where they can go to find hospitable climates. In the polar regions animals like polar bears that live on sea ice are now struggling to survive as that ice melts. It s not just how climate change affects an animal directly it s about how the warming climate affects the ecosystem and food chain to which an animal has adapted. For example in the U.S. and Canada moose are being affected by an increase in ticks and parasites that are surviving the shorter milder winters. In western North America salmon rely on steadyflowing cold rivers to spawn. As climate change alters the temperature and flow of these waterways some salmon populations are dwindling. This change in salmon population affects many species that rely on salmon like orcas or grizzly bears. Changes in temperature and moisture are causing some species to migrate in search of new places to live. For instance in North America species are shifting their ranges an average of 11 miles north and 36 feet higher in elevation each decade to find more favorable conditions. The Central Appalachians are one resilient climate escape route that may help species adapt to changing conditions. There are some natural places with enough topographical diversity such that even as the planet warms they can be resilient strongholds for plant and animal species. These strongholds serve as breeding grounds and seed banks for many plants and animals that otherwise may be unable to find habitat due to climate change. However strongholds are not an option for all species and some plants and animals are blocked from reaching these areas by human development like cities highways and farmland. Here at The Nature Conservancy we use science to identify such locations and work with local partners and communities to do everything we can to protect them. From reducing agricultural productivity to threatening livelihoods and homes climate change is affecting people everywhere. You may have noticed how weather patterns near you are shifting or how more frequent and severe storms are developing in the spring. Maybe your community is experiencing more severe flooding or wildfires. Many areas are even experiencing sunny day flooding as rising sea levels cause streets to flood during high tides. In Alaska some entire coastal communities are being moved because the sea level has risen and what used to be permanently frozen ground has thawed to the point where their original location is no longer habitable. Climate change also exacerbates the threat of humancaused conflict resulting from a scarcity of resources like food and water that become less reliable as growing seasons change and rainfall patterns become less predictable. Many of these impacts are disproportionately affecting lowincome Indigenous or marginalized communities. For example in large cities in North America lowincome communities are often hotter during heatwaves more likely to flood during heavy downpours and the last to have their power restored after storms. Around the globe many of the poorest nations are being impacted first and most severely by climate change even though they have contributed far less to the carbon pollution that has caused the warming in the first place. Climate change affects us all but it doesn t affect us all equally and that s not fair. Whether you live close to a coast or far from one what happens in oceans matters to our lives. Earlier we described how greenhouse gases trap heat around the planet. Only a small fraction of the extra heat being trapped by the carbon pollution blanket is going into heating up the atmosphere. Almost 90 of the heat is going into the ocean causing the ocean to warm. Warmer water takes up more space causing sea level to rise. As landbased ice melts this addition of water from land to the ocean causes the ocean to rise even faster. Warmer oceans can drive fish migrations and lead to coral bleaching and die off. As the ocean surface warms it s less able to mix with deep nutrientrich water which limits the growth of phytoplankton little plants that serve as the base of the marine food web and that also produce a lot of the oxygen we breathe. This in turn affects the whole food chain. In addition to taking up heat the oceans are also absorbing about a quarter of the carbon pollution that humans produce. In addition to warming the air and water of our planet some of this extra carbon dioxide is being absorbed by the ocean making our oceans more acidic. In fact the rate of ocean acidification is the highest it has been in 300 million years! This acidification negatively impacts many marine habitats and animals but is a particular threat to shellfish which struggle to grow shells as water becomes more acidic. There s also evidence that warming surface waters may contribute to slowing ocean currents. These currents act like a giant global conveyor belt that transports heat from the tropics toward the poles. This conveyor belt is critical for bringing nutrientrich waters towards the surface near the poles where giant blooms of food websupporting phytoplankton occur this is why the Arctic and Antarctic are known for having such high abundance of fish and marine mammals. With continued warming these processes may be at risk. Climate change is disrupting weather patterns leading to more extreme and frequent heatwaves droughts and flooding events that directly threaten harvests. Warmer seasons are also contributing to rising populations of insect pests that eat a higher share of crop yields and higher carbon dioxide levels are causing plants to grow faster while decreasing their nutritional content. Flooding drought and heatwaves have decimated crops in China. In Bangladesh rising sea levels are threatening rice crops. In the midwestern United States more frequent and intense rains have caused devastating spring flooding which delays and sometimes prevents planting activities. These impacts make it more difficult for farmers to grow crops and sustain their livelihoods. Globally one recent study finds that staple crop yield failures will be 4.5 times higher by 2030 and 25 times higher by midcentury. That means a major rice or wheat failure every other year and higher probabilities of soybean and maize failures. However farmers are poised to play a significant role in addressing climate change. Agricultural lands are among the Earth s largest natural reservoirs of carbon and when farmers use soil health practices like cover crops reduced tillage and crop rotations they can draw carbon out of the atmosphere. These practices also help to improve the soil s waterholding capacity which is beneficial as water can be absorbed from the soil by crops during times of drought and during heavy rainfalls soil can help reduce flooding and runoff by slowing the release of water into streams. Healthier soils can also improve crop yields boost farmers profitability and reduce erosion and fertilizer runoff from farm fields which in turn means cleaner waterways for people and nature. That s why climatesmart agriculture is a winwin! Yes deforestation land use change and agricultural emissions are responsible for about a quarter of heattrapping gas emissions from human activities. Agricultural emissions include methane from livestock digestion and manure nitrous oxide from fertilizer use and carbon dioxide from land use change. Forests are one of our most important types of natural carbon storage so when people cut down forests they lose their ability to store carbon. Burning trees either through wildfires or controlled burns releases even more carbon into the atmosphere. Forests are some of the best natural climate solutions we have on this planet. If we can slow or stop deforestation manage natural land so that it is healthy and use other natural climate solutions such as climatesmart agricultural practices we could achieve up to one third of the emission reductions needed by 2030 to keep global temperatures from rising more than 2 C 3.6 F. That s the equivalent of the world putting a complete stop to burning oil. When it comes to climate change there s no one solution that will fix it all. Rather there are many solutions that together can address this challenge at scale while building a safer more equitable and greener world. First we need to reduce our heattrapping gas emissions as much as possible as soon as possible. Through efficiency and behavioral change we can reduce the amount of energy we need. At the same time we have to transition all sectors of our economy away from fossil fuels that emit carbon through increasing our use of clean energy sources like wind and solar. This transition will happen much faster and more costeffectively if governments enact an economywide price on carbon. Second we need to harness the power of nature to capture carbon and deploy agricultural practices and technologies that capture and store carbon. Our research shows that proper land management of forests and farmlands also called natural climate solutions can provide up to onethird of the emissions reductions necessary to reach the Paris Climate Agreement s goal. The truth however is that even if we do successfully reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050 we will still have to address harmful climate impacts. That s why there is a third category of climate solutions that is equally important adaptation to the impacts of global warming. Adaptation consists of helping our human and natural systems prepare for the impacts of a warming planet. Greening urban areas helps protect them from heat and floods restoring coastal wetlands helps protect from storm surge increasing the diversity of ecosystems helps them to weather heat and drought growing superreefs helps corals withstand marine heatwaves. There are many ways we can use technology behavioral change and nature to work together to make us more resilient to climate impacts. Climate change affects us all but it doesn t affect us all equally or fairly. We see how sea level rise threatens communities of small island states like Kiribati and the Solomon Islands and of lowlying neighborhoods in coastal cities like Mumbai Houston and Lagos. Similarly people living in many lowincome neighborhoods in urban areas in North America are disproportionately exposed to heat and flood risk due to a long history of racist policies like redlining. Those who have done the least to contribute to this problem often bear the brunt of the impacts and have the fewest resources to adapt. That s why it is particularly important to help vulnerable communities adapt and become more resilient to climate change. We need to increase renewable energy at least ninefold from where it is today to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and avoid the worst climate change impacts. Every watt that we can reduce through efficiency or shift from fossil fuel to renewables like wind power or solar power is a step in the right direction. The best science we have tells us that to avoid the worst impacts of global warming we must globally achieve netzero carbon emissions no later than 2050. To do this the world must immediately identify pathways to reduce carbon emissions from all sectors transportation agriculture electricity and industry. This cannot be achieved without a major shift to renewable energy. Clean energy and technological innovation are not only helping mitigate climate change but also helping create jobs and support economic growth in communities across the world. Renewable energy such as wind and solar have experienced remarkable growth and huge cost improvements over the past decade with no signs of slowing down. Prices are declining rapidly and renewable energy is becoming increasingly competitive with fossil fuels all around the world. In some places new renewable energy is already cheaper than continuing to operate old inefficient and dirty fossil fuelfired power plants. However it s important that renewable energy development isn t built at the expense of protecting unique ecosystems or important agricultural lands. Without proactive planning renewable energy developments could displace up to 76 million acres of farm and wildlife habitat an area the size of Arizona. Fortunately TNC studies have found that we can meet clean energy demand 17 times over without converting more natural habitat. The key is to deploy new energy infrastructure on the wealth of previously converted areas such as agricultural lands mine sites and other transformed terrain at a lower cost. Thoughtful planning is required at every step. For instance much of the United States wind potential is in the Great Plains a region with the best remaining grassland habitat on the continent. TNC has mapped out the right places to site wind turbines in this region in order to catalyze renewable energy responsibly and we re doing the same analysis for India and Europe as well. There can also be unique interventions to protect wildlife where clean energy has already been developed. In Kenya for instance a wind farm employs biodiversity monitors to watch for migrating birds and can order individual turbines to shut down in less than a minute. The Nature Conservancy is committed to tackling the dual crises of climate change and biodiversity loss. These two crises are as our chief scientist says two sides of the same coin. What we do between now and 2030 will determine if we get on track to meet the targets of the Paris Agreement while also conserving enough land and water to slow accelerated species loss. That s why we have ambitious 2030 goals that focus on people and the planet. Visit Our Goals for 2030 to learn more about TNC s actions and partnerships to tackle climate change this decade. Some amount of change has already occurred and some future changes are inevitable due to our past choices. However the good news is that we know what causes it and what to do to stop it. It will take courage ambition and a push to create change but it can be done. Reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050 is an ambitious goal one that s going to require substantial effort across every sector of the economy. We don t have a lot of time but if we are prepared to act now and act together we can substantially reduce the rate of global warming and prevent the worst impacts of climate change from coming to pass. The even better news is that the low carbon economy that we need to create will also give us cleaner air more abundant food and water more affordable energy choices and safer cities. Likewise many of the solutions to even today s climate change impacts benefit both people and nature. When we really understand the benefits of climate action how it will lead us to a world that is safer and healthier more just and equitable the only question we have left is What are we waiting for? Scientific studies show that climate change if unchecked would overwhelm our communities and pose an existential threat to certain ecosystems. These catastrophic impacts include sea level rise from melting ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica that would flood most major global coastal cities increasingly common and more severe storms droughts and heatwaves massive crop failures and water shortages and the largescale destruction of habitats and ecosystems leading to species extinctions. To avoid the worst of climate change the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC says that every bit of warming matters. When it comes to limiting climate change there s no magic threshold the faster we reduce our emissions the better off we will be. In 2015 all the countries in the world came together and signed the Paris Agreement. It s a legally binding international treaty in which signatories agree to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C 3.5 F above preindustrial levels and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C 2.7 F above preindustrial levels.  Every day that goes by we are releasing carbon into the atmosphere and increasing our planetary risk. Scientists agree that we need to begin reducing carbon emissions RIGHT NOW. To reach the goal of the Paris Agreement the world must make significant progress toward decarbonization reducing carbon from the atmosphere and replacing fossil fuels in our economies by 2030 and commit ourselves to reaching net zero carbon emissions by 2050. This is no small feat and will require a range of solutions applied together to reach the goal. As the IPCC says every action matters. You can be part of the climate change solution and you can activate others too. It s really important that we use our voices for climate action. Tell your policy makers that you care about climate change and want to see them enact laws and policies that address greenhouse gas emissions and climate impacts. One of the simplest and most important things that everyone can do is to talk about climate change with family and friends. We know these conversations can seem like a recipe for discord and hard feelings. It starts with meeting people where they are. TNC has resources to help you break the climate silence and pave the way for action on global warming. You can also talk about climate change where you work and with any other organization you re part of. Join an organization that shares your values and priorities to help amplify your voice. Collective change begins with understanding the risks climate change poses and the actions that can be taken together to reduce emissions and build resilience. Lastly you can calculate your carbon footprint and take actions individually or with your family and friends to lower it. You might be surprised which of your activities are emitting the most heattrapping gases. But don t forget to talk about the changes you ve made to help make them contagious contagious in a good way of course!  Stay connected for the latest news from nature.

Petit et al. NOAA Mauna Loa CO2 record. Find out more about ice cores external site.The current warming trend is different because it is clearly the result of human activities since the mid1800s and is proceeding at a rate not seen over many recent millennia.1 It is undeniable that human activities have produced the atmospheric gases that have trapped more of the Sun s energy in the Earth system. This extra energy has warmed the atmosphere ocean and land and widespread and rapid changes in the atmosphere ocean cryosphere and biosphere have occurred. Scientists demonstrated the heattrapping nature of carbon dioxide and other gases in the mid19th century.2 Many of the science instruments NASA uses to study our climate focus on how these gases affect the movement of infrared radiation through the atmosphere. From the measured impacts of increases in these gases there is no question that increased greenhouse gas levels warm Earth in response. Ice cores drawn from Greenland Antarctica and tropical mountain glaciers show that Earth s climate responds to changes in greenhouse gas levels. Ancient evidence can also be found in tree rings ocean sediments coral reefs and layers of sedimentary rocks. This ancient or paleoclimate evidence reveals that current warming is occurring roughly 10 times faster than the average rate of warming after an ice age. Carbon dioxide from human activities is increasing about 250 times faster than it did from natural sources after the last Ice Age.3 Global Temperature Is RisingThe planets average surface temperature has risen about 2 degrees Fahrenheit 1 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere and other human activities.4 Most of the warming occurred in the past 40 years with the seven most recent years being the warmest. The years 2016 and 2020 are tied for the warmest year on record.5Image credit Ashwin Kumar Creative Commons AttributionShare Alike 2.0 Generic. The Ocean Is Getting WarmerThe ocean has absorbed much of this increased heat with the top 100 meters about 328 feet of ocean showing warming of 0.67 degrees Fahrenheit 0.33 degrees Celsius since 1969.6 Earth stores 90 of the extra energy in the ocean.Image credit Kelsey RobertsUSGS The Ice Sheets Are ShrinkingThe Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets have decreased in mass.

In 1824 Joseph Fourier calculated that an Earthsized planet at our distance from the Sun ought to be much colder. He suggested something in the atmosphere must be acting like an insulating blanket. In 1856 Eunice Foote discovered that blanket showing that carbon dioxide and water vapor in Earths atmosphere trap escaping infrared heat radiation. In the 1860s physicist John Tyndall recognized Earths natural greenhouse effect and suggested that slight changes in the atmospheric composition could bring about climatic variations. In 1896 a seminal paper by Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius first predicted that changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide levels could substantially alter the surface temperature through the greenhouse effect. In 1938 Guy Callendar connected carbon dioxide increases in Earth s atmosphere to global warming. In 1941 Milutin Milankovic linked ice ages to Earth s orbital characteristics. Gilbert Plass formulated the Carbon Dioxide Theory of Climate Change in 1956.  3. IPCC Sixth Assessment Report WG1 Chapter 2Vostok ice core data NOAA Mauna Loa CO2 recordO. Gaffney W.

https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2023/08/09/why-some-americans-do-not-see-urgency-on-climate-change/, The Center completed indepth interviews with 32 U.S. adults to discuss their views about climate change extreme weather and environmental problems. The interviews were conducted online by Sago a market research firm between May 15 and 26 2023. Interviews were conducted with people who said that addressing climate change is not a top priority for the country and who did not see human activity as the primary reason the Earth is getting warmer including some who said there was no evidence that the Earth is warming. Interviews included adults living in five geographic regions in the United States the Midwest Mountain West Southwest South and Coastal Florida. Here is the interviewer guide used for the indepth interviews and more on its methodology. Quotations featured in this report have been lightly edited for grammar and clarity. A companion report Majorities of Americans Prioritize Renewable Energy Back Steps to Address Climate Change analyzed public opinion on climate energy and environmental issues based on a survey of 10329 U.S. adults from May 30 to June 4 2023. As the Earth s temperature continues to rise fueling more intense storms and extreme weather scientists are calling for immediate action to address climate change. However climate change remains a lower priority for some Americans and a subset of the public rejects that it s happening at all. To better understand the perspectives of those who see less urgency to address climate change Pew Research Center conducted indepth interviews with 32 U.S. adults who hold this view including some who do not believe there s evidence that the Earth is warming. Unlike much of our work on climate change these interviews are not representative of all U.S. adults rather they are designed to provide deeper insight into the motivations and views of those most skeptical about climate change. The interviews revealed that language describing climate change as a crisis and an urgent threat was met with suspicion by many participants. The disconnect between crisis rhetoric and the participants own beliefs and experiences drove doubt about the motivations of the people making these claims sowing suspicion and deeper mistrust.  Interviewees widely rejected the national news media as a credible source for climate information. They see these outlets as presenting information that suits their own agendas. Interviewees generally expressed greater openness toward hearing from scientists on climate change because of their subject matter expertise. Still participants stressed the importance of hearing factual statements from scientists rather than beliefs that may be shaped by their own political leanings or their research funders. On policy interviewees were open to government efforts to improve environmental quality including air and water quality especially when these efforts were at the local level. The conversations underscore areas of common ground around environmental protection regardless of Americans level of concern about climate change. When it comes to measures aimed at transitioning the country toward renewable energy interviewees stressed the importance of respecting individual freedoms and individual choice in any energy transition. This theme was underscored by criticism of policies like ending the production of new gaspowered vehicles. Nationally representative Pew Research Center surveys show that fewer than half of all Americans reject that humans are major contributors to climate change or say addressing the issue is not too important for the country. Even smaller shares take the most skeptical views and say the Earth is not warming at all and that no action should be taken. Overall 46 of Americans say human activity is the primary reason why the Earth is warming. By contrast 26 say warming is mostly caused by natural patterns in the environment and another 14 do not believe there s evidence the Earth is warming at all. When it comes to policy action 37 of Americans think addressing climate change should be a top priority for the president and Congress and another 34 say it is an important but lower priority. By contrast about threeinten say action on climate change is not too important 17 or should not be done 11. Republicans are much less likely than Democrats to prioritize climate action though individuals who are skeptical about addressing climate change are seen within both party coalitions and across demographic groups. Read this post for a roundup of survey data on how Americans feel about climate change. Indepth interviews with adults who view climate change as a lower priority and do not think the Earth is getting warmer primarily due to human activity were conducted virtually in May 2023 across five geographic areas the Midwest Mountain West South Southwest and Coastal Florida. Participants were selected based on their views on climate change and to ensure a broad mix of interviewees across characteristics including party ideology gender and education. The analysis of these 32 interviews is designed to highlight common themes that emerged across conversations. The analysis and quotations are meant to offer a deeper exploration of the why behind the views and beliefs of those who see climate action as a lower priority.  I do believe the climate is changing but I believe it is changing in a natural cycle that happens all the time. What I don t believe is that humans are 100 responsible for climate change. Man 50s Mountain West  I think that extreme weather events are not happening more. I think people know about them more. We know about a tsunami that happened across the world whereas 50 years ago we never even heard of it. It may seem like things are happening more and more but I think that just that s the cycle of life the cycle of Earth. And if they are happening a little more then that is just the cyclical part of what s going on with the planet. Man 50s Coastal Florida A common explanation across interviews was that any changes to Earth s climate are a natural part of the planet s cycles that humans cannot control. Extreme weather was explained in a similar way with many saying these events are natural occurrences that have not become more frequent and severe because of climate change. Most of the 32 interviewees perceived claims of a climate crisis as exaggerated and they connected this sense of overblown rhetoric with a need for increased scrutiny toward such claims. One of the most common frustrations participants raised is the way that people talk about climate change as a crisis that requires immediate action. Many said that when they hear these arguments they react with disbelief and increased scrutiny of the motives behind such statements. As one participant put it People who are alarmist tend to want really drastic policies that seem to not make sense so it kind of makes me disbelieve the other things they re saying. Man 20s Midwest Another said From a personal standpoint whether it s the climate or anything else when the statements are too large like when the statements are The world is getting warmer and Earth is going to be ended in five years because we re all terrible humans and we throw trash on the ground. Those things cause me to be instead of causing me to be concerned it causes me to be more skeptical about where the information is coming from and why it s being presented in such a grandiose term for lack of a better word. Woman 30s Midwest Participants expressed trust in climate scientists while also considering that some might have personal biases. The openness to hearing from scientists on this issue was in contrast to their views of media outlets. Most interviewees said that the news media cannot be trusted for information about climate change.  I think that scientists if they worked hard for their degree it s good to listen to them. I do always wonder with anybody anybody if they have an agenda. It s looking into maybe where their education is what groups or environmental groups are they a part of. What is their main focus? And then is there an agenda behind what they re saying? Woman 40s Mountain West  Networks and radio and newspapers and television they re all getting paid to tell me something. And if they don t have my attention then they re not getting paid. So they ll do whatever they need to get my attention. So they will stretch things. I m sure that in the past they ve made up stories or or you know make you try to feel something that s not necessarily important or whatnot. It s all about ratings and you know getting people to watch. Man 40s South Interviewees expressed some support for using more renewable energy alongside concerns about the pace and practicality of this transition. As one participant explained I think we re so reliant on carbonbased fuels for our economy and the way we live. We have to cripple ourselves to switch over. It would have to take 40 50 years reasonably to do that so if we re going to ban gas cars by 2035 I think it is too excessive. Man 20s Midwest Participants shared hesitations about increased use of electric vehicles EVs as part of a renewable energy transition. Some questioned whether EVs harmed the environment I think that with everything that s in place over the last five years and there s good and bad so all these people again no one s addressing the electric car in the energy and the minerals it depletes from the Earth. That s an environmental issue. Man 50s Southwest And some saw logistical challenges with EVs such as many people lacking space at home to charge It s not practical for everyone to purchase a Tesla or be able to have the ability to plug in a car at their home or to quite frankly pay to charge up a car and have an additional expense or additional changes to their lifestyle that is always productive or applicable. Woman 30s Midwest While interviewees saw less urgency on climate change action they expressed an openness to government efforts to help the environment and preserve natural lands and waterways especially when these actions were at the state and local level. They also supported individual action in areas such as recycling and limiting waste.  I think the best way to protect the environment is just educating people on what steps we can take that aren t extreme meaning don t ban gas combustion vehicles. Don t ban gas stoves. Give people the information. Let them decide what they want to do. But when you start to force things upon people that s when people become skeptical. It s like why are they forcing something on to us? Why are they changing laws? Man 40s Southwest  And it is so very important that we take care of our planet. Let s not litter. Let s have good clean water. Let s not do anything that s going to hurt our planet that we live in. And so that s what I feel about everybody s duty to take care of everybody takes care of their own little piece and I think it s going to be fine. Man 50s Coastal Florida When we talked with people about their views of climate change most of the 32 interviewees explained that the Earth is warming mostly because of natural cycles of the environment not human activity. Participants often supported their view by pointing to the planet s history of warming and cooling as evidence of these natural cycles happening now. The emphasis on natural cycles was cited as a reason why humans have a limited role in affecting climate change. A few interviewees were skeptical of whether climate change is happening at all with the two most skeptical interviewees saying that climate change is a hoax used only for political gains. Interviewees offered similar explanations for extreme weather as they did for climate change. These events were often seen as a natural part of the Earth s climate system and not something that has become more frequent or more severe because of climate change. A common view among interviewees was that changes in the Earth s climate are due to natural patterns that the Earth has always experienced. Those with this view often said that the climate is changing but pointed to evidence of planetary cycles as proof that any current climate change is natural.  It s my opinion based on the science that I ve seen generated if you go through and look at the studies of Earth we go through these peaks and valleys of climate. We have since the Earth was created. Why are we not going through one of those peaks as we speak now? I haven t seen enough proof to deter me otherwise. Man 50s Mountain West  I believe it s cyclical. And the reason why I believe this is because there were record high temperatures more than 100 years ago that are higher than what we are having now. And this is going to come and go as time goes on a.k.a. cyclical. Woman 50s Coastal Florida A few interviewees pointed to their own experiences with weather as evidence of the Earth s natural cycles. As one woman put it  I just don t think that there s any evidence. I mean I don t see where anything has changed throughout my life. The summers aren t hotter. It s just not any different. Show me where the changes are. I think that the planet goes through a continual cycle anyways. I don t think it s more drastic than any other change the planet s gone through. Woman 40s Mountain West A common theme in these responses was that humans have played a small role if any in contributing to climate change. And because these changes are seen as natural humans cannot prevent climate change. These explanations downplayed the role humans have on the climate and emphasized the patterns of warming and cooling that have happened throughout the planet s history.  What I m skeptical on is what the source of the change is. I do believe it is changing but I believe it is changing in a natural cycle that happens all the time. What I don t believe is that humans are 100 responsible for climate change and thus humans are 100 able to fix the problem. Man 50s Mountain West  I think that there s climate change but I think this planet is I don t know how many millions if not billions of years old and that s just probably a cycle that it goes through. I think humans probably have a very very minor part of it but it is also just things out of our control. Man 40s Southwest When asked whether society should take steps to address climate change one interviewee emphasized that this issue is out of humans control saying  Take steps? No because I don t really know what step they could take. I don t see anything that people society can do to change the weather and change how the climate is going to react. I feel like that s all earthly and there s nothing that us humans and society can do to change that. Woman 30s Coastal Florida The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events are linked to climate change. Our past research has found that large majorities of Americans who have experienced extreme weather say that climate change contributed at least a little. In contrast to national opinion most interviewees in these discussions did not see extreme weather as connected to climate change. Instead participants explained extreme weather events in a similar way as climate change These are natural events the Earth has always experienced. One man pointed to the history of extreme weather events happening as proof that they are not happening more frequently now.  I think we do have spikes where we have just a ridiculous number of hurricanes or drought or snowstorms. But I think if you look back through history we ve had significant weather events since the dawn of time. So do they happen? Yes. Are we causing them to happen more frequently? No. Man 50s Mountain West Another man expressed a similar idea explaining that because these events have always happened he doesn t believe they are becoming more intense.  I think there s been extreme weather events since the beginning of time. There s been hurricanes tornados all that. I just don t buy into the fact that they re getting worse Man 50s Coastal Florida Interviewees tended to say that extreme weather events have not become more common due to climate change. Some said these events might seem like they are happening more frequently because of the availability of information but that they are not actually more common.  I think it s about the same. I think people are a little bit more aware of things happening. If there s a freeze in Dallas Texas as an example I can know about it within seconds. I just log into my anything and I can see breaking news. I just think it s been happening for so long that people now think that if it happens it s something rare. Man 40s Southwest One man said that extreme weather is not becoming more frequent pointing to the consistency of some events like hurricanes happening during certain seasons each year.  I m thinking with hurricanes they always happen in the same kind of interval. I don t think it s gotten any quicker and I haven t read any articles or information that convinces me that they re more common or it s linked to humancaused climate change. Man 20s Midwest The most skeptical interviewees two out of 32 dismissed climate change as entirely false and explained the discussion of climate change as rooted in political motivations.  Climate change is a hoax. It s what politicians want people to believe. And if they want to do anything about it in educating people then truly put statistical actual data together and show how climate change and environmental changes have affected us as human beings. Woman 50s Coastal Florida  I think it s a hoax. I think it s a joke. I mean I just think like I said it s been politicized through the roof. I don t know. It s kind of funny when you think about it that people are so ignorant and so gullible. Woman 40s Mountain West Many interviewees explained that hearing other people state the potentially catastrophic impacts of climate change caused them to be skeptical of whether climate change is actually something to be concerned about. For example claims that climate change threatens human lives were often labeled as alarmist and seen as pushing an agenda. Participants were especially skeptical of the ways politicians could benefit if they frame climate change as a topic that must be addressed. One approach aimed at motiving people to take action on climate change describing it as a crisis and emphasizing its potentially catastrophic impacts appears to be having the opposite effect on at least some parts of the population. Several interviewees said messages emphasizing the dire outcomes of climate change make them feel even more skeptical about the issue. Instead of motivating action it sowed deeper distrust. The interviewees who expressed frustration with the way those urging action on climate change discuss the issue felt there are people who talk about climate change with a level of concern unsupported by evidence. One woman emphasized the uncertainty around future impacts of climate change.  We don t know that there s going to be major climate change in the next few years or the next few months. It s kind of more of a guess a hypothetical thing so I feel like people are making a big deal out of it when really in all actuality no one knows what s going to happen long term. It s kind of just guessing and theories but no one knows. Woman 30s Coastal Florida Others said their perception of hyperbole or exaggeration around climate claims lead them to take a more skeptical view.  People who are alarmist tend to want really drastic policies that seem to not make sense so it kind of makes me disbelieve the other things they re saying. Man 20s Midwest  From a personal standpoint whether it s the climate or anything else when the statements are too large like when the statements are The world is getting warmer and Earth is going to be ended in five years because we re all terrible humans and we throw trash on the ground. Those things cause me to be instead of causing me to be concerned it causes me to be more skeptical about where the information is coming from and why it s being presented in such a grandiose term for lack of a better word. Woman 30s Midwest Some acknowledged the Earth is warming but still viewed the urgency and severity of some climate change messages as extreme.  Are we gradually getting warmer? Yes but I don t think we re all going to die in 30 years. And also some of the policies that we re trying to change within the next 1015 years it s not that drastic I don t believe. Man 30s South One man saw politicians pushing alarmist views and described a specific example of what he saw as an extreme view being untrue.  I just was watching old footage from 2009 of John Kerry and other senators. They stated by 2014 which is 10 years ago by 2013 2014 that there would not be one polar icecap left in the world. Well that s a lie and so I think that that s been forced down our throat. I mean the American people over time have been lied to. Man 50s Southwest Some interviewees said elected officials push climate change as an important topic for their own political and financial benefits.  I think for political reasons it s probably made into a bigger reason than it isn t. And then I also know that there s billions if not more of money to be made in that industry in those sectors when it comes to solar and energy efficiency and emissions and all of these different control factors. It makes sense to fight for something if you have the possibility to have your pocket in something that s a billion dollar industry if not more. Man 40s Southwest Another man expressed a similar idea and gave an example of climate change being used as a talking point to help candidates get elected.  I think that politicians have said that they have those extreme views to get popularity or financial gain from such things. Next year we have a presidential election. I think that is going to be one key speaking point. Now do I agree that it should be top two or three? No but it is going to be pushed and that next selection is going to have a major role in what we do as a country to limit our contributions to global warming. Man 30s South Climate scientists have been at the center of discussions over evidence that the Earth is warming and projections about the future effects climate change could cause. Interviewees expressed respect for the expertise of climate scientists while also raising the need to scrutinize their motivations. Overall participants were more open to hearing from climate scientists than news media who they see as largely biased and untrustworthy. Those who saw climate scientists as trustworthy sources for climate change information mentioned their expertise and subject knowledge as reasons to trust them as a source. When asked how she would feel about scientists presenting information about climate change one woman said  I would feel positive because I know they re specialists in it. They specialize in that so I would listen to them over just a normal person telling me something. Woman 40s South However for many trust in scientists was not absolute. One man said that he would listen to scientists about climate change as long as they were unbiased emphasizing their value as experts.  I d like to see reputable scientists or a group of scientists that are nonpolitical come out and be the sole voice of whatever it is. I ll take the good. I ll take the bad. I just don t want to hear people talk about it that are not experts in the field. Man 50s Mountain West Others also expressed limits to their trust in climate scientists raising questions about their motivations. These questions focused on scientists financial or political biases as reasons they do not fully trust them for information on climate change.  I have a lot of confidence in a lot of scientists. My concern is when science is met with ideology. If you ve got somebody who is ideological one way or the other. Statistics can be changed. Science can be written to have the results you want because of your ideology. I have great confidence in science. I have less confidence in people who are driven by ideology. It s just when people are trying to push an agenda. That s when I m skeptical. Man 50s Coastal Florida When asked how much confidence he has in scientists one man said  A fair amount of confidence. Absolute confidence? Probably not. A fair amount of confidence? Yes because they are studying it. They are in the field. They know the data. But at the same point they are human they re going to be biased to whoever is funding their research. They don t want to bite the hand that feeds them and provide data that is going to contradict what the agency s trying to push out. I would say they have a fair amount of confidence but you have to be still skeptical. Man 30s Coastal Florida Analyses of scientific publications show widespread agreement among climate scientists that human activity is the primary cause of climate change. Yet some interviewees said they wanted to hear from a variety of scientists to be able to get a balanced view of multiple opinions within the scientific community.  I also like to hear what the other scientists say as well because scientists have different approaches at things. They have different ways of thinking. Man 50s Coastal Florida For another man multiple voices in the scientific community caused him confusion about the truth.  There s scientists that are so far apart from each other there s a group that are like Oh the world s going to burn up. The core temperature is rising and then there s another side that says We ve already started being on the downside of cooling off. It couldn t be more polar opposite so who do you believe? Man 50s Southwest A 2022 Pew Research Center survey found that 23 of Americans say they have little or no trust in climate scientists to provide full and accurate information on climate change. Another 22 say they have some trust in climate scientists. At the other end of the spectrum 54 of Americans say they have either a great deal or quite a bit of trust in information from climate scientists. Distrust in information from climate scientists is most widespread among those who do not see a strong link between human activity and climate change. For example 43 of those who say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of natural patterns in the environment say they have a little or no trust in climate scientists to give full and accurate information. And 67 of those who say there is no evidence that the Earth is warming hold the lowest level of trust in climate scientists. The openness to hearing from scientists was in stark contrast to how interviewees talked about the news media. Participants were much more dismissive of information from media organizations. Most of the 32 participants described climate information from the media as biased and untrustworthy. Some said the media outlets are motivated more by profit than a goal to accurately report information. As one man put it  Networks and radio and newspapers and television they re all getting paid to tell me something. And if they don t have my attention then they re not getting paid. So they ll do whatever they need to get my attention. So they will stretch things. I m sure that in the past they ve made up stories or you know make you try to feel something that s not necessarily important or whatnot. It s all about ratings and getting people to watch. Man 40s South Another felt that the information news media publish is selected to appeal to their audience and is therefore untrustworthy.  Any mainstream news organization they re going to have their bias they all have their narrative that they re pushing for their own quote unquote customer base where they can market to. I don t necessarily trust anything that they post. Man 30s Coastal Florida Interviewees pointed out that they don t trust news sources regardless of the outlet s political leaning. For them news sources are not trusted authorities on the topic of climate change. One man drew on his own work experience of analyzing data as a reason to be skeptical of these sources.  When it comes from media sources it s just hard to believe when they post things because a lot of times they post it as factual when it s opinion pieces. It s just journalists who are not experts in that field of work and they re just kind of giving their this is what we think. And we all know that at least in my line of business that we can look at statistics. We can look at data. We can kind of give a story around particular data points even if they re not the right ones. So I definitely don t trust media sources from either side. Man 40s Southwest Another man said media outlets have a bias one way or the other and feature viewpoints he considers extreme which causes him to be disengaged.  There aren t very many media outlets that are really truly in the middle anymore. So you have to listen and the turnoff is you get the extreme people and that turns you off from wanting to really listen to the whole story. Man 50s Coastal Florida The interviews explored views of government policies meant to limit the effects of climate change by encouraging a renewable energy transition and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles. The Biden administration has invested in developing more renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power as a path to address climate change. The Inflation Reduction Act passed last August also included incentives for Americans to make their homes more energy efficient and to purchase electric vehicles. Some interviewees were open to the idea of a renewable energy transition but called for a slower pace of change. Others expressed outright opposition to a move away from fossil fuels saying that renewable energy is not reliable. Concerns with electric vehicles EVs were front of mind for many interviewees when discussing renewable energy. Interviewees saw potential problems ranging from environmental damage due to EV manufacturing to practical challenges involved in owning an EV. A recent Center survey found that the share of the public interested in an EV purchase has fallen slightly over the past year and many Americans lack confidence that the U.S. will build the charging infrastructure needed to support large numbers of EVs. For more on these findings see our recent post How Americans view electric vehicles.  Many interviewees emphasized that a transition toward a greater reliance on renewable energy sources must unfold gradually. Economic decline was a common concern with a fastpaced transition.  I m fine with the change. What I m not fine with are the demands and the urgency to change which then has a major impact on the economy. Man 50s Mountain West  I think we re so reliant on carbonbased fuels for our economy and the way we live. We have to cripple ourselves to switch over. It would have to take 40 50 years reasonably to do that so if we re going to ban gas cars by 2035 I think it is too excessive. Man 20s Midwest  I have nothing whatsoever against renewable energies. I m just I would be my concern is the pace. The pace at which we re going. Man 30s Southwest Other interviewees were more strongly opposed to renewable energy sources raising concerns about the functionality of renewables. These interviewees commonly expressed strong support for the continued or expanded use of fossil fuels.  We don t have all the batteries to make the electric cars. Things like that. I don t see where that s an improvement. I think that fossil fuels have gotten us this far and I think that they re fine. Woman 40s Mountain West One man living in Florida expressed his skepticism about relying too heavily on electricity particularly in the aftermath of natural disasters.  I think to try to switch from one to the next is way too much of a burden too unfeasible and would be too costly for the averageday person that it s just not realistic to say in 10 years let s just have all electric everything. That s a terrible idea especially here in Florida with hurricanes. The power goes out. If everything s electricity then what are you going to do? Man 30s Coastal Florida Interviewees often used electric vehicles as an example to express their concerns with or opposition to renewable energy. Interviewees with concerns about electric vehicles mentioned environmental harm from EV batteries and the practical challenges of owning an EV.  I think that with everything that s in place over the last five years and there s good and bad so all these people again no one s addressing the electric car in the energy and the minerals it depletes from the Earth. That s an environmental issue. Man 50s Southwest Relatedly many said EVs are no better for the environment than gaspowered vehicles or were unsure whether EVs are an improvement.  If you talk to people about switching to electric cars versus diesel or gaspowered cars you re going to hear a lot of talking about how electric powered vehicles still produce a lot of waste that they re not as reliable that they re more expensive. Those are the questions that we ve got and I think they re valid questions because sometimes alternatives are not always better and we know that producing electricity is probably going to produce waste no matter what unless we switch to a windpowered society or something. Woman 20s Southwest Many pointed to the lack of infrastructure and challenges with home charging as barriers to owning EVs.  It s not practical for everyone to purchase a Tesla or be able to have the ability to plug in a car at their home or to quite frankly pay to charge up a car and have an additional expense or additional changes to their lifestyle that is always productive or applicable. Woman 30s Midwest  The infrastructure isn t there quite yet just because I ve also heard that there s not a lot of places to recharge your car or the amount of time that it takes to recharge your car takes longer than expected of course much longer than just going to a local gas station and filling up your gas. I think having creating that infrastructure not just saying we need more vehicles but OK what does that mean how do we get there so that also we want to have an electric vehicle? Woman 30s Midwest Overall 38 of Americans say they would be very or somewhat likely to consider an electric vehicle the next time they purchase a car or truck 50 say they would be unlikely to consider an EV. On balance Americans have doubts that the country is likely to build the infrastructure needed to support large numbers of electric vehicles though adults who are most optimistic about the infrastructure are among the most likely to say they d consider buying an EV. Americans are cool to the idea of ending the production of gaspowered vehicles. About sixinten say they oppose phasing out the production of new gasoline cars and trucks by 2035. In addition more say they would feel upset 45 than excited 21 if new gaspowered vehicles were phased out. For more on Americans views of electric vehicles read this post. While the participants in this study all placed lower importance on taking action to address climate change they shared an openness to some types of government action on the environment particularly at the local level. Specifically support for efforts to protect natural lands and waterways came up in multiple conversations. However interviewees commonly raised caution that government regulations should not limit people s freedoms restrict individual choice or burden people financially. For views on these issues among all U.S. adults read our companion report Majorities of Americans Prioritize Renewable Energy Back Steps to Address Climate Change.  One interviewee said government programs should provide a way for individuals to help the environment on their own.  I think they should provide the ability to help. Recycle reuse. We re fortunate here. Our government does multiple times a year they give out trees. So you can plant a new tree in your yard and help with the CO2 in the air that does help our environment as we plant trees. Woman 50s Coastal Florida Another expressed a similar sentiment about the government providing individuals with incentives to protect the environment.  I feel like maybe government if they put an incentive on recycling like say you recycle this much a month or something if they give an incentive to things like maybe get a discount on your electricity bill or something like that I think that would give people more motive and give them an enticement to do better in regards to protecting their environment. Woman 30s Coastal Florida A common call across interviews was for actions to protect natural lands and waterways. Some of these pertained to specific regional issues such as preserving water in Arizona and protecting waterways around Florida.  No I don t think enough is being done when it comes to water scarcity. I think there s a bigger focus on trying to control other things. I m not sure if you re familiar with the Phoenix area but there s a lot of foreign companies that are buying out farmlands and drilling for water to take and growing alfalfa to take to other countries. We allow other countries to come into this country and use up a really important resource here in the desert. The government s doing absolutely nothing about that but they re trying to tell us what type of cars to drive. It just makes no sense. You can t survive without water. Man 40s Southwest  Off the top of my head I know that there are environmental challenges at Biscayne Bay here in Miami it s one of the bigger bays. It is having a lot of environmental issues I do know that it is a concern for the community because that s a whole ecosystem where fish and wildlife they live there. We live there as well but it s a big ecosystem. It seems to be being very impacted by pollution and what humans are doing to the area. Also making sure that the Everglades stays clean. It s an important aspect to being a Floridian because the Everglades is a big part of Florida. A local aquifer system where the water pumps down and we want to make sure that that stays clean because if we have polluted water that s not good for anybody. Man 30s Coastal Florida More general concerns were over preserving natural lands. Interviewees mentioned limiting development to ensure that natural habitats could survive.  I believe in the theory of habitat where your land can only sustain with X amount of people or animals. You can apply it anywhere. If you have too many people in one area then the habitat cannot sustain it thus the environment starts to suffer. You can see that in any of the major cities. Man 50s Mountain West  I think it s very important to not overdevelop so there s still space for natural habitats so animals like foxes and predators don t start going onto people s homes and businesses. To have more plants and trees more biodiversity is very important. Man 20s Midwest In interviews the most widespread support for environmental regulation came on the topic of ensuring that individuals and corporations were not harming the environment. Still openness to government action was tempered by the preference that it not go too far.  I think the government likes to get their hands on everything. But obviously if there are things that are illegal like dumping oil in the ocean or throwing your trash in the rivers there should be consequences for stuff like that. It s affecting all of us. Woman 40s Mountain West  I think we should conserve where we can. I think we should protect endangered species do some of the things we are doing but I don t think that includes eliminating fossil fuels or anything like that. I don t think it means regulating people s homes or anything like that. I do think what big industry puts into the air should be at least monitored and somewhat controlled but I don t think it should be completely restricted. Woman 40s Mountain West Interviewees wanted to make sure government policies for addressing climate change and protecting the environment are effective and cost taxpayers little.  I think that government should set up guidelines and try and help steer people in the right direction but as far as what they do I don t know about writing a blank check. If there s going to be a financial burden on people I would really need to see what the benefit is going to be at the end of that whether the people are going to essentially be taxed for it or how much they re going to get taxed for it and what s the impact going to happen to the environment. Man 30s Coastal Florida Interviewees also prioritized ensuring that policies do not limit individuals freedoms.  I don t think they need to be so heavyhanded. I do like the idea of incentives for sure I don t know if people take advantage of them. I d like to see some incentives more incentives less heavyhanded. I m trying to think of ways they could do it without pissing off people like business owners like ourselves. Woman 50s Mountain West  I think the best way to protect the environment is just educating people on what steps we can take that aren t extreme meaning don t ban gas combustion vehicles. Don t ban gas stoves. Give people the information. Let them decide what they want to do. But when you start to force things upon people that s when people become skeptical as well. It s like why are they forcing something on to us? Why are they changing laws? Man 40s Southwest When asked what individuals themselves should do to address climate change and environmental problems interviewees pointed to recycling and reducing waste as a way to take personal responsibility.  Best ways to protect the environment I think is to reduce reuse recycle. Man 30s Mountain West  Whether it be less pollution more recycling landfills are full with stuff it shouldn t be full with. We should learn how to reuse the resources we already have instead of trying to make more harmful resources. Woman 30s Midwest  And it is so very important that we take care of our planet. Let s not litter. Let s have good clean water. Let s not do anything that s going to hurt our planet that we live in. Man 50s Coastal Florida Interviewees generally expressed the view that government policies to address climate change and protect the environment are better suited for local and state governments than the federal government. Many viewed these levels of government as being closer to the issues and therefore better equipped to create policy.  I think the local government would have more effect on the citizens here in Idaho than the federal level. I feel like a lot of people don t trust the federal level as much here. We need to be responsible for where we live. So it would be all hands on deck for this region. If it s national it s less personal. Woman 40s Mountain West  I think the state government officials they re going to be more in tune with the issues of the area. Going federal I think that s too far out. I think they just may be too far removed from any possible issues from the community itself to understand the difficulties that that community might face and the issues.
