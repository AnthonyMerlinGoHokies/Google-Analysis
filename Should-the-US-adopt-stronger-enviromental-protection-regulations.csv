https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2018/05/14/majorities-see-government-efforts-to-protect-the-environment-as-insufficient/, Brian van der BrugLos Angeles Times via Getty ImagesMajorities of Americans say the federal government is doing too little to protect key aspects of the environment including water 69 and air quality 64. And twothirds of Americans 67 say the government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change. These findings come after a year of change in climate and energy regulatory policies under the Trump administration. At the same time Americans are closely divided 52 to 48 over whether or not it is possible to cut back on regulations while still effectively protecting air and water quality. There are wide political divides on this issue with roughly threequarters of Republicans 74 including independents who lean Republican convinced this is possible but 64 of Democrats including Democraticleaning independents convinced it is not possible. The national survey by Pew Research Center conducted March 27April 9 among 2541 adults finds pockets of partisan agreement over expanding solar and wind power though wide political divides remain over increasing fossil fuels through such methods as coal mining hydraulic fracturing and offshore drilling for oil and natural gas a pattern consistent with a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. Further a majority of Americans support a range of energy policy priorities including protecting the environment from the effects of energy development and use 72 and increasing reliance on renewable energy sources 71 as well as reducing dependence on foreign energy sources 69 and keeping consumer energy costs low 66. More Democrats and Democraticleaning independents give priority to protecting the environment as well as increasing reliance on renewable energy sources a larger share of Republicans and independents who lean to the GOP put priority on reducing U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources. Consistent with past studies Republicans and Democrats remain divided over whether the Earth is warming and the importance of human activity in the process. The new survey finds threequarters of Democrats and Democratic leaners believe the Earth is warming primarily due to human causes compared with 26 among their Republican counterparts. Similarly Democrats are much more likely than are Republicans to express concern about the issue of climate change and to see at least some effects of global warming in their local community or in their own lives. There are wide political divides over the consequences of policies aimed at climate change that hold even among those who agree that the Earth has been warming. Most Republicans are skeptical about whether in general policies aimed at reducing climate change benefit the environment 72 of Republicans and Republican leaners say these policies either make no difference or do more harm than good and 57 think such policies harm the economy. For their part about twothirds of Democrats 66 including leaners think that such policies will help the environment and most see either no harm 39 or net benefits for the economy 45 from such policies. When asked about specific proposals to reduce climate change most Democrats 90 and smaller majorities of Republicans 65 say that restrictions on power plant emissions would make a difference in reducing climate change as would tax incentives encouraging businesses to reduce their carbon emissions 85 and 65 respectively. Republicans particularly conservative Republicans are less convinced that tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles or tax incentives to encourage more individuals to drive hybrid and electric cars will make a difference in reducing climate change. Opinion about one new approach on the horizon solar geoengineering which seeks to lower the Earth s temperature through broadbased changes to the atmosphere divides strongly along political lines. About eightinten conservative Republicans 78 say solar geoengineering would not make a difference in reducing climate change while 64 of liberal Democrats say it would. Fourinten Democrats 40 and about half of Republicans 54 express concern that such approaches would do more harm than good for the environment however. Generational differences emerge on some energy and climate issues but such differences occur primarily among Republicans not Democrats. Republican Millennials are less inclined than their elders in the GOP to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. For example 75 of Republicans in the Baby Boomer and older generations support the increased use of offshore drilling compared with 44 of Millennial Republicans. Among Democrats there are no more than modest differences by generation on beliefs about these climate and energy issues. During the first year of the Trump administration the Environmental Protection Agency has rolled back more than 30 environmental regulations and it recently announced a plan to lower carbon emissions standards on automobiles. Amid these changes Americans are divided on whether it is possible to cut regulations while still effectively protecting air and water quality with 52 saying it is possible and 48 saying it is not. Some 74 of Republicans and independents who lean Republican believe it is possible to cut regulations and protect the quality of air and water compared with 35 of Democrats and Democratic leaners who say the same. More specifically majorities of Americans say the federal government is doing too little to protect water quality 69 air quality 64 animals and their habitats 63 or open lands in national parks 57. Also twothirds of U.S. adults 67 say the government is not doing enough to reduce the effects of global climate change. Only about oneinfive Americans 19 say government officials are doing about the right amount to deal with climate change with another 13 saying too much is being done. Political leanings have a profound influence on how Americans view government activity. Roughly nineinten liberal Democrats believe the federal government is not doing enough to protect key aspects of the environment such as air 89 and water quality 91. By contrast minorities of conservative Republicans believe the government is doing too little in these areas. For instance 89 of liberal Democrats say the federal government isn t doing enough to protect air quality compared with just 26 of conservative Republicans who say the same. When it comes to water quality of lakes rivers and streams 91 of Democrats say the federal government isn t doing enough compared with 39 of conservative Republicans. Conservative Republicans about half of them say the government is doing about the right amount to safeguard these aspects of the environment. A smaller share says the government is doing too much to protect air 18 or water quality 14. Moderate or liberal Republicans are more likely than their conservative counterparts to say that the federal government s environmental efforts are insufficient. For instance 63 of moderate or liberal Republicans believe the government is doing too little to protect the water quality of lakes rivers and streams compared with 39 of conservative Republicans who say the same. Separate Pew Research Center surveys found a 15percentagepoint decline between 2015 and 2017 in Americans overall ratings of how well the federal government is protecting the environment. Views of government performance in this area shifted among both Republicans and Democrats. Strong majorities of Americans believe the top priorities for U.S. energy policy should be protecting the environment from energy development and use 72 increasing reliance on renewable energy sources 71 or reducing U.S. dependence on foreign energy sources 69. Majorities of Americans also say that keeping energy prices low 66 or creating jobs within the energy sector 58 should be top priorities. As is often the case with issues related to energy and the environment there is a partisan divide over how best to prioritize U.S. energy goals. Strong majorities of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents believe the top priorities should be protecting the environment from the effects of energy development and use 83 or increasing America s reliance on renewable energy sources 80 compared with 56 of Republicans and Republican leaners who say the same about protecting the environment from the effects of energy development and 59 who would prioritize renewable energy sources. Eightinten 80 Republicans and Republican leaners believe a top objective of U.S. energy policy should be reducing dependence on foreign energy sources a view shared by 61 of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents. The two parties tend to agree on the relative importance of economic issues when considering energy policies with 56 of Democrats and 59 and Republicans saying that creating jobs within the energy sector should be a top priority and 61 and 71 respectively saying the U.S. should focus most on keeping consumer energy prices low. Liberal Democrats are less likely to give top priority to maintaining low energy prices 49 than moderate or conservative Democrats 72. The views of moderate or conservative Democrats are nearly the same on this issue as moderate or liberal Republicans 69 and conservative Republicans 72. Around threefourths of Americans 76 are aware that U.S. energy production has increased over the past 20 years. And large majorities of Americans favor expanding at least two types of renewable sources to provide energy solar panel 89 and wind turbine 85 facilities. Fewer than half of Americans support more hydraulic fracturing or fracking 39 offshore oil and gas drilling 39 or coal mining 37 44 support more nuclear power plants. These figures are in keeping with the findings of a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. Robust support for expanding solar and wind power represents a rare point of bipartisan consensus in how the U.S. views energy policies. Both conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats for instance strongly favor the expansion of solar panel farms 80 and 96 respectively and wind turbine farms 71 and 93 respectively. However the political gap over fossil fuels remains vast with 73 of conservative Republicans and 16 of liberal Democrats favoring more offshore drilling 70 and 13 respectively supporting more coal mining and 67 and 17 respectively in favor of expanded fracking. Moderate or liberal Republicans tend to be more divided than their conservative counterparts over fossil fuels. For example 49 of this group favors more offshore drilling for oil and natural gas while 50 oppose it. The political divide over nuclear energy a carbonneutral technology is less pronounced than it is over fossil fuels 57 of conservative Republicans support the expansion of nuclear power plants versus 38 of liberal Democrats. In keeping with previous Pew Research Center surveys women tend to be less supportive of expanding nuclear power than men even after controlling for political party. Some 35 of women favor and 63 oppose more nuclear power plants. Men are more closely divided on this issue 53 favor and 46 oppose. Political divides over expanding the use of offshore drilling hydraulic fracturing and nuclear power are consistent with past Pew Research Center surveys using somewhat different question wording and polling methods. See the Appendix. While there is wide support for the expansion of solar and wind power Americans are divided over the most effective way to promote wider adoption of renewable energy sources. On balance most U.S. adults 56 agree with the statement Government regulations are necessary to encourage businesses and consumers to rely more on renewable energy sources. Meanwhile 42 back the statement The private marketplace will ensure that businesses and consumers rely more on renewable energy sources even without government regulations.  Views on this question are strongly aligned with partisan affiliation. While 72 of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents say that government regulations are necessary to promote adoption of renewable energy sources 65 of Republicans and Republican leaners say the private marketplace can accomplish that goal without government regulations. These findings are in keeping with a 2017 Pew Research Center report which used slightly different question wording and methods. Threequarters of Americans believe global climate change has at least some effect on the U.S. today and about sixinten 59 believe climate change has at least some effect on their local community the new survey finds. On balance most Americans believe it is possible to reduce the effects of climate change and about half say that policy efforts to diminish those effects have a net benefit for the environment. However views on how such policies impact the economy are mixed with roughly even shares saying these policies have a net positive net negative and no effect on the economy. There are wide partisan differences on climate issues as has been found in more than a decade of surveys. Political divides are found in issues ranging from what drives climate change to how policies aimed at climate change reduction will affect the environment and the economy. Some 53 of Americans say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity such as burning fossil fuels roughly threeinten 29 say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of natural patterns in the Earth s environment and another 17 say there is no solid evidence of warming. The share of adults saying human activity is the primary cause of climate change is similar to a 2016 Pew Research Center survey in which 48 of Americans said that the Earth is warming mostly due to human activity. There are wide differences in beliefs about climate change by politics. About eightinten liberal Democrats 83 say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity. In contrast 18 of conservative Republicans say this a difference of 65 percentage points. Some 46 of conservative Republicans say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of natural patterns and 36 say there is no solid evidence of warming. While previous Pew Research Center surveys have asked about this issue using somewhat different question wording and polling methods over time surveys since 2006 have found wide political differences in public views about climate change and the role of human activity. See the Appendix. Americans were also asked what they understand to be the view of most climate scientists on climate change. Twothirds of adults think most climate scientists say the Earth is getting warmer mostly because of human activity while much smaller shares think most climate scientists point to natural causes to explain the Earth getting warmer 17 or say there is no solid evidence the Earth is warming 16. Several analyses of scholarly publications suggest widespread agreement among climate scientists that human activity is the primary cause of climate change.1 Similarly a Pew Research Center survey of members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science AAAS found 93 of members with a Ph.D. in Earth sciences and 87 of all members say the Earth is warming mostly due to human activity. 2 Pew Research Center has asked Americans about their perception of the scientific consensus on climate change in different ways over the years. For example in a 2016 survey Americans were asked what share of climate scientists say human behavior is mostly responsible for global climate change. Some 27 said almost all climate scientists think human behavior is mostly responsible for climate change and 35 said more than half. 3 People s political orientations are strongly related to their perception of the scientific consensus on climate change.4 In this survey a strong majority of liberal Democrats 88 say most climate scientists think the Earth is warming due to human activity. By comparison 40 of conservative Republicans say most climate scientists think the Earth is warming due to human activity. Among conservative Republicans 40 say most climate scientists think human behavior is the primary cause of climate change but just half that share 18 hold this as their personal belief on climate change. Roughly threequarters of Americans 76 say climate change is currently affecting the U.S. either a great deal 40 or some 35. And roughly sixinten 59 think climate change is affecting their local community either a great deal 22 or some 37. Those who perceived at least some effect of climate change in their local community were asked to consider if climate change has had a personal impact in their lives. Overall about threeinten U.S. adults 31 say the local effects are directly affecting their personal lives. Respondents who said climate change has affected their community were then asked how they felt their local area was affected. They were particularly likely to mention changes in the weather including increasing frequency of severe storms droughts floods and wildfires 45 of those asked. Other responses to this openended question included damage to plants animals and the landscape 12 of those asked and effects on human health and local infrastructure 6 of those asked. Among the general public perceptions of whether and how much climate change is affecting their local community are tied to political party and ideology. For example 83 of liberal Democrats say climate change is affecting their local community at least some and almost half 48 say the effects of climate change are impacting them personally. By contrast about onequarter 27 of conservative Republicans say climate change is affecting their local community and 13 say climate change is impacting them personally. Even among those who say the Earth is warming Republicans are less inclined than Democrats to see climate change affecting their local community. When it comes to policies aimed at reducing the effects of global climate change about half of U.S. adults 49 believe these policies have net benefits for the environment. Threeinten say these policies make no difference for the environment and about twointen 19 believe these policies end up doing more harm than good for the environment. As with other climate issues there are sizable political divides over the effects of climate policies. About eightinten liberal Democrats 78 say climate change policies do more good than harm compared with 56 of moderate or conservative Democrats. Republicans are more inclined to believe such policies have little impact or bring net harm to the environment. Among conservative Republicans about half 48 say these policies make no difference and threeinten 31 say these policies do more harm than good for the environment. Americans tend to be more skeptical of what effects climate change policies have on the economy. Some 30 of Americans say climate change policies help the U.S. economy while a roughly equal share 31 believes these policies generally hurt the economy. Another 36 say policies to reduce the effects of global climate change generally make no difference to the U.S. economy. Conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats are at odds on this question. A majority of conservative Republicans 66 say these policies generally hurt the U.S. economy compared with just oneinten liberal Democrats 11. And while about half of liberal Democrats 53 say climate change policies help the economy only 8 of conservative Republicans say the same. Most Americans 68 are generally optimistic that it is possible to reduce the effects of climate change while 31 say otherwise. And majorities of Americans believe each of the four policy proposals considered in this survey would make a difference in reducing the effects of climate change. For instance 79 of Americans say that restrictions on power plant emissions can make a difference in reducing the effects of global climate change. Threequarters of U.S. adults 76 say corporate tax incentives to encourage carbon emission reductions among businesses can make a difference and roughly seveninten 71 say the same about tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks. Americans are somewhat less optimistic about tax incentives to encourage more people to drive hybrid and electric cars. About sixinten 62 think this would make a difference in reducing the effects of global climate change. Conservative Republicans are less likely than other political groups to think each of these proposals can make a difference in reducing the effects of climate change. For example 36 of conservative Republicans say tax incentives for people to drive hybrid and electric cars would impact climate change. By comparison a majority of moderate or liberal Republicans 63 and 73 of Democrats say this proposal would make a difference. Those who think climate change is the result of human activity or that it is possible to reduce the effects of climate change are also particularly likely to say each of these specific proposals can make a difference. Researchers and policymakers are also considering the possibility of altering aspects of the environment to reduce the effects of climate change a technique called geoengineering. Solar geoengineering for instance would spread particles in the atmosphere to reflect some incoming sunlight decreasing the amount absorbed by the Earth and thereby cooling the planet. The Pew Research Center survey asked Americans whether they think solar geoengineering would make a difference in reducing the effects of climate change and what effects they believe these techniques will have on the environment overall. In contrast to public views on other specific policy proposals opinion is closely divided 45 to 52 over whether solar geoengineering would make a difference in reducing the effects of climate change. Opinion on this issue is closely aligned with political affiliation. About twothirds of liberal Democrats 64 say these techniques would make a difference while a large majority of conservative Republicans 78 think they would not. Some 45 of the public believes solar geoengineering would bring net harm to the environment however. Threeinten U.S. adults think these techniques would bring net benefits to the environment and 22 say they would have little effect on the environment. Compared with other climate and energy issues there are relatively modest political differences in views about solar geoengineering s impact on the environment. Generational differences emerge on some energy and climate issues but such differences occur primarily among Republicans not Democrats. Republican Millennials are less inclined than their elders in the GOP to support increased use of fossil fuel energy sources through such methods as offshore drilling hydraulic fracturing and coal mining. For example 44 of Millennial Republicans support the increased use of offshore drilling compared with 75 of Republicans in the Baby Boomer and older generations. Millennials in the GOP are more likely than their elders to say the Earth is warming due to human activity consistent with a 2017 Pew Research Center survey that used somewhat different question wording. This group is also more likely than older generations in the GOP to perceive at least some effects of climate change in the communities where they live. However Republicans across all generations are largely in agreement over the consequences of policies aimed at reducing climate change. For example roughly 44 of Republicans say policies aimed at reducing the effects of climate change will make no difference for the environment and around a quarter believe such policies do more harm than good. Among Democrats there are no more than modest differences by generation on beliefs about these climate and energy issues. Regardless of people s political leanings those who care a great deal about the issue of global climate change have strikingly different opinions than those who care less about this issue. Some 44 of Americans say they care a great deal about the issue of global climate change onethird 33 say they care some and 22 say they do not care much or at all. The segment that cares deeply about climate change is up slightly from 36 in 2016 the last time this question was asked. People who care deeply about the issue of climate change stand out for their near consensus that climate change is affecting the U.S. 96 and that policy proposals such as restrictions on carbon emissions from power plants 95 tougher fuelefficiency standards for cars 90 and corporate tax incentives to lower carbon emissions from businesses 90 can make a difference in reducing climate change. These patterns are consistent with analysis of a 2016 Pew Research Center survey. Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers
https://www.audubon.org/news/why-we-need-strong-epa,  Bald Eagles along the Anacostia River near Washington D.C. are better off today than in the 1960s. The Clean Water Act has reduced dumping of trash and wastewater into the river leading some to hope it will be swimmable and fishable in a decade. Photo Krista Schlyer Words by Hannah Waters Senior Editor Audubon magazine Published January 17 2017 If you re looking for an example of the way political debate warps reality you couldn t do much better than the recent treatment of the Environmental Protection Agency. Some politicians have made a hobby of attacking the agency not for its work in keeping our air and water clean but as a symbol for the government rules and regulations that they say strangle businesses and hinder the economy. That these arguments have had any political success even though environmental regulations cost less and have greater benefits than opponents claim demonstrates the effectiveness of the EPA s ongoing work Many parts of the country have far cleaner air and water than when the agency was founded in 1970 to enforce new environmental laws passed by Congress to protect people and wildlife from pollution. So much so that it s hard to recall what life was like before the EPA was founded when factories dumped waste directly into waterways and black smoke streamed from industrial stacks. But those successes don t matter to politicians devoted to antigovernment posturing no matter the cost. The billiondollar industries that donate to their campaigns thanks Citizens United want to be free of what they see as burdensome rules and regulations like cleaning up their hazardous waste or installing technologies to capture carbon pollution. In an ideal world the EPA wouldn t be necessary and companies would take responsibility for their own waste. But history has shown that as long as there s a buck to be made polluters will quietly poison our shared resources. Now those polluters could have their way Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt has been nominated to lead the EPA an agency he has sued repeatedly often with the cooperation of companies that funded his campaigns. In addition he doesn t believe the basic scientific facts of climate change or that it could be manmade.  Modern opponents of the EPA fail to remember or worse choose to ignore the good that the EPA has done. As a refresher here are just some of the ways the EPA has kept our drinking water clean our breathing air clear and the environment safe for birds and wildlife.  These two eagles found dead in 1963 were sent to a lab to test for harmful pesticides like DDT. Photo Seney Natural History Association In the 1960s birds became potent symbols of the way human industry infiltrated the environment and threatened human health. After World War II the use of the pesticide DDT became widespread in U.S. agriculture. Rainfall washed the pesticide from fields into streams where it was absorbed by plants and fish and then consumed by raptors and other birds. Bald Eagles that ingested DDT laid eggs with shells so weak that parents crushed them just by sitting on the nest. By 1963 less than 500 nesting pairs of Bald Eagles survived. After environmental scientist Rachel Carson publicized the effects of DDT in her 1962 book Silent Spring it wasn t hard for Americans to imagine the myriad health problems caused by blindly consuming the offerings of industry. Soon research proved that DDT causes cancer in people and persists in ecosystems for decades. In 1972 the EPA banned the pesticide. And within a few decades Bald Eagle populations and those of other affected species such as pelicans and falcons recovered. The EPA has worked to reduce levels of other environmental toxins too. Some of these such as lead and mercury occur naturally but are dangerous in high doses. Lead was used as an additive in paint gasoline pipes and other materials and causes brain damage developmental delays and even death in high doses in both people and birds. Meanwhile the neurotoxin mercury which is released to the air when fossil fuels are burned accumulates in muscle tissue allowing it to be passed up the food chain and can kill birds and wildlife and people too. After the EPA phased out leaded gasoline the number of American children with elevated lead levels in their blood dropped from 88 percent in the late 1970s to less than 1 percent today. And in 2011 the EPA published new standards to reduce mercury emissions from coal plants an effort that Scott Pruitt tried and failed to overturn. The standards are expected to prevent 11000 premature deaths 4700 heart attacks and 130000 childhood asthma attacks each year.  In the 1950s and 1960s people in Los Angeles breathed some of the dirtiest air in the world. Today thanks to the Clean Air Act its much cleaner although theres still more work to do. Photo Ramon PreciadoAlamy If you want a vision of what the United States might look like without the EPA you can look to China. This month smog a haze of pollution and fog so thick that it blocks sunlight has settled on Beijing and 24 other cities. The government has declared a national red alert schools are closed driving is restricted and factories are shut down. This happens year after year as Chinese leaders fail to enforce the environmental laws that would allow people to safely venture outdoors. Their situation doesn t look far off from the U.S. in the middle of the last century. Before companies that burned fossil fuels were required to install technologies to control soot and gas emissions from their smokestacks smog choked American cities causing a raft of chronic diseases and shortening the lives of many urban citizens. Birds and other wildlife suffer from similar respiratory problems when immersed in air pollution. It hurts their habitats too. Groundlevel ozone damages trees and plant communities while nitrogen oxides and sulfur oxides mix with water in the air better known as acid rain and in rivers to poison environments and kill plants and animals. Major amendments to the Clean Air Act passed by Congress in 1970 called on the newly formed EPA to set national standards for healthy levels of common air pollutants including those mentioned above. The agency helped states put together plans to reduce pollution from sources like cars power plants and other polluting industries by installing new technologies to capture particle pollution and dangerous gases and reduce emissions. As a result today s vehicles are 99 percent cleaner for common pollutants and new power plants are 90 percent cleaner for dangerous gases according to the EPA. Studies have also shown that the Clean Air Act saves hundreds of thousands of lives every year while saving Americans trillions of dollars in healthcare costs. In 1969 Cleveland caught the attention of the nation when an oil slick on the Cuyahoga River caught fire and became a symbol of the country s abundant water pollution. At the time factories regularly discharged pollution and sewage directly into rivers around 70 percent of which was completely untreated killing aquatic life and turning waterways into cesspools. Many lakes and rivers were ecologically dead and if you fell off a boat into most urban rivers you d need to go to the hospital to treat skin rashes and the pathogens you had surely just contracted. Outcry about water pollution led to the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972 and the EPA was charged with enforcing it. The act made it unlawful to dump pollution into navigable waters without a permit and sought to make all U.S. waters fishable and swimmable by 1985. The EPA set standards for how clean water should be and worked with local authorities and companies to design programs to clean wastewater redesign sewer systems and restore degraded rivers and lakes.  Last year the EPA reached a settlement with a Virginia electric utility to reduce pollution to the Anacostia River pictured here. Photo Krista Schlyer The act didn t achieve its goal by 1985. Indeed there is still work to be done but it did improve water quality in onethird of the country s waterways which speaks to the challenges of addressing water pollution. Part of the problem is that there aren t clear laws for pollution that comes from many sources such as oil spilled in the streets or pesticides washed from lawns. Another challenge is that for decades courts and politicians have argued over the definition of navigable waters and whether wetlands and streams near rivers and lakes should be protected under the Clean Water Act. Last year the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule that wetlands and streams are integral parts of waterways and so also fall under the purview of the Clean Water Act. This is one of the EPA policies that Scott Pruitt and the new administration has vowed to overturn a promise that threatens wetland habitat that birds and wildlife rely upon as feeding grounds during lengthy migrations and throughout the year. While black smoke is a rarer sight today than it was in 1970 not all pollution is visible to the human eye. Fossil fuelpowered industries continue to emit colorless greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. These pollutants prevent heat in our atmosphere from escaping to space and as a result the planet is warming and its climate is changing with dire consequences. Rising temperatures threaten the habitats birds need by redistributing their food and shelter while rising seas encroach inland and put wetlands and beaches at risk. In North America climate change threatens the survival of over 300 bird species according to Audubon scientists.  By the end of the century Minnesota will likely no longer host its iconic Common Loons in the summertime because of climate change. Photo Timothy LenahanAudubon Photography Awards In 2012 the Supreme Court upheld an EPA finding that greenhouse gases threaten public health and that the U.S. government is required to regulate them under the Clean Air Act. In that case the National Association of Manufacturers the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and 14 plaintiff states including Oklahoma led by Scott Pruitt sued the EPA and argued that the environmental impacts of greenhouse gases haven t been proven. EPA is not required to reprove the existence of the atom every time it approaches a scientific question the Supreme Court wrote in their ruling. 15 states also went to court to support the agency. Since then the agency has set standards for limiting carbon emissions from cars and new factories and in 2015 it announced the Clean Power Plan to work with states to reduce emissions from existing power plants. The Clean Power Plan aims reduce U.S. carbon emissions by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Then in 2016 the EPA passed a rule to reduce methane pollution which is hundreds of times more potent than carbon dioxide in terms of warming ability. Both rules have been challenged in the courts. The Clean Power Plan is currently on hold after electrical utilities 28 states including Oklahoma led by Scott Pruitt and others challenged it last year the D.C. Circuit appeals court will rule on it any day now and the case will likely be appealed to the Supreme Court regardless of the outcome. And more than a dozen states have sued the EPA over the methane rule too including you guessed it Oklahoma and Pruitt. Both of these rules are needed to uphold the U.S. s pledges to the international community to reduce carbon emissions as agreed to when the Paris Treaty was ratified in November. The EPA s progress on cleaning the country s air and waterways in the past 40 years has been remarkable. But carbon pollution is a different beast the impacts of climate change cannot be undone once they re set into motion. If we want to see similar progress with carbon pollution and avoid the worst impacts including forced migration habitat loss and rising seas we need to keep our focus on the longterm gains for everyone instead of shortterm profit for the few. And to do that we need a strong EPA.   Birds Tell Us to Act on Climate Pledge to stand with Audubon to call on elected officials to listen to science and work towards climate solutions.

https://www.apu.apus.edu/area-of-study/security-and-global-studies/resources/what-is-environmental-law/, What is environmental law and what does an environmental lawyer do? Environmental law is a collective term encompassing aspects of law that focus on protecting the natural environment human health and natural resources. It is a complex web of regulations policies and statutes designed to address issues such as air and water quality waste management and pollution control. The purpose of environmental law is to protect human health preserve the environment for present and future generations and ensure sustainable development. Environmental laws are implemented and enforced by various government agencies including the Environmental Protection Agency EPA in the United States. These agencies are tasked with monitoring and regulating activities that may have an impact on the environment including industrial operations environmental impact assessment and conservation. Environmental law focuses on a wide range of topics such as air quality laws water quality waste management chemical safety and the protection of endangered species. These laws are designed to minimize the environmental impact of human activities and prevent environmental contamination. At the international level environmental law encompasses worldwide environmental agreements that address global issues such as climate change ozone depletion and the protection of biodiversity. These agreements are often negotiated and implemented through cooperation between national governments and international organizations. Environmental law is constantly evolving in response to emerging environmental challenges advancements in environmental science and societal demands for greater environmental protection. As a result the field of both environmental science and law continues to grow in importance and complexity making it a crucial component of modern society. Protecting the environment is not only essential for preserving the natural world but also to protect human health. Environmental laws are designed to address various environmental concerns that can directly or indirectly impact human health such as air pollution water pollution and dangerous waste. Air pollution for instance has been linked to numerous health issues including respiratory diseases heart disease and even cancer. Environmental laws regulate emissions from various sources including vehicles factories and power plants to protect air quality and reduce the risks associated with poor air quality. Water quality is another critical area of focus in environmental law. Contaminated water can pose significant risks to human health leading to illnesses and even death. Environmental laws and regulations are in place to monitor and control water pollution ensuring that water sources are safe for consumption and other uses. Hazardous waste management is yet another aspect of environmental law that impacts human health. Improper disposal of hazardous substances can lead to environmental contamination and pose risks to human health. Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act CERCLA and other regulations help prevent waste from harming people and the environment. By addressing these and other environmental issues environmental laws play a vital role in protecting human health and ensuring a safe sustainable future for all. These regulations create a framework for industries governments and individuals to follow ensuring that our actions do not harm the environment or our health. Environmental law covers a broad range of issues with air quality water quality and waste management being some of its key areas of focus. These aspects of environmental law are critical for maintaining a healthy environment and ensuring we protect the environment and wellbeing of present and future generations. Regulations through such laws as the Clean Air Act aim to reduce air pollution by establishing standards for emissions from various sources including vehicles power plants and factories. These regulations help combat smog acid rain and other issues ultimately protecting health and the environment. Laws such as the Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act protect water sources from pollution ensuring that they are safe for consumption recreation and other uses. These laws regulate discharges of pollutants into waters and set standards for drinking water protecting aquatic ecosystems and health. Waste management is a crucial aspect of environmental law encompassing solid waste hazardous waste and nuclear waste. Regulations like the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act RCRA establish guidelines for waste generation transportation treatment storage and disposal ensuring that waste is managed responsibly and does not pose a threat to the environment or health. The Environmental Protection Agency is a critical player in the implementation and enforcement of environmental laws in the United States. Established in 1970 the EPA is responsible for developing and enforcing regulations that protect health and the environment. The EPAs primary functions include setting and enforcing environmental standards conducting research to support these standards and providing assistance to state and local governments for environmental management. The EPA also plays a vital role in ensuring compliance with environmental laws through inspections monitoring and enforcement actions. Some of the major laws overseen by the EPA include the Clean Air Act Clean Water Act Safe Drinking Water Act and the RCRA. The EPA works in collaboration with other federal state and local agencies to protect the environment and public health by regulating pollution promoting waste reduction and supporting sustainable development. The EPA is also actively involved in international environmental cooperation working with foreign governments international organizations and nongovernmental organizations to address global environmental issues such as transboundary pollution. By setting standards monitoring compliance and enforcing environmental laws the EPA plays a crucial role in safeguarding health and the environment ensuring a sustainable future for generations to come. Environmental law has a significant impact on businesses shaping the way they operate manufacture and manage waste. Companies must comply with environmental regulations which may include obtaining permits meeting emissions standards and following waste management guidelines. Compliance with environmental laws can lead to increased operational efficiency reduced waste and improved environmental performance. By adhering to these regulations businesses can protect themselves from legal liabilities avoid fines and penalties and enhance their reputation among customers investors and other stakeholders. Moreover many companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of sustainable business practices adopting voluntary measures such as green procurement renewable energy sourcing and corporate social responsibility initiatives. These efforts can help businesses stay competitive in a growing market for ecofriendly products and services while also contributing to environmental protection and conservation. Public participation is a fundamental aspect of environmental law ensuring that individuals and communities have a say in decisions that affect their health and the environment. This involvement can take many forms from attending public hearings and submitting comments on proposed federal regulations to participating in community cleanup events and advocating for stronger environmental protections. Laws such as the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA in the United States require federal agencies to engage the public in decisionmaking processes related to environmental impacts. This includes preparing environmental impact statements EIS and providing opportunities for public input on projects that could significantly affect the environment. Participation not only ensures that a wide range of perspectives are considered in environmental decisionmaking but also fosters greater awareness and understanding of environmental issues among the general population. By engaging citizens in the process environmental law can help empower individuals and communities to advocate for a cleaner healthier environment. Environmental justice is a critical component of environmental law addressing the disproportionate impact of environmental hazards on vulnerable communities. Often lowincome and minority populations are more likely to be exposed to pollution and other environmental risks due to factors such as housing location and lack of resources to mitigate these threats. Environmental justice seeks to ensure that all communities regardless of race ethnicity or socioeconomic status enjoy the same level of environmental protection and have equal access to decisionmaking processes related to their environment. This can involve addressing disparities in environmental enforcement promoting equitable distribution of environmental benefits and ensuring meaningful participation in environmental decisionmaking. Laws and regulations that incorporate environmental justice principles can help to reduce environmental disparities and promote social equity ensuring that all communities can enjoy a clean and healthy environment. International environmental law is a rapidly evolving field that addresses global environmental issues such as biodiversity loss and transboundary pollution. Through international agreements countries can cooperate and collaborate to tackle these complex challenges that require collective action. Key global environmental agreements include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC the Convention on Biological Diversity CBD and the Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and their Disposal. These agreements set standards and goals establish reporting and monitoring mechanisms and provide a platform for countries to work together on shared environmental concerns. However compliance with international environmental law can be challenging as enforcement mechanisms are often weaker than those found in domestic law. To promote compliance international agreements may include financial incentives capacitybuilding support and dispute resolution mechanisms. Overall international environmental law plays a crucial role in promoting global cooperation and coordination to address pressing environmental challenges and ensure a sustainable future for all. As the world continues to face new and complex environmental challenges environmental law must adapt and evolve to address these issues effectively. Environmental law will need to focus on both reducing greenhouse gas emissions and helping communities adapt to the impacts of a changing climate. This may involve developing new regulations and incentives for renewable energy promoting energy efficiency and ensuring that infrastructure is resilient to climaterelated risks. Biodiversity loss is another pressing concern with many species facing extinction due to habitat destruction and pollution. Environmental law can play a crucial role in preserving biodiversity by protecting critical habitats regulating the trade in endangered species and promoting sustainable land use practices. Singleuse plastics and plastic pollution pose a significant threat to the environment particularly marine ecosystems. Environmental law can address this issue by promoting the reduction reuse and recycling of plastics implementing bans or fees on singleuse items and encouraging the development of alternatives to plastic materials. The transition to a circular economy where resources are used efficiently and waste is minimized presents both challenges and opportunities for environmental law. New regulations and incentives may be needed to promote sustainable production and consumption practices encourage waste reduction and recycling and foster innovation in resourceefficient technologies. By addressing these emerging challenges environmental law can help pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future protecting the environment and the health and wellbeing of communities worldwide. Educating the public about environmental law and its importance is essential for ensuring widespread understanding and compliance. Awareness campaigns school curricula and public outreach initiatives can help to inform citizens about their rights and responsibilities under environmental law as well as the potential consequences of noncompliance. In addition educational programs can also promote a greater understanding of the link between environmental law and broader environmental issues such as biodiversity loss and pollution. By fostering a more environmentally literate population these initiatives can help to build public support for strong and effective environmental laws and regulations. Nongovernmental organizations NGOs and civil society play a crucial role in the development implementation and enforcement of environmental law. These groups can advocate for stronger environmental protections monitor compliance with existing laws and provide support to communities affected by environmental problems. NGOs such as Greenpeace the Natural Resources Defense Council NRDC and the Environmental Defense Fund EDF often engage in lobbying public awareness campaigns and legal action to advance their environmental goals. By working closely with governments businesses and local communities these organizations can help to ensure that environmental laws are effectively implemented and enforced. Environmental law and human rights are closely interconnected as a clean and healthy environment is essential for the enjoyment of many fundamental rights such as the rights to life health and an adequate standard of living. As a result environmental laws and regulations can play a critical role in protecting and promoting human rights particularly for vulnerable populations who may be disproportionately affected by environmental problems. Conversely human rights law can also provide a powerful framework for advancing environmental protection by recognizing the rights of individuals and communities to participate in decisionmaking processes related to the environment access information on environmental risks and seek remedies for environmental harms. Courts play a vital role in interpreting applying and enforcing environmental law. Through judicial review courts can assess the legality of government actions and decisions related to the environment ensuring that they comply with applicable laws and regulations. Courts can also resolve disputes between parties such as cases involving environmental harms or violations of environmental permits. Moreover courts can play a proactive role in shaping environmental law by interpreting legal provisions and principles establishing precedents and providing guidance for future cases. In some instances courts may recognize new rights or remedies related to environmental protection thereby expanding the scope of existing laws and regulations. Technology plays a significant role in environmental law both in terms of monitoring and enforcement and in providing innovative solutions to environmental challenges. Advanced technologies such as remote sensing satellite imagery and data analytics can enable more efficient monitoring of environmental compliance and help identify potential violations more quickly. In addition technological innovations can support the development and implementation of more effective environmental laws and regulations. For example cleaner production technologies renewable energy sources and waste reduction solutions can help businesses and individuals comply with environmental standards while also contributing to a more sustainable future for developing countries. Emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence AI and blockchain also hold promise for improving environmental law enforcement and compliance. AI can be used to analyze large datasets predict environmental impacts and identify patterns of noncompliance while blockchain can provide secure and transparent recordkeeping for environmental permits certifications and transactions. Environmental laws play a crucial role in addressing climate change by regulating greenhouse gas emissions and promoting sustainable practices. They help limit global warming by setting emissions standards encouraging the use of renewable resources and promoting energy efficiency. Environmental laws also support carbon trading schemes and other marketbased mechanisms that incentivize industries to reduce their carbon footprint. By holding corporations accountable for their impact on the environment these laws aim to protect present and future generations from dire consequences. Environmental law and natural resources are intrinsically linked as the former aims to conserve manage and sustainably use the latter. Environmental regulations govern land management water quality air quality conservation contaminant cleanup and protecting species deemed important to support species recovery all of which serves to prevent overexploitation and depletion. By protecting natural resources environmental laws support ecological balance biodiversity and the overall wellbeing of ecosystems. This in turn ensures resource sustainability and maintains a healthy environment. These treaties and conventions establish common goals set binding targets and provide frameworks for collaboration. Examples include the Paris Agreement and the Convention on Biological Diversity. By working together under international agreements countries can tackle environmental challenges more effectively and share resources technology and expertise to create a greener future. Environmental lawyers play a pivotal role in advocating for the environment by representing clients in legal disputes ensuring regulatory compliance and advising on environmental policies. They may work with government agencies corporations nonprofits and individuals to protect the environment and promote sustainable practices. Environmental lawyers could also help draft and enforce environmental regulations litigate contamination cases and negotiate agreements to mitigate environmental harm. Environmental laws function at multiple levels federal state and local to create a comprehensive regulatory framework. Federal laws such as the Clean Air Act and the Endangered Species Act provide overarching guidelines and minimum standards that state and local governments must follow. State and local laws may impose additional restrictions or requirements tailored to the specific needs and conditions of their jurisdictions. This multilayered approach allows for more efficient and targeted environmental regulation addressing the unique challenges faced by different regions. Environmental regulations aim to strike a balance between developmental needs and environmental protection by establishing guidelines for sustainable growth. They require industries to consider environmental impact assessments adopt pollution control measures and implement waste management practices to minimize negative environmental consequences elsewhere. These regulations promote sustainable development by integrating economic social and environmental considerations into decisionmaking processes ensuring that development projects do not compromise the wellbeing of ecosystems and future generations. Chemical safety and environmental pollution control are integral aspects of environmental law aiming to minimize the harmful effects of hazardous substances on human health and the environment. Laws such as CERCLA establish guidelines for the handling storage disposal and cleanup of hazardous waste. By regulating the use and release of toxic chemicals these laws protect ecosystems public health and natural resources from environmental contamination. Public participation in environmental decisionmaking is vital for creating effective and inclusive policies. By involving citizens in the regulatory process governments can better understand local concerns address potential conflicts and foster a sense of ownership among the public. Public input can take various forms such as community consultations public hearings and submission of comments on proposed regulations. This engagement enhances the quality of decisionmaking by incorporating diverse perspectives resulting in more equitable and sustainable outcomes. Additionally participation increases transparency and accountability fostering trust in the environmental regulatory process.

Even as large improvements in environmental quality occurred government and academia began to examine the potential consequences of regulation for economic growth and productivity. In general early studies found measurable but not severe effects on the overall national economy. While price increases due to regulatory requirements outweighed the stimulative effect of investments in pollution abatement they nearly offset one another. However these studies also highlighted potentially substantial effects on local labor markets due to the regional and industry concentration of plant closures.  More recently a substantial body of work examined industryspecific effects of environmental regulation on the productivity of pollutionintensive firms most likely to face pollution control costs as well as on plant location and employment decisions within firms. Most econometricbased studies found relatively small or no effect on sectorspecific productivity and employment though firms were less likely to open plants in locations subject to more stringent regulation compared to other U.S. locations. In contrast studies that used economywide models to explicitly account for sectoral linkages and intertemporal effects found substantial sectorspecific effects due to environmental regulation including in sectors that were not directly regulated. It is also possible to think about the overall impacts of environmental regulation on the economy through the lens of benefitcost analysis. While this type of approach does not speak to how the costs of regulation are distributed across sectors it has the advantage of explicitly weighing the benefits of environmental improvements against their costs. If benefits are greater than costs then overall social welfare is improved. When conducting such exercises it is important to anticipate the ways in which improvements in environmental quality may either directly improve the productivity of economic factors such as through the increased productivity of outdoor workers or change the composition of the economy as firms and households change their behavior. If individuals are healthier for example they may choose to reallocate their time between work and leisure. While introducing a role for pollution in production and household behavior can be challenging studies that have partially accounted for this interconnection have found substantial impacts of improvements in environmental quality on the overall economy. This paper is part of the Environmental Economics Working Paper Series.
https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/06/23/two-thirds-of-americans-think-government-should-do-more-on-climate/, Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. See here to read more about the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology. A majority of Americans continue to say they see the effects of climate change in their own communities and believe that the federal government falls short in its efforts to reduce the impacts of climate change. At a time when partisanship colors most views of policy broad majorities of the public including more than half of Republicans and overwhelming shares of Democrats say they would favor a range of initiatives to reduce the impacts of climate change including largescale tree planting efforts tax credits for businesses that capture carbon emissions and tougher fuel efficiency standards for vehicles according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Public concern over climate change has been growing in recent years particularly among Democrats and there are no signs that the COVID19 pandemic has dampened concern levels. A recent Center analysis finds 60 view climate change as a major threat to the wellbeing of the United States as high a share taking this view as in any Pew Research Center survey going back to 2009. The new national survey by Pew Research Center conducted April 29 to May 5 among 10957 U.S. adults using the Center s online American Trends Panel finds a majority of U.S. adults want the government to play a larger role in addressing climate change. About twothirds 65 of Americans say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change a view that s about as widely held today as it was last fall. And public dissatisfaction with government environmental action is not limited solely to climate Majorities also continue to say the government is doing too little in other areas such as protecting air and water quality and wildlife. Consistent with public concerns over climate and the environment 79 of Americans say the priority for the country s energy supply should be developing alternative sources of energy such as wind and solar far fewer 20 give priority to expanding the production of oil coal and natural gas. To shift consumption patterns toward renewables a majority of the public 58 says government regulations will be necessary to encourage businesses and individuals to rely more on renewable energy fewer 39 think the private marketplace will ensure this change in habits. Partisans remain far apart on several overarching questions about climate change. Much larger shares of Democrats and those who lean toward the Democratic Party than Republicans and Republican leaners say human activity is contributing a great deal to climate change 72 vs. 22 that it is impacting their own local community 83 to 37 and that the government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change 89 to 35. Despite these differences there is bipartisan support for several policy options to reduce the effects of climate change. This is especially true when it comes to proposals put forth earlier this year by Republican members of Congress such as large scale treeplantings to help absorb carbon emissions and offering tax credits to businesses that capture carbon emissions. In order to reduce the effects of global climate change 90 of Americans favor planting about a trillion trees around the world to absorb carbon emissions in the atmosphere including comparably large shares of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 92 and Republicans and Republicanleaning independents 88. President Donald Trump expressed support for tree planting efforts in February during his State of the Union address. Similarly 84 of U.S. adults support providing a business tax credit for carbon capture technology that can store carbon emissions before they enter the atmosphere. Large majorities of Democrats 90 and Republicans 78 back this proposal which House Republicans rolled out earlier this year. Most Americans also support tougher restrictions on power plant emissions 80 taxing corporations based on the amount of carbon emissions they produce 73 and tougher fuelefficiency standards for automobiles and trucks 71. Partisan divides are wider on these three policies with Democrats much more supportive than Republicans. Still about half or more of Republicans say they would favor each of these policies including 64 who back tougher emission standards for power plants. While partisanship remains the predominant dividing line in many views of climate and the environment there are meaningful differences within party coalitions. In particular Republicans and Republican leaners who describe their political views as moderate or liberal roughly a third of all Republicans and leaners are much more likely than conservative Republicans to see local impacts of climate change support policies to address it and say the federal government is doing too little in areas of environmental protection. Further younger generations and women in the GOP tend to be more critical of government action on the environment than their older and male counterparts. Republican women also are more supportive of polices aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change than GOP men. Differences among Democrats and Democratic leaners are more modest. Strong majorities of both moderate or conservative and liberal Democrats believe the federal government is doing too little to reduce climate change and support a range of policies to address its effects on the environment. There are not meaningful differences in these views among Democrats by either gender or generation. A majority of Americans 63 say that climate change is affecting their local community a great deal or some. Fewer 37 say climate change is impacting their own community not too much or not at all. The share who see at least some local impact from climate change is about the same as it was last fall 62. Views of the local impact of climate change are largely similar among Americans who live in different regions of the county. In fact an identical 64 of those who live in the Northeast South and West say climate change is affecting their community a great deal or some. Those who live in the Midwest are slightly less likely to say this 58. Partisanship is a far larger factor in views of the local impact of climate change. A large majority of Democrats 83 say climate change is affecting their local community a great deal or some. By contrast far fewer Republicans 37 believe climate change is affecting their local community at least some most Republicans 62 say climate change is impacting their local community not too much or at all. Among Republicans and Republican leaners moderates and liberals 55 are much more likely than conservatives 27 to say climate change is impacting their community a great deal or some. Among Democrats and Democratic leaners large shares of both liberals 86 and conservative and moderates 81 see local impacts from climate change. A more granular analysis of geography shows that Americans who live near a coastline are more likely than those who live further away to say climate change is affecting their local community. This pattern holds within both parties but is particularly evident among Republicans. Seveninten of those who live less than 25 miles from the coastline say climate change is affecting their local community a great deal or some. By comparison 57 of those who live 300 miles or more from the coastline say climate change is affecting their local community at least some. Overall 45 of Republicans who live less than 25 miles from the coastline say climate change is affecting their local community at least some compared with a significantly smaller share 31 of Republicans who live 300 or more miles from the coastline. Roughly eightinten Democrats no matter where they live say climate change is affecting their local community at least some. However Democrats who live close to the coastline are more likely than Democrats who live farthest away from the ocean to say climate change is affecting their local community a great deal 39 vs. 29. When those who see a local impact from climate change are asked about the nature of the impact those who live near a coastline are far more likely 73 than those who live farther away 45 to cite rising sea levels that erode beaches and shorelines as a major impact in their community. Majorities of U.S. adults favor each of the five proposals to reduce the effects of climate change included in the survey. The most popular favored by 90 of Americans is to plant about a trillion trees to absorb carbon emissions. President Trump announced in this year s State of the Union that the U.S. would join the World Economic Forum s One Trillion Trees Initiative. Widespread public support extends to proposals to provide a tax credit to businesses for development of carbon capture and storage capacity 84 and tougher restrictions on power plant carbon emissions 80. About seveninten also favor taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions 73 and adopting tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars and trucks 71. The Trump administration has taken steps over the past year to roll back regulations on carbon emissions in areas such as fuelefficiency standards for vehicles and power plants emissions. Support for these policies aligns with how effective the public thinks they would be. A 2018 survey found majorities of Americans believed restrictions on power plant emissions tax incentives to encourage businesses to reduce carbon emissions and tougher fuelefficiency standards for cars would all make a difference at reducing climate change. Democrats are particularly supportive of policy proposals to reduce the effects of global climate change. Roughly 90 of Democrats favor each of these five policy proposals and differences among Democrats by ideology tend to be modest. For example 93 of Democrats including 96 of liberals and 91 of moderates and conservatives say they support tougher restrictions on power plant carbon emissions. Differences among Democrats across demographic characteristics such as age and gender also are small. Among Republicans there are large gaps in support for some of these policies by ideology as well as differences in views between GOP men and women. Moderate and liberal Republicans are broadly supportive of these proposals aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Twothirds or more favor each of the five proposals including 80 who say they support tougher power plant carbon emissions standards. Among conservative Republicans 87 support planting more trees to reduce the effects of climate change and 75 favor a tax credit for businesses to develop carbon capture and storage technology. However their support is significantly lower for other polices 55 back tougher restrictions on power plant emissions while fewer than half favor taxing corporations based on their carbon emissions 46 or tougher fuel efficiency standards for cars 44. Most Republican men and women support treeplanting efforts and offering a tax credit to businesses for carbon capture technology. But GOP women are significantly more likely than men to favor tougher emissions restrictions on power plants taxing corporations based on their emissions and tougher fuelefficiency standards for cars. Most U.S. adults think human activity such as the burning of fossil fuels contributes a great deal 49 or some 32 to climate change. About twointen 19 say human activity contributes not too much or not at all to climate change. Views on this question are about the same as they were last fall. Americans continue to be deeply politically divided over how much human activity contributes to climate change. About seveninten Democrats 72 say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change compared with roughly twointen Republicans 22 a difference of 50 percentage points. The difference is even wider among those at the ends of the ideological spectrum. A large majority of liberal Democrats 85 say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change. Only 14 of conservative Republicans say the same 45 of this group says human activity contributes not too much or not at all to climate change. Views about the role of human activity in climate change also vary by education among Democrats but not among Republicans. Democrats who have graduated from college are more likely to say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change than Democrats without a college degree. For example 86 of Democrats with a postgraduate degree say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change compared with a smaller majority 58 of Democrats with no college experience. Among Republicans comparably small shares across level of education see human activity as contributing a great deal to climate change. Previous Pew Research Center analyses have found a similar dynamic in views of climate change by level of science knowledge based on an 11item index. Among Democrats those with higher levels of science knowledge are more likely to say human activity influences climate change a great deal than those with lower levels of science knowledge. By contrast there is no such relationship among Republicans. There also are significant differences in these views among Democrats by race and ethnicity. Overall 80 of white Democrats and 70 of Hispanic Democrats say human activity contributes a great deal to climate change. By contrast black Democrats are much less likely to take this view 49 believe human activity contributes a great deal to climate change. Reducing reliance on carbonbased fuels is viewed by climate advocates as a critical step to preventing the worst impacts of climate change. The survey finds a broad majority of Americans 79 say the more important priority for the country is to develop alternative sources such as wind and solar far fewer 20 say the more important energy priority is to expand the production of oil coal and natural gas. Views on this question are about the same as they were in October 2019 the first time the measure was asked on Pew Research Center s online American Trends Panel. An overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 91 say that developing alternative sources should be the nation s energy priority. A smaller majority of Republicans and Republican leaners 65 also takes this view. Among moderate and liberal Republicans a large share 81 say developing alternative sources should be the nation s energy priority. The views of moderate and liberal Republicans are relatively close to those of Democrats 88 of moderate and conservative Democrats and a nearunanimous 97 of liberal Democrats say the more important energy priority is developing alternative sources. By contrast conservative Republicans are much more divided in their views A narrow majority 54 gives greater priority to developing alternative energy sources while 45 say the priority should be expanding the production of oil coal and natural gas. On balance a majority of U.S. adults see a role for government in shifting usage patterns toward renewables. About sixinten Americans 58 say that government regulations are necessary to encourage businesses and consumers to rely more on renewable energy sources. Fewer 39 think the private marketplace will encourage the use of renewable energy without the need for government intervention. Partisans hold opposing views on this question 77 of Democrats including those who lean to the Democratic Party believe that government regulations are necessary to shift the country toward reliance on renewable energy while 61 of Republicans and Republican leaners say the private marketplace will be enough. Views on this question and opinion dynamics among partisans are comparable to what they were when the question was last asked in 2018. Americans overall preference to prioritize alternative energy is reflected in views of specific energy source development. Large shares say they would favor developing more solar panel farms 90 and more wind turbine farms 83. There is far less support for expanding fossil fuel energy sources. Majorities oppose expanding coal mining 65 hydraulic fracturing 60 and offshore oil and gas drilling 58. A narrow majority of the public 55 opposes more nuclear power plants in the country while 43 are in favor. Larger shares of women than men oppose expanding nuclear power a pattern that s seen among both Republicans and Democrats and is consistent with views about nuclear power in past Center surveys. Public views on which energy sources the country should expand have been stable in recent years and opinions are very similar to those measured in 2018 and 2019 surveys. There is bipartisan support for expanding solar and wind power though somewhat smaller majorities of conservative Republicans back these two policies. By contrast Republicans especially conservative Republicans are more supportive than Democrats of expanding fossil fuel energy sources and nuclear power. Majorities of conservative Republicans favor expanding offshore drilling 72 hydraulic fracturing 65 and coal mining 63. By contrast about half or fewer of moderate and liberal Republicans favor expanding these forms of energy development. Democrats broadly oppose these methods and opposition is particularly widespread among liberal Democrats. Differences in views of energy development by partisanship are about the same as they have been in recent years. See Appendix for details. Consistent with past Pew Research Center surveys younger Republicans give more priority to alternative energy development and are less supportive of expanding fossil fuel sources than older Republicans. Overall 79 of Millennial and Gen Z Republicans prioritize the development of alternative energy sources compared with 66 of Gen X Republicans and 55 of Republicans who are Baby Boomers or older. While Republicans generally are skeptical about the need for government to encourage public reliance on renewable sources about half 0f Millennial and Gen Z Republicans 48 think government regulations are necessary smaller shares of older Republicans say this. Millennial and younger Republicans are less supportive of expanding the use of offshore oil and gas drilling coal mining or hydraulic fracturing than Baby Boomer and older Republicans. There s a similar but smaller generational dynamic among Republicans in views of expanding nuclear power. Among Republicans there is broad support across generations for expanding solar and wind farms though support is somewhat higher among Millennial and Gen Z than older Republicans. At this point Gen Z adults hold views on a range of issues including the role of government diversity and climate and energy that are similar to those of Millennials. Majorities of Americans continue to say the federal government is doing too little to protect key aspects of the environment. About twothirds of Americans say the federal government is doing too little to protect water quality of rivers lakes and streams 67 protect air quality 65 and reduce the effects of climate change 65. About sixinten think the federal government is doing too little to protect animals and their habitats 62 and a slightly smaller majority say the federal government is doing too little to protect open lands in national parks 54. These findings come amid a changing federal regulatory landscape. The Trump administration is reversing or seeking to change more than 100 rules and regulations related to carbon dioxide emissions clean air water or toxic chemicals. Public views on how much the federal government is doing to protect key aspects of the environment are virtually unchanged in the last two years. In Pew Research Center surveys in both 2018 and 2019 about twothirds of Americans said the federal government was doing too little to protect air or water quality or reduce the effects of climate change. Over the past several years Americans have become significantly more likely to say protecting the environment and addressing climate change should be top priorities for the president and Congress according to a 2020 Pew Research Center survey. Democrats remain far more likely than Republicans to say the government is doing too little to address aspects of the environment. For instance about nineinten liberal Democrats say the federal government is doing too little to protect air quality 93 or water quality 91. By comparison among conservative Republicans just 36 say the federal government is doing too little to protect water quality and only 28 say this about air quality. Majorities of conservative Republicans say the federal government is doing the right amount in these areas. Moderate and liberal Republicans are more critical of government action on the environment than conservative Republicans. Narrow majorities say the government is doing too little to protect water and air quality wildlife and their habit and to reduce the effects of climate change. Ideological gaps among Democrats are more modest than among Republicans. See Appendix for details. Among Republicans women and younger adults are more likely to say the government is doing too little to address aspects of the environment than men and older adults in the GOP. About half of Republican women 51 say the government is doing too little to protect water quality compared with 39 of Republican men. There s a similar gap in views that government is doing too little to protect air quality 47 to 32 and Republican women also are significantly more likely than men to say the government is doing too little in the three other environmental areas included in the survey. Millennial and younger Republicans are at least 10 points more likely than Baby Boomer and older Republicans to say the federal government is doing too little in each of the five areas measured in the survey. For example 53 of Millennial and younger Republicans say the federal government is doing too little to protect air quality compared with just 30 of Baby Boomer and older Republicans. Among Democrats there are hardly any gaps in views on these questions by generation or gender. See appendix for more details. CORRECTION June 25 2020 Due to a rounding error a previous version of the chart Those living near the coast are most likely to say climate change is affecting their local community misstated the combined total for views among Democrats and Democratic leaners living at least 300 miles from the coast. It should be 83. The change does not materially affect findings in this report. Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers

Sections Sections Share Share Search Sections Sections Share Share Subscribe to Governance WeeklySign Up Commentary When Congress laid the foundation for today s environmental regulation in the early 1970s the idea that states inevitably cut corners in pollution control and conservation to attract business was a powerful argument for national action. When industrial debris in Cleveland s Cuyahoga River caught fire and oil from an offshore blowout blighted Santa Barbara s beaches in 1969 the incidents became national symbols of a race to the bottom in state and local politics. Recently this view has gained new support. Not long ago the press carried graphic accounts of hog wastes washing down Virginia s Pagan River toward the Chesapeake Bay from a plant owned by Smithfield Foods Inc. the East Coast s largest producer of pork products. Lax state enforcement of national water pollution laws could create pollution havens and lead to a shift of manufacturing and jobs that would penalize the conscientious states the New York Times editorialized. But the race to the bottom idea is too simplistic to describe the forces that shape state environmental policies in the 1990s. The idea is outdated for three reasons. First evidence is by now overwhelming that businesses rarely decide where to locate or expand based on the strength or weakness of state environmental programs. Second state politics have been transformed in ways that make it more likely that pollution and conservation issues will get a fair hearing independent of federal action. Finally and most important public attitudes have changed. Today states compete to gain prosperity in a fastchanging economy. After nearly 30 years of government action and scientific progress government officials business executives and voters find that some environmental measures aid in that contest. There is growing evidence that some states lead in economic growth and environmental protection while other states lag behind in both. To call attention to these changes is not to deny that state and local governments face tough tradeoffs that businesses often lobby to weaken environmental rules or that some polluters still try to beat the system. Hiring inspectors to enforce the law or buying land to protect a watershed is expensive and must vie for limited state funds with improving schools building roads and paying for Medicaid and welfare. Environmental issues continue to be contentious because they often do pit jobs against cleaner air or more conservation and sometimes both choices offer economic benefits. When stakes are high business labor homeowners and other groups will fight for their interests. And of course there will always be cheaters. Thirty years ago the assumption that there was a race to the bottom among the states was important because Congress was debating the need for a national framework of environmental protection. That question is now settled. Mainstream Democrats and Republicans agree that air pollution water pollution and other environmental problems that cross state lines should continue to be controlled by federal rules. Because most of our daily attention is drawn to hardfought battles at the perimeter of government authority it is easy to forget that we have witnessed an exceptional event in the past three decades the successful introduction of a new theme in national policy. Today the question of whether states shortchange environmental protection to attract business is important for different reasons. First we have reached a turning point in national environmental policy in which some readjustment of federal and state roles is inevitable. Thanks in part to the considerable success of national laws aimed at controlling major sources of pollution and encouraging conservation on large tracts of federal land public attention is now turning to problems that are harder to solve from Washington. The next generation of environmental policies will tackle widely scattered sources of pollution and conservation opportunities that affect farms and housing developments as well as forests and meadows. Second both Democrats and Republicans are calling for new approaches to the first generation of environmental problems in order to give more flexibility to states. Frustration with the high costs and rigidity of command and control regulations has prompted moves to supplement those rules with market incentives negotiated agreements industry standards and other techniques that decentralize decisions. Third the reach of federal regulation may be overly broad. The National Academy of Public Administration has suggested for example that controlling chemical contaminants in drinking water and deciding when where and how to clean up hazardous waste might better be done by state and local governments. Continuing confusion about the capabilities of state governments is costly. Muchneeded revisions of three of the legal cornerstones of national environmental policy the Superfund Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts are stalled in Congress in part because of troublesome questions about how federal and state governments should share authority. In the 1970s sudden new pollution control requirements with short deadlines called for large unplanned investments that were extremely costly to some industries. Today environmental costs rarely determine business location because they have become a relatively small and usually predictable element of corporate expenses. Even for chemical and petroleum industries annual pollution abatement expenses run less than 2 percent of sales. Capital costs for pollution control vary widely from one industry to another ranging from 2 percent of total capital costs for machinery and 3 percent for electronics to 13 percent for chemical industries and 25 percent for petroleum and coal. Even when substantial though those costs are usually dwarfed by labor real estate transportation energy and tax considerations in relocation decisions according to surveys of corporate executives. One caveat though. Sudden changes in pollution rules can sometimes close down individual factories and destroy jobs. Retrofitting old factories can be extremely expensive and small or marginal businesses cannot always survive government demands to make changes. Empirical evidence confirms that the rigor of state environmental policies generally has little influence on business location. Economists who have found the issue hard to analyze because of the paucity of information about business relocation and the complexity of environmental policy have generally found no strong association between environmental compliance costs and business location. Studies during the Reagan administration when national oversight lessened found no evidence of businesses moving in search of pollution havens. Likewise there is little evidence that international businesses seek pollution havens according to a recent report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. At times businesses may choose a high standard of environmental protection for reasons having nothing to do with state law. Investors stung by plummeting Rust Belt stock prices in the 1970s when companies predicted devastating costs to comply with the first wave of environmental laws now want to know that firms have planned for new requirements. And firms with plants in many locations may find it economical to adhere to a single set of environmental standards. States in the 1990s bear little resemblance to states in the 1960s and their role in environmental protection has fundamentally changed. As political entities they have been transformed by growth of professional staffs vigorous twoparty systems use of referenda and initiatives to make policy and procedural requirements that assure greater public participation in regulatory decisions. Many aspects of environmental protection have been assimilated into state and local politics as they have been into national politics. Political scientist Barry Rabe notes in Environmental Protection in the 1990s that about 70 percent of important environmental legislation enacted by the states now has little or nothing to do with national policy and only about 20 percent of the 10 billion that states now spend annually on environment and natural resources comes from Washington. State and local governments are responsible for nearly all the enforcement of national environmental laws and continue to dominate decisions in areas like land use and waste disposal. Occasionally states have cooperated to spread the costs of addressing a complex problem or to concentrate pressures for action among affected states. Lax enforcement still occurs of course but it is more likely to be checked by political interests within the state. Finally the idea that states routinely minimize environmental protection to attract business is outdated because we have learned a few things in the past 25 years about the benefits and costs of environmental protection. Even without a federal prod voters have shown that they are sometimes willing to pay for state or local cleanup or conservation if they can reap the rewards. Environmental measures that contribute to critical infrastructure attract skilled workers or satisfy the needs of particular businesses are rightly seen as having economic value. Governors and legislators support environmental proposals that promote safe drinking water or provide adequate sanitation not because Washington requires it but because public health is a precondition to prosperity. Voters approve measures that improve an area s appeal as a place to live and work in part because catering to the preferences of skilled workers can enhance economic growth. And tourism accounting for nearly 10 percent of U.S. jobs in 1995 is not the only business with a direct interest in pollution control or conservation. Firms that require large amounts of pure water for example computerchip manufacturers foodprocessing companies and breweries to name a few have economic incentives to keep streams rivers and groundwater uncontaminated. At the other extreme spending money to clean up pollution that drifts flows seeps or can be transported into other states is likely to be viewed as a poor prospect by state politicians. And giving up prime development land to protect endangered species is usually seen as offering scant economic or political benefits. Environmental scientists must consider effects of development on future generations. State politicians usually can t. When poor investments for states are priorities for the nation rigorous federal oversight is needed. In general though support for environmental protection is a result not a cause of prosperity. At least at the extremes states with strong economies tend to support relatively strong environmental protection programs while those with weak economies often support weaker programs. In the 1990s the real competition among states is not a race to the bottom to minimize environmental protection but a race to the bottom line to improve property values and increase tax revenues. States compete to gain prosperity in an economy where firms are consolidating capital is increasingly mobile and skilled workers are sometimes in short supply. Because experience has shown that wealthy economies devote more resources to environmental protection than do struggling ones we should be concerned about the future of pollution control and conservation in relatively poor states. Some research has suggested direct links between prosperity and environmental protection. An analysis by the Institute for Southern Studies in 1994 found that 9 of the 12 states that were strongest in environmental protection also were strongest in economic growth while 12 of the 14 states that were weakest in environmental protection also ranked among the lowest in economic growth. States that have been dependent on oil timber mining or other natural resource industries may face special problems with improving environmental protection and with assembling the ingredients of lasting growth. Such differences among states are not surprising. State boundaries were drawn by accidents of settlement and political compromise not by a desire for equity. Those chance divisions have produced variations in political culture and history that in general we celebrate. They have also produced variations in natural resources and taxable assets. State environmental protection which lies at a junction of economic forces political will and historical tradition naturally reflects such enduring differences. One danger though is that states that are weak in both economic growth and environmental protection are particularly vulnerable to a funding squeeze that may turn out to be an important political dynamic during the next 10 years the prospect of increasing demands for environmental protection that no one is willing or able to pay for. Many of the least prosperous states depend most heavily on federal funds to finance environmental protection at a time when such funds are increasingly scarce. And their budgets are likely to be more heavily burdened by demands like welfare and Medicaid and less easily expandable by tax increases or borrowing. None of this is an argument for economic determinism however. State economies are constantly changing as markets change and experience has shown that political will and fortuitous circumstances can overcome obstacles to growth. Booming hightech industries and tourism made the Rocky Mountain states traditionally dependent on mining timber and agriculture the fastestgrowing region of the country in the early 1990s. And the recent opening of the 11 million Jack Nicklausdesigned Old Works Golf Course in Anaconda Montana built atop a Superfund site is not an isolated event. Giving up on the simplistic theme of a race to the bottom among states to minimize environmental protection opens the way for considering harder questions. How much flexibility should states have to make choices about environmental measures? How can national priorities not in the interest of any one state best be advanced? How should chronic inequities among states be dealt with? A number of initiatives already under way suggest partial answers. Variations on national themes. Setting clear national goals and giving states as much flexibility as possible in how to carry them out is the best way to mediate between national priorities and state differences. Supplementing standards with wider use of market incentives negotiated solutions and business selfmonitoring can broaden local choices while respecting national priorities. The federal government should concentrate oversight wherever states are weakest as the National Academy of Public Administration has suggested. And as information improves state progress should be judged by environmental conditions not by numbers of inspections and permits. All this is of course much easier said than done. After 30 years of efforts and billions of dollars spent the United States does not yet have a reliable system of measuring trends in environmental conditions that could be a basis for setting national goals and marking progress toward them. Information as regulation. Requiring that the public receive detailed information about environmental consequences can create incentives for business and governments to limit pollution particularly if the consequences directly affect those receiving the information and if facts are accompanied by objective interpretation. Using Surf Your Watershed the newest EPA Internet site for example anyone who enters a zip code can now learn about pollution sources water quality and drinking water sources. And the 1996 Amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act passed by the 104th Congress after two years of acrimony require local water systems to notify customers once a year about bacteria and chemicals in tap water as one way of encouraging careful monitoring. These information requirements follow the example of the Toxic Release Inventory a provision added to federal law in 1986 and recently expanded which requires companies to report on their discharges of toxic substances. Regional cooperation. The possible benefits of regional cooperation have received too little attention in a political system that emphasizes national and state authority. Many environmental problems are inherently regional in scope rather than national or local. We need to understand better why some attempts at regional cooperation succeed and others fail. Creative financing. Voters who have effectively capped state revenues by resisting tax increases remain willing to pay special fees for environmental services or projects that are viewed as needed investments helping to alleviate the funding squeeze especially for the least prosperous states. Threequarters of state and local waste disposal programs are financed by special fees a proportion that has increased rapidly in the 1990s according to a 1995 General Accounting Office report. Special fees also have disadvantages of course. Linking revenueraising to spending on particular activities can interfere with the agility of the political system in responding to changing public needs. It would be a mistake to let the fears of the 1970s dominate action in the 2000s. The race to the bottom is a powerful idea that resonated with sudden changes in environmental requirements during the 1970s. It has little bearing on the challenges of the 1990s when environmental costs are a relatively small portion of business expenses state governments are more open to include environmental interests and public understanding has improved. After nearly 30 years environmental protection has been assimilated into the political system where it will continue to evolve in thousands of separate national state local and private actions. The success of those actions depends in part on our ability to adapt our ideas about how governments and businesses work to changing circumstances. In a time of scarce national resources and continuing disparities among states that are successful in economic growth and environmental protection and those that are less successful at both our attention should now turn from the race to the bottom to the race to the bottom line.

When doing business in the United States companies have to pay attention to not one but two sets of environmental regulatory bodies. There is the overriding Federal Environmental Protection Agency EPA then there are the individual state agencies. The EPA sets the national standards for environmental protection. Because every state has a different set of natural and economic parameters states typically adopt a law at least as stringent as the federal one. That is as long as the state can assume primary responsibility for implementing and enforcing the law. The federal government however continues to have ultimate enforcement authority in all cases. The Agency has oversight responsibility over the states activities and monitors state and tribal implementation of EPA approved programs. While this sounds pretty straightforward it can be confusing in practice. Particularly regarding inspection and implementationenforcement issues. In a recent document EPA s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance OECA finalized a policy to help clarify the process so that neither party s actions subvert contradict or unnecessarily duplicate the actions of the other party.  When dealing with facility inspections the July 11 2019 memorandum Enhancing Effective Partnerships Between the EPA and the States in Civil Enforcement and Compliance Assurance Work mandates that EPA regions and states communicate as they develop their separate inspection priorities in order to avoid duplicate or overlapping inspections that would lead them to inspect the same facility for the same regulatory requirements within the same twelvemonth period.  Multiple inspections by the EPA and the states may however be appropriate for complex sites where the inspections focus on different regulatory requirements or where the EPA and a state agree that multiple inspections serve a valuable purpose. The EPA supports a no surprises principle. In any investigation where the EPA has the lead EPA regions should share information requests and inspection reports for authorized programs with the state con currently with sending them to the recipient.  In terms of implementation and enforcement the EPA generally will defer to a state. But because the EPA retains concurrent enforcement authority there are specific situations where the EPA may choose to act. The following are examples taken directly from the EPA policy What does this mean for your business? At a minimum a company must be aware of and ensure that it is complying with its state environmental parameters. While that is the best place to start one should also be aware of and in compliance with the Federal laws as the EPA has ultimate jurisdiction.
