Scores of activists including human rights defenders members of ethnic and religious minorities and dissidents remain in prison on vague national security charges or are serving sentences after grossly unfair trials. Security forces impunity is rampant with no government investigations into their use of excessive and lethal force torture sexual assault and other serious abuses. Authorities have expanded their efforts in enforcing abusive compulsory hijab laws. Security agencies have also targeted family members of those killed during the protests. President Ebrahim Raeesi is accused of overseeing the mass extrajudicial executions of political prisoners in 1988. Security forces repressed widespread protests that erupted across the country in September 2022 with unlawful killing torture sexually assault and enforced disappearances of protestors including women and children as part of a pattern of serious violations. Human rights groups are investigating the reported deaths of approximately 500 protestors including at least 68 children. In the majority of cases security forces reportedly shot the victims using various types of bullets. Cases Human Rights Watch documented included security forces sexually assaulting a 17yearold boy security forces pushing a high school student onto a lit gas range during the arrest and beating and whipping her during interrogation and interrogators torturing a boy by shoving needles under his nails. Iran remains one of the world s top practitioners of the death penalty applying it to individuals convicted of crimes committed as children and under vague national security charges occasionally it is also used for nonviolent offenses. Iranian law deems actions like insulting the prophet apostasy samesex relations adultery alcohol consumption and certain nonviolent drugrelated offenses to be punishable by death. Based on a report from the Iran Human Rights Organization more than 700 executions took place in Iran during the period between January and November 2023. This marks a substantial increase compared to the same period in 2022. Among those executed 238 were charged with intentional murder and 390 with drugrelated offenses. Furthermore 10 individuals received death sentences for political or securityrelated charges or blasphemy and 1 person was sentenced to death on espionage charges. Judicial authorities drastically increased the use of vaguely defined national security charges that could carry the death penalty against protestors including for allegedly injuring others and destroying public property. Following grossly unfair trials where many of defendants did not have access to the lawyer of their choice authorities issued 25 death sentences in connection to the protests. As of September 20 authorities executed 7 people and 11 cases were overturned by the supreme court. On February 21 Branch 15 of Tehran s Revolutionary Court sentenced Jamshid Sharmahd 67 a GermanIranian citizen with United States residency to death on the charge of corruption on earth according to Mizan news agency. The Iranian authorities allege that he was a leader of an opposition group the Kingdom Assembly of Iran which was connected to multiple terror attacks including the 2008 bombing of a mosque in Shiraz a claim that Sharmahd denies. On May 6 authorities executed SwedishIranian national Habibollah Asivad Chaab on alleged terrorism charges after abducting him in Turkey. Iranian authorities severely restricted the freedoms of assembly and expression arresting hundreds of activists lawyers journalists students and artists. The authorities also targeted outspoken family members of those killed or families of protesters executed after unfair trials pressuring them to avoid holding memorial services around the anniversaries of their deaths. The crackdown extended to universities. Since late July at least 29 university instructors critical of government policies were dismissed suspended or forced to retire or their contracts were not renewed. The actual number is most likely higher. According to the Volunteer Committee tracking detainees since September at least 161 students faced disciplinary actions due to protestrelated activities. The number of those who were summoned by disciplinary committees was much higher. On August 8 Branch 26 of Tehran s Revolutionary Court sentenced Allameh University student activists Zia Nabavi and Hasti Amiri to one year in prison on the charge of propaganda against the state which stemmed from their participation in the protests against the alleged poisoning of schoolgirls in the country. Artists who vocally supported the protest movement faced reprisals arrests and prosecution. Authorities have targeted dozens of highprofile actors supportive of the protests including Taraneh Alidoosti who was released from prison on January 4. On July 12 Isfahan s judiciary chief Assadolah Jafari announced that rapper Toumaj Salehi detained during the protests received a sixyearandthreemonth prison sentence for corruption on earth. On August 28 authorities arrested a singer and composer Mehdi Yarahi after he released a song in support of the protest movement. Mizan News the judiciary s news outlet reported that Yarahi was charged with releasing an illegal song. KurdishIranian rapper Saman Seyedi known as Yasin arrested during the protests faced enmity against the state charges including weapon possession and conspiracy to threaten national security. He remained imprisoned and reportedly suffered physical and psychological torture including solitary confinement and severe beatings. Over the past year people with disabilities staged several protests over inadequate pension and poor living conditions. On several occasions security forces attempted to break up their protests including with tear gas.Authorities imposed several localized internet shutdowns during protests particularly in Sistan and Baluchistan province. Scores of human rights defenders labor rights activists and other civil society activists including Narges Mohammadi Bahareh Hedayat Niloufar Bayani Sepideh Kashani Houman Jokar Taher Ghadirian Keyvan Samimi Reza Shahabi Anisha Assadolahi Mehdi Mahmoudian and Sepideh Gholian remain behind bars while authorities continued to harass arrest and prosecute those seeking accountability and justice. In February Iranian authorities announced a broad amnesty purportedly covering those arrested charged or detained during widespread protests. On March 13 Hojatollah Eslam Ejeyi the head of Iran s judiciary stated that 22000 people were included in the amnesty orders related to the protests. However the amnesty excluded many human rights defenders with lengthy sentences and protesters facing capital charges. Since April the authorities arrested sentenced or summoned dozens of activists some of whom had been recently released and granted amnesty. On April 28 Iran s security forces raided the house of Mohammad Habibi the imprisoned spokesman of the Tehran Teachers Union and arrested nine activists visiting his family. Most of these activists had previously been wrongfully imprisoned. In July the Kurdistan Human Rights Network reported that 55 lawyers were summoned to the Prosecutor s Office in Bukan Kurdistan province. They were accused of supporting Mahsa Jina Amini s family by signing a statement offering legal assistance. On August 30 Saleh Nikbakht the lawyer who represents Amini s family appeared before Branch 28 of Tehran s Revolutionary Court on charges of propaganda against the state which stemmed from his media interviews about Amini s case. On August 16 authorities in Gilan province raided homes and detained 12 individuals including 11 women s rights defenders and a political activist. Niloofar Hamedi and Elaheh Mohammadi two journalists from the Shargh and HamMihan Iranian newspapers who were among the first journalists who reported on Amini s death were arrested in September 2022. On October 22 branch 15 of Tehrans revolutionary court convicted them on charges of collaborating with the hostile American government colluding against national security and engaging in propaganda activity against the regime sentencing them to seven and six years in prison respectively.  Iranian courts particularly revolutionary courts regularly fall far short of providing fair trials and use confessions likely obtained under torture as evidence in court. Authorities have failed to meaningfully investigate numerous allegations of torture against detainees and routinely restrict detainees access to legal counsel particularly during the initial investigation period. Iranian authorities violations of due process rights and fair trial standards as well as torture and illtreatment of detainees have been systemic features of the government s crackdown on antigovernment protests. Revolutionary court judges have persistently failed to consider allegations of torture and illtreatment including in trials where defendants were sentenced to the death penalty. On August 31 Javad Rouhi a 31yearold imprisoned Iranian protester died under suspicious circumstances in northern Iran sparking concerns about his treatment. Rouhi had endured severe torture after his arrest during the September 2022 protests and was subsequently convicted after an unfair trial. Nowshahr prison in Mazandaran province announced that he had been transferred to a hospital due to a concussion and died there despite medical assistance. His death is under investigation by the Prosecutor s Office as confirmed by his lawyer. In recent years Iran s security apparatus has escalated its targeting of dual citizens and foreign nationals whom they perceive have links to Western academic economic and cultural institutions using them as bargaining chips in disputes with western states. Women face discrimination in personal status matters related to marriage divorce inheritance and decisions relating to children. Under the civil code a husband has the right to choose the place of living and can prevent his wife from having certain occupations if he deems them against family values. Under the Passports Law a married woman may not obtain a passport or travel outside the country without the written permission of her husband who can revoke such permission at any time. The civil code allows girls to marry at age 13 and boys at age 15 and at younger ages if authorized by a judge. Cases of femicide are increasingly reported in media and social media but Iran has no law on domestic violence to prevent abuse and protect survivors. As reported by Shargh newspaper based on official statistics at least 165 women in Iran were killed by male family members between March 2021 and the end of June 2023 an average of 1 such killing every 4 days. From midMarch to midMay 2023 alone 27 women were reported murdered in socalled honor killings which are killings of women and girls perpetrated by family members. In March Iranian media outlets reported on the apparently deliberate poisoning of girls at least 58 schools in 10 provinces across the country since January 2023. Authorities promised to investigate but have yet to provide any concrete explanation for the incidents. Since August the authorities have allowed a limited number of tickets to be sold to women and girls to attend the national football league s games in some cities including Tehran and Isfahan. On October 28 Armita Garavand a 17yearold student died after 28 days in a coma. Media reports indicated that she fell unconscious after she was assaulted by an enforcer of compulsory hijab law at the metro station. Authorities said she fell due to a sudden drop in blood pressure and have severely restricted the independent media s access to her family and friends. Iranian authorities have intensified efforts to enforce compulsory hijab laws. They prosecute women and girls including celebrities for not wearing the hijab in public issue traffic citations to passengers without the hijab and close businesses that do not comply with hijab laws. In recent cases the judiciary has mandated psychological treatment for at least two actresses convicted of hijab noncompliance a move protested by Iranian mental health associations. On September 21 the Iranian parliament approved a draft Hijab and Chastity Bill with 70 articles proposing additional penalties such as fines increased prison terms up to 10 years for expressing opposition to hijab regulations and restrictions on job and educational opportunities for hijab violations. The law also expands the authority of intelligence and law enforcement agencies in enforcing compulsory hijab. On December 13 the Expediency Council upheld the draft bill.  Iran s strict antiabortion laws have introduced additional measures to limit women s access to abortion. The Ministry of Health has halted the issuance of licenses for the production and import of firsttrimester prenatal screening kits. Pregnant people who choose to undergo prenatal genetic screening tests must cover the associated costs themselves. Under Iranian law samesex conduct is punishable by flogging and for men the death penalty. Although Iran permits and subsidizes sex reassignment surgery for transgender people no law prohibits discrimination against them. Iranian law denies freedom of religion to Baha is and discriminates against them. Authorities continue to arrest and prosecute members of the Baha i faith on vague national security charges and to close businesses owned by them. Iranian authorities also systematically refuse to allow Baha is to register at public universities because of their faith. The government also discriminates against other religious minorities including Sunni Muslims and restricts cultural and political activities among the country s Azeri Kurdish Arab and Baluch ethnic minorities. Minority activists are regularly arrested and prosecuted on vaguely defined national security charges in trials that fall grossly short of international standards. On August 28 the Kurdistan Human Rights Network reported that in July alone at least 100 individuals had been apprehended for political reasons by security forces in Kurdish areas. A larger number of citizens have been summoned to security and judicial authorities in various cities including West Azerbaijan Kurdistan Kermanshah Ilam and Tehran.  On the anniversary of the death in custody of Mahsa Jina Amini Iran s authorities dispatched thousands of its militarysecurity personnel along with vehicles and equipment to Kurdishmajority areas in the western provinces where protests had been widespread over the past year. As one of the world s top 10 greenhouse gas emitters Iran s significant contribution to the climate crisis has global human rights implications. The majority of its emissions originate from the energy sector with 94 percent of electricity generated from fossil fuels. Iran ranks eighth in world crude oil production and third in natural gas production yet it also possesses substantial renewable energy potential. Energy is heavily subsidized resulting in high per capita energy consumption. Iran has made limited efforts to reduce fossil fuel dependency often citing international sanctions as a hindrance to adopting cleaner energy solutions. Notably Iran remains one of three countries that have yet to ratify the Paris Agreement. There are longstanding concerns across Iran particularly Khuzestan province about the mismanagement of water resources and pollution from oil development. The Norwegian Nobel Committee awarded the 2023 Nobel Peace Prize to Narges Mohammadi for her fight against the oppression of women in Iran and her fight to promote human rights and freedom for all.  The European Parliament awarded the 2023 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Mahsa Jina Amini and the Woman Life Freedom Movement in Iran. A Special Session of the UN Human Rights Council in November 2022 created an international factfinding mission on Iran mandated to thoroughly and independently investigate alleged human rights violations in the Islamic Republic of Iran related to the protests that began on 16 September 2022 especially with respect to women and children. The factfinding mission presented an oral update in June 2023 and is scheduled to present its final report in March 2024.

https://freedomhouse.org/country/iran/freedom-world/2024, The Islamic Republic of Iran holds elections regularly but they fall short of democratic standards due in part to the influence of the hardline Guardian Council an unelected body that disqualifies all candidates it deems insufficiently loyal to the clerical establishment. Ultimate power rests in the hands of the country s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the unelected institutions under his control. These institutions including the security forces and the judiciary play a major role in the suppression of dissent and other restrictions on civil liberties. Iranian authorities have maintained a protracted crackdown after the antigovernment Woman Life Freedom protests which were sparked by the 2022 death of Jina Mahsa Amini at the hands of the morality police were held that year. The supreme leader who has no fixed term is the highest authority in the country. He is the commander in chief of the armed forces and appoints the head of the judiciary the heads of state broadcast media and the Expediency Council which mediates disputes between the Guardian Council and the parliament. He also appoints six members of the Guardian Council the other six are jurists nominated by the head of the judiciary and confirmed by the parliament all for sixyear terms. The supreme leader is appointed by the Assembly of Experts which monitors his work. However in practice his decisions appear to go unchallenged by the assembly whose proceedings are kept confidential. The current supreme leader Ali Khamenei succeeded Islamic Republic founder Ruhollah Khomeini in 1989. The president the secondhighestranking official in the Islamic Republic appoints a cabinet that must be confirmed by the parliament. He is elected by popular vote for up to two consecutive fouryear terms. Ebrahim Raisi then head of the judiciary won the presidency in 2021 with 62 percent of the vote in a heavily manipulated contest. The Guardian Council had rejected most of the nearly 600 aspiring candidates including 40 women approving only seven applicants. Among those rejected were outgoing first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri a reformist and former parliament speaker Ali Larijani a conservative. Three approved candidates dropped out several days before the poll. The election was also affected by official pressure on the media with journalists told to refrain from issuing reports that were critical of the balloting or Raisi. Voter turnout at just 48.8 percent was the lowest for a presidential election in the Islamic Republic s history. Members of the 290seat parliament are elected to fouryear terms. Elections for the body were held in 2020 with most seats going to hardliners and conservatives loyal to the supreme leader. Ahead of the vote the Guardian Council disqualified more than 9000 of the 16000 people who had registered to run including large numbers of reformist and moderate candidates. Voter turnout was the lowest for parliamentary elections in the history of the Islamic Republic. Elections for the Assembly of Experts a group of 86 clerics chosen by popular vote to serve eightyear terms were last held in 2016. Only 20 percent of the wouldbe candidates were approved to run a record low. A majority of the new assembly ultimately chose hardline cleric Ahmad Jannati head of the Guardian Council as the body s chairman. Jannati was reelected to the Assembly of Experts chairmanship in February 2023. In July 97yearold Jannati was also reelected as head of the Guardian Council. The electoral system in Iran does not meet international democratic standards. The Guardian Council controlled by hardline conservatives and ultimately by the supreme leader vets all candidates for the parliament the presidency and the Assembly of Experts. The council typically rejects candidates who are not considered insiders or deemed fully loyal to the clerical establishment as well as women seeking to run in the presidential election. As a result Iranian voters are given a strictly limited choice of candidates. Only political parties and factions loyal to the establishment and to the state ideology are permitted to operate. While some space for shifts in power between approved factions within the establishment has existed in the past the unelected components of the constitutional system represent a permanent barrier to opposition electoral victories and genuine rotations of power. Opposition figures face restrictions on their movement. Mir Hossein Mousavi Zahra Rahnavard and Mehdi Karroubi leaders of the reformist Green Movement whose protests were violently suppressed following the disputed 2009 presidential election have been under house arrest without formal charges since 2011. The choices of both voters and politicians are heavily influenced and ultimately circumscribed by Iran s unelected state institutions and ruling clerical establishment. Men from the Shiite Muslim majority population dominate the political system. Women remain significantly underrepresented in politics and government. While President Raisi appointed Ensieh Khazali as vice president for women and family affairs in September 2021 he nominated no women to serve in the cabinet the month before. No women candidates have ever been allowed to run for president. Five seats in the parliament are reserved for recognized nonMuslim minority groups Jews Armenian Christians Assyrian and Chaldean Christians and Zoroastrians. However members of nonPersian ethnic minorities and especially nonShiite religious minorities are rarely awarded senior government posts and their political representation remains weak. The elected president s powers are limited by the supreme leader and other unelected authorities. The 2021 presidential election was tightly controlled by the regime further reducing the democratic legitimacy of the executive. The powers of the elected parliament are similarly restricted by the supreme leader and the unelected Guardian Council which must approve all bills before they can become law. The council often rejects bills it deems unIslamic. Corruption remains endemic at all levels of the bureaucracy despite regular calls by authorities to tackle the problem. Powerful actors involved in the economy including the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC and bonyads endowed foundations are above scrutiny in practice and restrictions on the media and civil society activists prevent them from serving as independent watchdogs to ensure transparency and accountability. Authorities have resisted recent attempts to uncover official corruption. In June 2023 Khamenei publicly criticized the judiciary over corruption saying that a small number of officials were abusing their power. In October media reports claimed that two sons of Mohammad Mossadegh Kahnemoui the first deputy of the judiciary had been arrested in connection with an embezzlement case. The transparency of Iran s governing system is extremely limited in practice and powerful elements of the state and society are not accountable to the public. A 2009 access to information law grants broadly worded exemptions allowing the protection of information whose disclosure would conflict with state interests cause financial loss or harm public security among other stipulations. The ruling establishment has actively suppressed or manipulated information on important topics. In response to the protests triggered by the death of Jina Mahsa Amini most often referred to as Mahsa Amini in 2022 authorities tightly restricted access to related information including the number status and treatment of arrested demonstrators and other political prisoners. Authorities also restricted access to information about 16yearold Armita Geravand who fell into a coma and later died after an alleged confrontation with a hijablaw enforcer in October 2023. Human rights organizations have accused the government which insists that Geravand was not attacked but collapsed due to a sudden drop in blood pressure of orchestrating a coverup and have called for an independent investigation into Geravand s death. Media freedom is severely limited both online and offline. The state broadcasting company is tightly controlled by hardliners and influenced by the security apparatus. News and analysis are heavily censored while critics and opposition members are rarely if ever given a platform on statecontrolled television which remains a major source of information for many Iranians. State television has a record of airing confessions extracted from political prisoners under duress and it routinely carries reports aimed at discrediting dissidents and opposition activists. Newspapers and magazines face censorship and warnings from authorities about which topics to cover and how. Tens of thousands of foreignbased websites are filtered including news sites and major social media services. Satellite dishes are banned and Persianlanguage broadcasts from outside the country are regularly jammed. Police periodically raid private homes and confiscate satellite dishes. Iranian authorities have intimidated journalists working for Persianlanguage media outside the country in part by threatening their families in Iran. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ Iranian authorities have arrested approximately 100 journalists in relation to their coverage of Amini s 2022 death and the nationwide protests that followed. During 2023 journalists and sometimes their lawyers continued to face arrest arbitrary penalties and intimidation by the authorities. In October journalists Elahe Mohammadi and Niloofar Hamedi who had helped break the story of Amini s death were sentenced to 12 and 13 years in prison respectively on trumpedup charges that included collaborating with the hostile government of the United States.  Iran is home to a majority Shiite Muslim population and Sunni Muslim Baha i Christian and Zoroastrian minorities. The constitution recognizes only Zoroastrians Jews and certain Christian communities as nonMuslim religious minorities and these small groups are relatively free to worship. The regime cracks down on Muslims who are deemed to be at variance with the state ideology and interpretation of Islam. Sunni Muslims say that they have been prevented from building mosques in major cities and face difficulty obtaining government jobs. In recent years there has been increased pressure on the Sufi Muslim order Nematollahi Gonabadi including destruction of its places of worship and the jailing of some of its members. The government also subjects some nonMuslim minority groups to repressive policies and discrimination including Baha is and unrecognized Christian groups. Baha is are systematically persecuted sentenced to prison and banned from access to higher education. The clerical establishment is continuing to crack down on the Baha i faith arresting and imprisoning Baha is demolishing homes and confiscating property especially in the northern province of Mazandaran. In August 2023 the Baha i International Community reported that Iranian authorities launched a renewed crackdown over a period of several weeks. That organization counted 180 repressive incidents against Baha is during that period. In October four Baha is were sentenced to between two and five years in prison on the charge of membership in illegal groups aimed at disrupting national security.  Academic freedom remains limited in Iran. Khamenei has warned that universities should not be turned into centers for political activities. Students have been prevented from continuing their studies for political reasons or because they belong to the Baha i community. Foreign scholars visiting Iran are vulnerable to detention on trumpedup charges. Between November 2022 and March 2023 more than 1200 schoolgirls at nearly 100 schools across Iran were poisoned in what UN experts called targeted and deliberate attacks. Human rights organizations condemned Tehran for dismissing and downplaying the seriousness of attacks which continued sporadically through at least October. Many ordinary citizens speculated that the attacks may have been carried out by religious extremists or hardline regime supporters in retaliation for schoolgirls participation in the Woman Life Freedom protest movement. University professors have been dismissed in large numbers for supporting the Woman Life Freedom protests or for other political reasons. In August 2023 the Etemad newspaper reported that at least 110 academics had been fired since Raisi came to power individuals who are more closely aligned to the establishment have reportedly replaced them. In September the Center for Human Rights in Iran CHRI reported that at least 26 professors were dismissed for their apparent support of the Woman Life Freedom protests. Since Raisi became president students have reported tighter restrictions including stricter rules on wearing the hijab. As part of their efforts to suppress the nationwide protests that began in 2022 authorities have raided university campuses and arrested students in June 2023 the CHRI reported that at least 720 students were arrested since the previous September. In May 2023 an Iranian student association reported that at least 35 students at Tehran s allwomen alZahra University had been temporarily suspended from their studies since March for allegedly violating the hijab law. Score Change The score declined from 1 to 0 because the government has removed large numbers of academics from their posts and has arrested or otherwise punished scores of students as part of an ongoing crackdown on dissent. Vaguely defined restrictions on speech harsh criminal penalties and state monitoring of online communications are among several factors that deter citizens from engaging in open and free private discussion. Despite the risks and limitations many do express dissent on social media in some cases circumventing official blocks on certain platforms. However authorities have taken steps to limit the availability and usage of circumvention tools. In 2022 the Supreme Council for Cyberspace quietly implemented three articles of a draft bill under consideration by the parliament establishing a reorganized regulatory commission that included representatives of the security forces and had extensive authority over online content and services.  After mass protests began in September 2022 authorities arrested thousands of people including celebrities human rights defenders and others who had expressed support for the movement through posts on social media or by publicly disobeying the hijab requirements that had led to Amini s arrest and death. The IRGC called on the judiciary to prosecute anyone spreading false news and rumors.  Many remain in prison for peacefully challenging the clerical establishment and criticizing human rights abuses. Several individuals were arrested for their opposition to the regime in 2023. In October Etemad reported via Telegram that political activist Majid Tavakoli began serving a fiveyear prison sentence that month he had been convicted of disseminating antiregime propaganda in July. Tavakoli was initially placed under preventative arrest during the 2022 mass protests although he had not participated in the demonstrations. The constitution states that public demonstrations may be held if they are not detrimental to the fundamental principles of Islam. In practice only statesanctioned demonstrations are typically permitted while other gatherings have been forcibly dispersed by security personnel who detain and use lethal violence against participants. Protesters mounted mass demonstrations in more than 100 cities beginning in September 2022. Antigovernment protests evolved into the Woman Life Freedom movement which saw protesters call for freedom and denounce state violence against women in response to the death of Amini a 22yearold Kurdish woman who had been arrested and beaten by the socalled morality police in Tehran for allegedly wearing her hijab improperly. Authorities responded harshly security forces used water cannons and tear gas against protesters but reportedly also fired birdshot and live rounds. Officers were filmed violently beating demonstrators including women. Authorities were also accused of using rape and other sexual violence to suppress protests. In September 2023 Iran Human Rights IHR reported that at least 551 protesters had died in the ensuing violence most of them in 2022.  Ahead of the oneyear anniversary of the protests in September 2023 authorities increased pressure on dissidents activists and the family members of those killed in an attempt to prevent additional protests. Demonstrations marking the anniversary were nevertheless held and some were met with the same type of violent repression seen in 2022. Authorities also repeatedly disrupted internet access during the 2023 protests notably in the province of Sistan and Baluchistan. Nongovernmental organizations that seek to address human rights violations are generally suppressed by the state. For example the Center for Human Rights Defenders remains banned with several of its members imprisoned. Groups that focus on apolitical issues have also faced crackdowns in recent years. Iranian authorities do not permit the creation of labor unions only statesponsored labor councils are allowed. Labor rights groups have come under pressure in recent years with key leaders and activists sentenced to prison on national security charges. Workers who strike are vulnerable to dismissal and arrest. Despite such reprisals labor protests have increased in recent years due to growing economic hardship.  In June 2023 labor activist Davood Razavi was given a fiveyear discretionary prison sentence for organizing protests for improved wages and better working conditions. Razavi was also given a twoyear ban on participating in political parties and groups as well as online activities. The Tehran and Suburbs Bus Company Workers Union condemned Razavi s sentence. While the courts have a degree of autonomy within the ruling establishment the judicial system is regularly used as a tool to silence regime critics and opposition members. The head of the judiciary is appointed by the supreme leader for renewable fiveyear terms. Deputy head Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei was named to the judiciary s top post in 2021 succeeding Raisi after he was elected president. Ejei previously served as an intelligence minister and prosecutor general. Political dissidents and advocates of human and labor rights have continued to face arbitrary judgments and the security apparatus s influence over the courts has reportedly grown in recent years. The authorities routinely violate basic due process standards particularly in politically sensitive cases. Activists are arrested without warrants held indefinitely without formal charges and denied access to legal counsel or any contact with the outside world. Many are later convicted on vague security charges in trials that sometimes last only a few minutes. Some 19200 people were arrested in connection with the Woman Life Freedom protests as of January 2023 and they reportedly faced widespread due process violations. Some 25 people were sentenced to death in 2023 and many were reportedly denied access to legal counsel of their choice. At least 7 were known to have been executed as of September though Human Rights Watch HRW reported that 11 cases were overturned. In December Amnesty International separately reported that at least 5 people faced the death penalty and 15 people were at risk of receiving that sentence. Lawyers who take up the cases of dissidents have been jailed and banned from practicing and a number have been forced to leave the country to escape prosecution. During the 2022 protests authorities arrested at least 44 lawyers including defense attorneys who represented demonstrators. In August 2023 Saleh Nikbakht the Amini family s lawyer was brought before a Tehran court over accusations that he engaged in antistate propaganda. Dual nationals and those with connections abroad have also faced arbitrary detention trumpedup charges and denial of due process rights in recent years. In 2022 a Swedish diplomat working for the European Union EU Johan Floderus was arrested in Tehran and accused of spying for Israel. Swedish and EU officials have called for Floderus s release the diplomat whose trial on dubious espionage charges began in December 2023 remained in prison in Iran at year s end. Former detainees have reported being beaten during arrest and subjected to torture until they confess to crimes dictated by their interrogators. Some crimes can be formally punished with lashes in addition to imprisonment or fines. Political prisoners have repeatedly engaged in hunger strikes in recent years to protest mistreatment in custody. In 2022 Amnesty International reported that at least 88 prisoners had died in custody from torture the use of firearms or tear gas or other illtreatment since 2010 while 96 prisoners had died from being denied adequate medical care. Prisons are overcrowded and prisoners often complain of poor detention conditions including denial of medical care. Video recordings taken in Evin prison and distributed in 2021 captured incidents in which prisoners were assaulted or mistreated along with evidence of overcrowding. In 2022 a series of fires destroyed parts of Evin prison under unclear circumstances killing at least eight people. Security forces reportedly attacked prisoners who attempted to flee the blazes. Iran has generally been second only to China in the number of executions it carries out putting hundreds of people to death each year. Convicts can be executed for offenses other than murder such as drug trafficking and for crimes they committed when they were younger than 18 years old. The number of executions has increased since Raisi became president. Executions for drugrelated offenses disproportionately impact people from marginalized communities. According to Amnesty International Iranian authorities executed at least 173 people convicted of drugrelated charges in the first five months of 2023 accounting for twothirds of all death sentences carried out in that period. According to a UN report released in November authorities executed at least 419 people in the first seven months of the year a 30 percent increase over the same period in 2022. In addition to the violence stemming directly from state repression the country faces a longterm security threat from terrorist and insurgent groups that recruit among disadvantaged Kurdish Arab and Sunni Muslim minority populations. Women do not receive equal treatment under the law and face widespread discrimination in practice. For example a woman s testimony in court is given half the weight of a man s and the monetary compensation awarded to a female victim s family upon her death is half that owed to the family of a male victim. A majority of the population is of Persian ethnicity and members of ethnic minorities experience various forms of discrimination including restrictions on the use of their languages. Some provinces with large nonPersian populations remain underdeveloped. Activists campaigning for the rights of ethnic minority groups and greater autonomy for their respective regions have come under pressure from the authorities and some have been jailed. The Kurdish population played an important role in the 2022 protests triggered by the death of Amini who was Kurdish and the state crackdown was especially heavy in Kurdish areas. Disproportionate numbers of protestrelated deaths were also reported in Sistan and Baluchistan Province where Sunni Muslim ethnic Baluch residents form a majority. LGBT people face harassment and discrimination though the problem is underreported due to the criminalized and hidden nature of this community in Iran. The penal code criminalizes all sexual relations outside of traditional marriage and Iran is among the few countries where individuals can be put to death for consensual samesex conduct. Freedom of movement is restricted particularly for women and perceived opponents of the regime. Many journalists and activists have been prevented from leaving the country. Women are banned from certain public places and can generally obtain a passport to travel abroad only with the permission of their fathers or husbands. Women had been barred from attending soccer matches in stadiums since the 1979 revolution but in recent years a limited number of women have been allowed into stadiums for international matches amid increased pressure on Iran to remove the ban. Iranians have the legal right to own property and establish private businesses. However powerful institutions like the IRGC play a dominant role in the economy limiting fair competition and opportunities for entrepreneurs and bribery is said to be widespread in the business environment including for registration and obtaining licenses. Women are denied equal rights in inheritance matters.  During 2023 authorities shut down dozens of cafes restaurants and other businesses for allegedly failing to comply with the mandatory hijab law. Business owners have also faced reprisals for supporting the Woman Life Freedom protest movement including restrictions on access to banking services. Social freedoms are restricted in Iran. All residents but particularly women are subject to obligatory rules on dress and personal appearance and those who are deemed to have violated the rules face state harassment fines and arrest. Following Amini s death in 2022 an increasing number of women appeared in public without their headscarves as an act of civil disobedience. Dozens were arrested including several prominent actresses. In September 2023 the parliament approved a bill that would impose heavier penalties including steeper fines and longer prison terms on women who do not wear the hijab. The Guardian Council which must approve the bill before it becomes law returned the draft legislation to the parliament for further review in October though the Expediency Council upheld it in midDecember. The bill has drawn intense criticism from human rights defenders for its severity and the possibility that it would be violently enforced. Women were also warned that they could be denied access to banking services and public transport for violating rules on dress.  Police have long conducted raids on private gatherings that breach rules against alcohol consumption and the mixing of unrelated men and women. Those attending can be detained and fined or sentenced to corporal punishment in the form of lashes. Women do not enjoy equal rights in divorce and child custody disputes. Abortion is permitted within the first four months of a pregnancy if three doctors decide that the mother s life is at risk or if the fetus shows signs of severe disability. The judiciary has increased its efforts to restrict abortions in recent years. In 2021 the Guardian Council ratified a law strengthening enforcement of abortion restrictions and establishing a committee that includes judicial representatives Islamic jurists doctors and legislators to develop new regulations. The law also bans voluntary sterilization and the distribution of free contraceptives. In August 2023 a midwife was arrested in Qom for allegedly performing an illegal abortion and her clinic was shuttered. According to the Shargh newspaper official reports indicate that 165 women were killed by male family members between July 2021 and July 2023 though experts believe the actual number is significantly higher. The government provides no protection to women and children forced into sex trafficking and both Iranians and migrant workers from countries like Afghanistan are subject to forced labor and debt bondage. The IRGC has allegedly used coercive tactics to recruit thousands of Afghan migrants living in Iran to fight in Syria. HRW has reported that children as young as 14 are among those recruited. The population faces widespread economic hardship driven by a combination of USled trade sanctions and mismanagement by the regime. The crisis has resulted in the rapid devaluation of the national currency and soaring prices for basic goods. In 2022 Alena Douhan the UN special rapporteur on the negative impact of the unilateral coercive measures reported that sanctions on Iran affected most aspects of life in the country and called for them to be lifted.

https://iranprimer.usip.org/blog/2023/nov/17/iran-2024-political-challenges, The main challenges for the government are maintaining political stability and stabilizing the dire economic situation especially the very high inflation rate. Officials understand that the legitimacy of the regime has eroded especially since the brutal crackdown on nationwide demonstrations sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody in 2022. The government wants to avoid any flashpoints that could push Iranians to take to the streets again. The government is focused on keeping its core constituency in line but it is also trying to bring people on the margins into the fold of supporters of the Islamic Republic. For example state media has produced new television shows and brought on a wider variety of guests to discuss sensitive political issues. The government wants to appear responsive and sympathetic to maintain a degree of legitimacy while balancing security considerations. The economic crisis is the main concern. As of 2022 some 60 percent of Iranians were reportedly living at or below the poverty line. Inflation fluctuated between 39 and 56 percent during the first nine months of 2023. The cumulative impact of U.S. sanctions fluctuating oil prices mismanagement and rampant corruption have impacted all strata of society. The middle class once robust has been shrinking as families struggle to deal with the high cost of living. In early 2023 Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei admitted that Iran s economy was a decade behind. Rapid growth is absolutely crucial in order to solve the tangible problems associated with people s livelihood and the difficulties experienced in households he said in a televised speech. Khamenei called the high unemployment some 22 percent in early 2023 a disgrace. We keep asking ourselves why these people are leaving. Why do they move abroad? Well you need to give them jobs he said. But the poor economic conditions have not yet triggered a substantive public debate over economic policy. The Guardian Council which is responsible for vetting all candidates for public office narrowed the political space in the 2020 election by approving just 43 percent of candidates to run. Most reformists and many centrists including incumbents were disqualified. If the same happens ahead of the 2024 elections which seems to be the case conservative candidates from different factions may not differ much on macroeconomic policy. Many races may come down to localized issues. Prospects for a higher turnout in 2024 are dim. Iranians appear apathetic about the elections. In previous years the registration period and debates about the Guardian Council s vetting of candidates would generate excitement and its own news cycle. Wellknown politicians would sign up knowing full well that they would probably be disqualified and then support lesserknown candidates. But that did not happen this time. Three former presidents and three former parliamentary speakers who might have been key players announced that they would not run. Some reformists have urged Iranians to stay away from the polls in 2024. Faezeh Hashemi a former lawmaker 19962000 and the daughter of the late President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani called for a boycott from notorious Evin prison in July 2023. She was serving a fiveyear sentence for propaganda against the regime and participating in antigovernment protests. If we break our spell and don t participate in elections we can make the rulers path difficult by spreading the truth and force them to change policies and finally take back the power we have given them Hashemi wrote in a letter. Javad Emam the spokesman for the Reform Front a major reformist faction criticized the registration and vetting process in October 2023. We have no issues with the ballot box as it represents the will of the nation. However regrettably the people have been denied the opportunity for a fair electoral process through the ballot boxes he told local media. We as reformists find it challenging to engage peoples interest in participating in elections. Other reformists within the broad coalition have proposed individuals should make their own decisions and vote. The turnout may also be limited by demographic trends. The population is aging. The fertility rate was more than six births per woman during the first half of the 1980s but fell to just two by 2000 according to U.N. data. The fertility rate was down to 1.7 as of 2021. Not only are fewer new voters coming of age millennials and Gen Zers are less likely to vote than previous generations. Yet officials did not seem to be very perturbed by the possibility of low turnout again. For decades after 1979 senior leaders had cited high turnout rates as proof of legitimacy and public support for the Islamic Republic. For example the turnout for the 1996 parliamentary election was 71 percent and the turnout for the 2009 presidential election was 85 percent. But now the regime favors predictability and stability over a diverse candidate pool that could bring out voters. Two factions of conservatives are set to shape Iranian politics in 2024. The first is the Paydari Steadfastness Front which espouses puritanical views. Its members favor a statecontrolled economy and proclaim to be committed to social justice especially rooting out corruption and making government more efficient. They are more hawkish on foreign policy and want Iran to grow closer to nonWestern powers namely China and Russia. Many members of President Ebrahim Raisi s cabinet align with the Paydari Front. The second faction includes traditional or mainstream conservatives led by Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf parliament s speaker for the 20202024 term. Qalibaf has solid credentials including decorated service during the 19801988 war with Iraq. He was commander of the Revolutionary Guards Air Force from 1996 to 1999 national police chief from 2000 to 2005 and mayor of Tehran from 2005 to 2017.  Qalibaf and other traditional conservatives tend to be more pragmatic and less ideological. Many come from the bazaari merchant class and favor a stronger private sector instead of a statecontrolled economy. Traditional conservatives are more willing to open the political space. They recognize that allowing some reformists back into electoral politics could make debates more vibrant and the Islamic Republic more resilient. They are also more open to engagement with the outside world including European countries. Some traditional conservatives supported the 2015 nuclear deal with the world s six major powers. But they have been less vocal as domestic politics have become polarized and Iran has been isolated over its human rights record controversial nuclear program and support for Russia s war in Ukraine. Very few reformists or centrists with national name recognition have registered to run. Former Vice President Mohammad Baqer Nobakht who served in the centrist administration of President Hassan Rouhani 20132021 is one of the more prominent candidates outside of the conservative camp but he is not a major factor in the election. Discontent is widespread but there is little appetite for challenging the government. The public witnessed the crackdown on antigovernment protests in 2022 and lost hope for meaningful change. People are also largely focused on their own livelihoods and daytoday problems. A sudden change in subsidies could trigger a new round of protests. Many people are especially concerned that the government will cut back on fuel subsidies. The price of a liter of drinking water is more than a liter of gasoline. Everyone recognizes that the low prices are unsustainable but politicians have long hesitated to implement substantive reforms for fear of sparking unrest. In 2019 an overnight hike in fuel prices and the introduction of a new rationing system triggered demonstrations in at least 100 cities across Iran. More than 300 people were killed in clashes with security forces and at least 7000 were detained. The other issue that could reignite public anger is further encroachment on personal freedoms. The government redeployed the morality police in mid2023 but enforcement of the Islamic dress code has been uneven. Many women still go unveiled in shopping centers and metro stations in major cities especially in Tehran. Political factions are positioning themselves for succession although the topic is rarely discussed in public. The state bureaucracy especially the Office of the Supreme Leader will have a lot of influence over the succession. But other power centers especially the Revolutionary Guards and political factions will try to steer the process as well.  Khamenei has not shown any obvious signs that he is in poor health so the transition may not come for years. If he were to suddenly die or become too sick to fulfill his duties there is no obvious successor. The pool of known candidates is small. And none of the men speculated to be potential contenders such as Khamenei s son Mojtaba or President Raisi have strong bases of support or remarkable leadership qualities. The upcoming Assembly of Experts election is important mainly because of the looming succession. Usually most of the candidates are elderly and conservative clerics who do not have national name recognition. But this year could be different especially if the Guardian Council is more lenient about qualifying a more diverse pool of the 510 candidates who registered. One contender to watch is former President Hassan Rouhani 20132021. Rouhani was first elected to the assembly in 2000 and was reelected in 2007 and 2016. The centrist has held several ranking positions including Secretary of the Supreme National Security Council 19892005. During his tenure as president he tried to expand freedoms in the press speech education and individual rights. He favored engagement with the outside world including the West. The 2024 U.S. presidential election will have the greatest impact on prospects for diplomacy. If Biden is reelected Tehran may be willing to engage with Washington on the nuclear issue or other topics knowing that U.S. policy will be predictable for at least four years. If someone more hawkish wins the chances for escalation may increase.  Iran s parliamentary and presidential elections will be less consequential for diplomacy. The decisionmaking process is based on consensus and Supreme Leader Khamenei has the final say on major issues. President Raisi is expected to seek reelection and win in 2025 because the last five presidents all won two consecutive terms. Raisi s negotiating team failed to reach a nuclear deal in indirect talks with the United States between 2021 and 2023 but the two countries did complete a rare prisoner swap in September 2023 after more than a year of quiet diplomacy. So at least there is some precedent for engagement with Washington.

Powell and Maureen Chowdhury Adam Renton and Elizabeth Wolfe CNN The attack on Iran early Friday was likely intended as both a retaliatory measure and a cautionary message a retired US Army Major General told CNN.  For days Israel has been weighing its response to unprecedented weekend strikes from Iran which were launched in retaliation for a suspected Israeli strike on its embassy compound in Syria earlier this month.  A US official told CNN that Fridays attack was an Israeli strike. Israel has declined to comment on it.   Israel must maintain its vigilance in case Iran decides to respond with another show of force retired Major General Mark MacCarley said.  By targeting the Iranian province of Isfahan the site of significant nuclear facilities Israel was likely warning that it could easily overwhelm Irans defenses MacCarley said.   I think that there was a very deliberate thought process on the part of the Israeli war cabinet he said.  A loud blast heard near the Iranian city of Isfahan was caused by air defense firing at a suspicious object an Iranian senior military commander said according to Irans statealigned Tasnim news agency. There was no damage or incident said senior military commander Second Brigadier General Mihandoust in Isfahan Province according to Tasnim. A US official told CNN that Israel had carried out a strike inside Iran. The Israeli military has not commented.  Iranian state media are reporting that all facilities in the area are secure including significant nuclear facilities. Three explosions were heard early Friday near the military base where fighter jets are located in the Isfahan province Irans semiofficial FARS news agency reported. Israel has carried out a strike inside Iran a US official told CNN on Friday in a move that threatens to further escalate conflict in the Middle East.  Iran s air defense systems were activated in several locations after explosions were heard close to the airport and an army base in the province of Isfahan state media reported early Friday morning. Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack. Iran has lifted flight suspensions put in place after reports of explosions near a military base in Isfahan province according to the spokesperson of the Civil Aviation Organization. Flights have resumed at Mehrabad Airport and Imam Khomeini International Airport the two major airports in Irans capital Tehran after being suspended earlier today.  Iran had earlier temporarily suspended all flights heading to the cities of Tehran Isfahan and Shiraz the airports of the West North West and South West staterun Mehr TV reported. Outgoing flights were also briefly canceled. Following a strike in Irans Isfahan province Iranian state media are reporting that all facilities in the area are secure including significant nuclear facilities CNN International Diplomatic Editor Nic Robertson reports.  Though a US official told CNN Israel has carried out a strike inside Iran Israel has not taken responsibility for the attack. State media is also reporting that they have not had any enemy aircraft come into Iranian airspace he added. A flight from Dubai to Tehran was diverted back to the United Arab Emirates on Friday morning after Tehrans Imam Khomeini International Airport closed.  A Flydubai spokesperson told CNN that flights from Dubai to Iran had been canceled.  The flight left for Dubai at 410 a.m. 810 p.m. ET and arrived back in Dubai at 551 a.m. 951 a.m. ET.  US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Israeli Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant earlier Thursday about regional threats and Iran s destabilizing actions in the Middle East according to a Pentagon readout. The call happened before Israel carried out a strike inside Iran. The Pentagon readout does not mention any discussion of Israel s plans to attack. Austin also discussed the importance of increasing and sustaining the flow of humanitarian aid to Gazan civilians including via the new route from Ashdod Port in Israel the readout said. CNN reported Thursday night that Israel had told the US that it would be retaliating against Iran in the coming days according to a senior US official. Iranian air defenses shot down three drones Friday according to a Tehran official as state media said no largescale strikes or explosions had been reported following blasts near the central city of Isfahan. Irans air defense systems were activated in several regions as a precaution against potential aerial threats according to state news agency IRNA. Extensive checks in Isfahan a critical central province with significant nuclear facilities indicate that all sensitive military and security installations remain secure with no incidents reported.,
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/2/conservatives-dominate-irans-parliament-assembly-elections, Tehran Iran A range of conservative candidates have swept the parliamentary and religious assembly elections in Iran as the country faces political and economic challenges. Final vote counting is under way after millions went to the polls on Friday to select 290 lawmakers and 88 members of the Assembly of Experts a body tasked with choosing the supreme leader made up entirely of Islamic scholars. Official preliminary results from Tehran on Saturday indicate that ultraconservatives Mahmoud Nabavian and Hamid Resaee have topped the list of 30 representatives followed by 35yearold state television host turned firsttime lawmaker Amir Hossein Sabeti. Parliament chief Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf finished fourth and only a handful of his sponsored candidates ascended. Longtime lawmaker Mojtaba Zonnour grabbed a seat in the holy Shia city of Qom. Few reformist or moderate voices managed to secure entry into parliament marking the second parliamentary election in which they were largely absent. Veteran lawmaker Masoud Pezeshkian was among few moderates who managed to get approved by the constitutional watchdog Guardian Council and secure votes and will represent Tabriz in the 12th parliament. Ali Motahari conservative former parliamentarian and son of renowned late scholar Morteza Motahari who has become a more moderate politician compared with other legislators failed along with most members of his 30strong list for Tehran to come close to securing a seat. President Ebrahim Raisi comfortably renewed his place at the Assembly of Experts for a third time securing more than 82 percent of the vote in the South Khorasan province located in eastern Iran. The president was initially running without any opponent after the Guardian Council disqualified other candidates but one candidate ended up changing his district to ceremonially run against Raisi for a place in the sixth term of the assembly which will last till mid3032. Ultraconservative Ahmad Khatami a current imam of Friday prayers in Tehran has again secured a place at the assembly from the province of Kerman and Mohammad Saeedi is Qom s representative. Local media said with over 834000 votes Mohammad Ali AleHashem the supreme leader s representative in Tabriz recorded the highest number of votes ever for an assembly winner emerging victorious in the province of East Azerbaijan. Sadegh Amoli Larijani a senior member of the influential Larijani family and current head of the top arbitration body known as the Expediency Council was perhaps the most notable snub from the assembly. Candidates have until Thursday to formally declare any complaints Guardian Council spokesman Tahan Nazif said on Saturday. The elections were held across 59000 voting stations across Iran with 6800 in the province of Tehran which includes the capital and several surrounding cities. The Ministry of Interior extended voting time three times until midnight on Friday sending text messages to voters that a rush of people at polling stations has kept them open. But many conversations surrounding the elections whether for or against were marked by discussions around low turnout in the first elections since the country s 20222023 nationwide protests and as Iran s economy squeezed by United States sanctions has continued to grapple with high inflation. Results are not final yet but statelinked media reported on Saturday that some 25 million Iranians voted which they hailed as a huge defeat for what they called a campaign to boycott the elections run by antiestablishment elements. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps IRGC on Saturday thanked Iranians for their glorious participation in the elections in a statement saying it was a decisive response to enemies . That number would put turnout at about 40 percent of 61.2 million eligible voters roughly on par with the 2020 election which had put lawmakers into parliament with a 42percent turnout the lowest in the history of Iran since the country s 1979 revolution. In Tehran a city with some 7.7 million eligible voters roughly a quarter are believed to have voted pending final results. Iran s currency the rial continued to fall on Saturday extending a downward trend since the start of 2024 that has in part reflected concerns over expanding military confrontations between the axis of resistance supported by Iran across the region and the coalition led by the US. The rial hit a low of around 600000 per the US dollar in the open market at the start of the Iranian week on Saturday a figure it had dipped to in late February 2023 before regaining some ground.,

Majid SaeediGetty Images CNN Iran has recorded the lowest electoral turnout since the Islamic Republic s founding in 1979 with officials portraying the participation of those who did vote as a victory against the country s obstinate opponents.   Out of Iran s 61 million eligible voters some 25 million cast their ballots in parliamentary and Assembly of Experts elections that took place on March 1 Iran s state news outlet IRNA said.   The announced turnout is not final experts say. And while only 41 of voters came out according to official data the real turnout is likely lower although it is impossible to know at this stage wrote Alex Vatanka founding director of the Iran Program at the Middle East Institute in Washington DC adding that in this round the vetting was among the most extreme.   Turnout was low despite Iran extending the voting time three times and despite weekslong efforts by officials to boost participation levels ahead of the polling date.   A man watches a video of Iranian singer Shervin Hajipour in the Cypriot capital Nicosia on October 4 2022. Khaled DesoukiAFPGetty Images Related article Iranian pop star who sang protest anthem jailed and ordered to write antiUS song rights group says   The turnout also comes as Iranians grapple with a tumbling local currency a crippled economy and widened crackdown on dissent which rights groups say only intensified after the 2022 protest movement sparked by the death of Mahsa Amini in police custody.   Iranian officials and state media however hailed the turnout as a triumph. The figure is a win against the biggest election boycott campaign in the last 45 years said Iran s semiofficial Fars news agency on X adding that the boycott was orchestrated by foreign enemies and their internal followers.   President Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday told Iranians who voted that their participation was a zealous blow to Iran s obstinate opponents.   While not as low as some polls published in state media initially speculated the turnout so far announced is lower than any legislative or presidential election held since the Islamic Republic s founding in 1979.   It is unclear if the announced 41 turnout will sink further in the coming days with some candidates in the parliamentary election going to a runoff.   Recent elections have generally seen increasingly low rates of voter participation. Iran s last parliamentary election in 2020 saw a turnout of 42.57 and its last presidential election in 2021 had a turnout of 48.8 both were the lowest since the establishment of the Islamic Republic.   Some 15000 candidates competed last week for the 290seat parliamentary election and 144 ran for the 88 seats of the Assembly of Experts.   Preliminary results show the election of mostly hardline politicians including President Ebrahim Raisi who was reelected to the Assembly of Experts which has the power to appoint the Supreme Leader the highest political authority in Iran.   Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi casts his vote at a Tehran polling station March 1 2024. Hossein BerisMiddle East ImagesAFP via Getty Images Key takeaways Several Iranians in Tehran have cited economic conditions and a lack of trust in leadership as reasons for not voting.   In a shocking move Iran s former president Mohammad Khatami refused to cast his vote on March 1. The reformist president has previously urged the Iranian government to be more lenient with protesters amid the 2022 nationwide demonstrations. Azar Mansouri an Iranian reformist politician over the weekend confirmed Khatami s refusal to vote.   His Khatami critical stance is indicative of the mood in the reformist camp that is by now nearly extinguished as a channel for criticism of Khamenei Vatanka wrote.   International watchdogs previously slammed Iran for holding elections that are neither free nor fair marked by a vetting process that restricts the types of candidates permitted to run.   This year Iran s Guardian Council a powerful 12member council charged with overseeing elections and legislation had disqualified thousands of candidates from running for parliamentary seats and barred former moderate President Hassan Rouhani from running for the Assembly of Experts.   Some 25 million people cast their ballots out of Irans 61 million eligible voters. Atta KenareAFP via Getty Images Other politicians who were once leading election charts saw their popularity drop. Mohammad Bagher Ghalibaf Iran s parliament speaker and former Revolutionary Guards air force commander seemed to lose some votes coming fourth in this year s election after his popularity peaked in the 2020 parliamentary election.   Ghalibaf s fall down the chart shows that even among those who did vote they are taking a more striking position against perhaps incumbents and even pragmatic conservatives Sanam Vakil director of the Middle East and North Africa Programme at the Chatham House think tank in London told CNN.   Vakil added that another sign of voter discontent was the high number of spoiled ballots showing that there were protesters even among those who voted.   The real question now is what comes next Vatanka wrote adding that for a majority of Iranians this election was a referendum on the future of the Islamic Republic.   Few reformists chose to or were able to run in these elections and those that did fared badly marking the loss of the public s faith in the ability of gradual reform in the Islamic Republic he added.   This election tells us where the system is Vakil told CNN adding that in an attempt to maintain cohesion for succession and the existing composition of the Islamic Republic s institutions the system has been purged of elites who may have become more pragmatic or moderate over time.

AP Photo JERUSALEM AP Israel and Iran on Friday both played down an apparent Israeli airstrike near a major air base and nuclear site in central Iran signaling the two bitter enemies are ready to prevent their latest eruption of violence from escalating into a fullblown regional war. But the indecisive outcome of weeks of tensions which included an alleged Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals an unprecedented Iranian missile barrage on Israel and the apparent Israeli strike early Friday in the heart of Iran did little to resolve the deeper grievances between the foes and left the door open to further fighting.  It appears we re closer than ever to a broad regional war despite the fact that the international community will most likely make a great effort to deescalate tensions wrote Amos Harel the militaryaffairs commentator for the Israeli daily Haaretz. Israel has long considered Iran to be its greatest enemy citing the Islamic Republic s calls for Israel s destruction its controversial nuclear program and its support for hostile proxies across the Middle East. These tensions have risen since Hamas and Islamic Jihad Iranianbacked Palestinian groups attacked Israel on Oct. 7 sparking a devastating Israeli offensive in Gaza that has continued for more than six months. Hezbollah an Iranianbacked proxy in Lebanon immediately began striking Israeli targets opening up titfortat fighting along a second front while Iranianbacked militias in Iraq Syria and Yemen have also fired missiles and drones at Israel throughout the war. While Israel and Iran have waged a shadow war for years mostly in neighboring Syria they have largely avoided direct confrontations. That changed after an April 1 airstrike killed two Iranian generals at an Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Although Israel did not comment Iran blamed Israel for the strike and vowed revenge. Iran responded with its firstever direct attack on Israel launching over 300 missiles and attack drones late Saturday night. Israel working with a U.S.led international coalition said it intercepted 99 of the incoming fire though a handful of missiles managed to land causing minor damage to an Israeli military base and seriously wounding a young girl. In Friday s attack Iranian state television said that air defense batteries fired in several provinces over reports of drones in the air. Iranian army commander Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi said crews targeted several flying objects.  The explosion this morning in the sky of Isfahan was related to the shooting of air defense systems at a suspicious object that did not cause any damage Mousavi said.   The Latest World leaders call on Iran and Israel to avoid allowing conflict to worsen US and UK issue new sanctions on Iran in response to Tehran s weekend attack on Israel Congress moving swiftly on bipartisan action to punish Iran after revenge attack on Israel Authorities said air defenses fired at a major air base near Isfahan which long has been home to Iran s fleet of Americanmade F14 Tomcats purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Isfahan also is home to sites associated with Iran s nuclear program including its underground Natanz enrichment site which has been repeatedly targeted by suspected Israeli sabotage attacks. The apparent attack Friday came on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei s 85th birthday. State television described all Iranian atomic sites in the areas as fully safe. The United Nations nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency also said there was no damage to Iran s nuclear sites. Iranian officials made no mention of possible Israeli involvement. That could be intentional particularly after Iranian officials for days have been threatening to respond to any Israeli retaliatory attack.  Israel also had no comment on the apparent attack though one hardline government minister Itamar BenGvir hinted at his dissatisfaction with a oneword tweet early Friday using a slang word for weak or lame. But Italy s foreign minister Antonio Tajani said at a summit of Western leaders in Capri that the U.S. received lastminute information from Israel about the attack. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not dispute that but said We were not involved in any offensive operations.  Yoel Guzansky a former Iran expert in the Israeli prime minister s office said Israel appears to have carried out the attack to check off a box by sending a message to Iran without doing anything too provocative that could upset the United States which had urged restraint or spark further Iranian retaliation.  It seems very limited to send a message that we can strike you inside of Iran said Guzansky a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies a Tel Aviv think tank. He said the current round of violence appears to be over but that nothing has changed with Israel still facing Iranianbacked threats on various fronts.  I see further rounds he said. And the next time if Iran surprises Israel or allies don t assist in Israel s defense the outcome will be different.  U.N. SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres called for an end to the strikes.  It is high time to stop the dangerous cycle of retaliation in the Middle East his office said. Charles Lister a senior fellow at the Washingtonbased Middle East Institute and a longtime regional analyst challenged Iran s claims that drones carried out the attacks. It appears instead that a small number of Israeli aircraft flew from Israel over Syria striking at least two southern Syria military bases that have air defense systems along the way he said.  They then entered Iraqi airspace from where they fired a small number of Blue Sparrow airtosurface ballistic missiles likely without ever entering Iranian airspace Lister said. Accounts of explosions over Iraq support that scenario and so does debris from what appears to be the booster of an Israelimade Blue Sparrow missile that Iraqi security found in a field outside Baghdad Lister said.  In other words the Israelis would never have needed to enter Iranian airspace to conduct this attack Lister said. I think this was Israel s way of just sending a message that we can reach you anywhere we want.  If this latest round subsides Israel can now return its focus to its ongoing war in Gaza and the simmering fighting with Hezbollah. With neither of those fronts letting up the risk of further runins with Iran remains high though neither side appears eager after Friday s apparent Israeli attack.

AP PhotoVahid Salemi  Neither side is ready to jump over the brink said Alex Vatanka director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute. But he added a major caveat.  Probably we re going to go back to the proxy war he said but now it s a proxy war with the risk of that sudden eruption of statetostate war. Which we didn t have to worry about before.

I condemn these attacks in the strongest possible terms. At my direction to support the defense of Israel the U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.  I ve just spoken with Prime Minister Netanyahu to reaffirm America s ironclad commitment to the security of Israel. I told him that Israel demonstrated a remarkable capacity to defend against and defeat even unprecedented attacks sending a clear message to its foes that they cannot effectively threaten the security of Israel. Tomorrow I will convene my fellow G7 leaders to coordinate a united diplomatic response to Iran s brazen attack. My team will engage with their counterparts across the region. And we will stay in close touch with Israel s leaders. And while we have not seen attacks on our forces or facilities today we will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/19/israel-iran-hamas-war-news-gaza-palestine/, Secretary of State Antony Blinken declined to comment on whether Washington was warned about the strike but emphasized that the United States has not been involved in any offensive operations. U.S. officials at multiple government agencies told The Washington Post that the Biden administration instructed them not to speak publicly about the strike. The war On Oct. 7 Hamas militants launched an unprecedented crossborder attack on Israel that included the taking of civilian hostages at a music festival. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel s creation in 1948. Gaza crisis In the Gaza Strip Israel has waged one of this century s most destructive wars killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into faminelike conditions. For months Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave. U.S. involvement Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians including President Biden the United States supports Israel with weapons funds aid packages and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations ceasefire resolutions. History The roots of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Read more on the history of the Gaza Strip.,

In recent years Iran has been swept by protests and waning government legitimacy. In September 2022 a 22yearold Kurdish Iranian woman named Mahsa Amini died in the custody of Iran s morality police who had arrested her for allegedly violating the country s mandatory hijab policy. The events provoked months of Gen Zled civic outrage that briefly challenged but ultimately emboldened Tehran s clerical regime under the leadership of President Ebrahim Raisi and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. The ultraconservative Raisi was elected in 2021 in a process that FP s Ravi Agrawal called unfree unfair and preordained. Iran s Guardian Council a religious constitutional body that approves all candidates for office had eliminated any viable challenges to Raisi who was favored by Khamenei to succeed more moderate thenPresident Hassan Rouhani. In an interview with Agrawal the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace s Karim Sadjadpour referred to Raisi as an obsequious protege of and a heat seekingmissile for Khamenei s ass.  Elections to Watch in 2024 This story is part of a package on 15 key elections this year besides the United States. Read the full analysis here.  Raisi s presidency has been tumultuous. In addition to the Mahsa Amini protests Iranians are upset about the state of the country s economy. As of 2022 30 percent of Iranian households were living below the poverty line amid rampant inflation and heavy U.S. sanctions. Though Raisi mended ties with longtime foe Saudi Arabia tensions with adversaries Israel and the United States have soared particularly amid the latter s ongoing war with Hamas a militant group that receives funding from Tehran. This year Khamenei is seeking to solidify his control over Iran s institutions in legislative elections that will see Iranians elect all 290 seats in the Majlis the country s representative parliament and all 88 members of the Assembly of Experts which appoints the supreme leader. Most observers agree that the Majlis has little policymaking authority and serves instead to rubberstamp decisions made by Raisi and Khamenei. The Washington Institute for Near East Policy cited a July 2023 poll by state media that 68 percent of Iranians are dissatisfied with the parliament. Majlis members serve fouryear terms voter turnout during the last Majlis election in 2020 held mostly before the onset of the pandemic was a little more than 42 percent. The Majlis is dominated by two conservative factions Raisi s hardline ideological Steadfastness Front and a more mainstream pragmatic group led by Speaker Mohammad Bagher Qalibaf. The Assembly of Experts which meets just twice per calendar year could have more sway over the future of Iranian politics. That s because Khamenei is 84 years old. If he were to die over the next eight years the length of a term in the assembly it would be charged with choosing his successor. Khamenei seems to be angling for his son Mojtaba Khamenei to take over but Rouhani is also considered to be a potential contender. Rouhani appears to be reading a candidacy for the assembly which he was a member of before becoming president in 2013. During the last assembly election in 2016 the Guardian Council disqualified 80 percent of candidates to the Assembly of Experts. All of the council s current members are men and almost all are over the age of 50. Only one is not a cleric. The rejection rate for Majlis contenders is lower During a oneweek preregistration period in August 2023 Iranian authorities reported receiving a record 49000 candidate applications. By Nov. 18 2023 regularphase registrations numbered almost 25000 according to Voice of America with a rejection rate of about 28 percent. Regardless of how many candidates make the ballot for both the Majlis and Assembly of Experts the more consequential question is whether Iran s reformists will boycott the vote. For Raisi and Khamenei low turnout could be a doubleedged sword. A reformist boycott would almost guarantee their hardline camp a victory. But by laying bare their government s waning public legitimacy it would also make them look weaker than ever.  Allison Meakem is an associate editor at Foreign Policy.

https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-iran-gaza-conflict-news-04-19-24/index.html, Live Live Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made no mention of Israels Friday local time strike on Iran while publicly lauding the unprecedented Iranian military operation last weekend targeting the Israelioccupied territories. Irans April 13 retaliatory strikes part of an operation named True Promise were a display of Irans military strength and a necessary act against what Raisi called the illegal regime he said Friday.  Raisi described the strikes as punitive reprisal by the Iranian Armed Forces aimed at demonstrating Irans power and the resolve of its people.  Remember The on April 1 strikes on Irans embassy compound in Damascus demolished a building and left several dead including two highranking generals. Israel and the United States have said that Irans lob of some 300 missiles had very little material impact and caused only one injury. At least three members of the Iranianbacked Popular Mobilization Units or PMU also called Popular Mobilization Forces or PMF were wounded following five explosions at a military base south of Baghdad said Muhannad alAnazi member of the Security Committee in Babylon Governorate in a statement in the early hours of Saturday local time. A short statement released by the PMU acknowledged there was an explosion that occurred at the headquarters of the Popular Mobilization Forces at the Kalsu military base in the AlMashrou district on the highway north of the Babylon Governorate. An investigation team arrived at the scene and the explosion caused material losses and injuries the PMU said. We will provide you with the details once the preliminary investigation is completed it added. Israel has no involvement in the reports of explosions in Iraq on Friday evening an Israeli official told CNN.  The US Central Command said the US did not carry out strikes in Iraq. The Combined Joint Task Force that leads Operation Inherent Resolve which is the ongoing multinational mission to defeat ISIS also said the USled coalition did not carry out any strikes in Iraq. Remember The explosions near the Iraqi capital of Baghdad come one day after strikes against a military base in Isfahan Iran. A US official told CNN that Israel was responsible for the strikes in Iran. This post has been updated with comments from an Israeli and US official. The aftermath of the Israeli strikes in Iran left the world on edge as concerns of a potentially dangerous escalation of a fastwidening Middle East conflict continue to rise.  Heres the immediate response almost 24 hours after the strikes  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with his Israeli counterpart on Friday according to a readout from the Pentagon. This comes one day after Israel carried out strikes in Iran. The readout makes no mention of the Israeli strikes and the Biden administration has been tightlipped following the actions.  Austin and Israel Defense Minister Yoav Gallant discussed regional stability as well as the ongoing war in Gaza according to the Pentagon. Austin also spoke with Gallant on Thursday before the strikes took place. The readout of the earlier call had slightly more information saying the two discussed Iran s destabilizing actions in the Middle East.  In a previous call Austin had asked Gallant for Israel to notify the US before taking any action in retaliation for a massive Iranian barrage fired at Israel last weekend. The scope of Israel s military response to Iran s firstever direct attack on the country remains murky. Israeli officials have yet to publicly acknowledge responsibility for reported overnight explosions in parts of Iran on Friday. Tehran has dismissed these as attacks by tiny drones that were shot down by its air defense systems. Iran may be downplaying what was likely to have been a significant but limited Israeli attack but that seems to be secondary to the larger forces at play. What is plain to see is that both Iran and Israel are keen to wrap up the most dangerous escalation between the two regional powerhouses to date. This month s dramatic escalation which kicked off with an apparent Israeli airstrike on Iran s consulate in Damascus followed by a largely foiled Iranian attack of over 300 airborne weapons on Israel seems to have given way to a rapid climbdown. Shortly after the Friday morning attack in Iran a regional intelligence source told CNN that Iran was not expected to respond further and that the direct statetostate strikes between the two enemy states were over. The latest flareup brought the stakes into sharp focus but it also exposed the limits of a direct confrontation between Iran and Israel. Remember What happens between Iran and Israel rarely stays between Iran and Israel. The region is deeply intertwined. That heightens the risks of military action but it also acts as guardrails against a potential conflagration. So when US officials said last weekend that Washington would not participate in an Israeli response to Iran s attack on Israel that seemed to immediately take the wind out of the sails of a potential escalation. The European Union has imposed sanctions on extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem the European Council announced on Friday listing four people and two entities. According to the statement the entities Lehava a radical rightwing Jewish supremacist group and Hilltop Youth a radical youth group consisting of members known for violent acts against Palestinians and their villages in the West Bank were added to the EU sanctions regime alongside two leading figures of Hilltop Youth Meir Ettinger and Elisha Yered. Neria Ben Pazi who the EUs governing body said has been accused of repeatedly attacking Palestinians and Yinon Levi who the council said has taken part in multiple violent acts against neighbouring villages were also added to the listing. The EU s top diplomat Josep Borrell said in a post on X that the EU has decided to sanction extremist settlers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem for serious human rights abuses against Palestinians. We strongly condemn extremist settler violence perpetrators must be held to account.  Belgium s Foreign Minister Hadja Lahbib said that she welcomes the sanctions adding that the recent escalation of violence against Palestinians in the West Bank must stop these settlers must be held accountable.  Yered responded later Friday saying he was honored to be included in this respected list and that we shall continue holding onto the land of our forefathers until the victory.  This post has been updated with comment from Elisha Yered. There does not appear to be any extensive damage at an air base purportedly targeted by an Israeli military strike according to exclusive satellite images obtained by CNN from Umbra Space.  The synthetic aperture radar SAR satellite images were taken around 1018 a.m. local time.  There does not appear to be any large craters in the ground and there are no apparent destroyed buildings. Additional visual satellite imagery will be needed to check for burn scars which cannot be seen by SAR images around the complex. The SAR images are created by a satellite transmitting radar beams capable of passing through clouds like the ones currently preventing satellites from imaging the area. Those radar beams bounce off objects on the ground and echo back to the satellite. Iranian news agency FARS said that an army radar at the Isfahan province military base was one of the possible targets and that the only damage from the attack was broken windows on several office buildings. The images also show that the Iranian F14 Tomcats that have been stationed at the air base in the past are not there at the moment. Additional archival satellite imagery reviewed by CNN shows that those F14 Tomcats have not been there for some time. UN SecretaryGeneral Ant nio Guterres has urged both sides to cease retaliating after Israel carried out a military strike on Iran a spokesperson said in a statement on Friday. ,
