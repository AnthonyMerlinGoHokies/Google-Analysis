https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/lisa-murkowski-says-not-vote-trump-biden-2024-rcna141551,  I could not vote for Trump Murkowski said in a phone call with NBC News on Saturday night adding I can t vote for Biden.  She urged those like her who want an alternative not to quit on former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley s longshot GOP bid yet.  I want to encourage everyone who believes that America is better than just a redo of what we have from 2020 the Alaska senator said just ahead of her state s primary on Super Tuesday and one day after she endorsed Haley. I don t want to see that white flag raised.  Pressed on why now she said simply Why not? It s not just a situation where Nikki is the lesser of the evils. She is a qualified competent capable leader at a time when the country needs them. I refuse to accept that Trump and Biden are my only two choices.  Murkowski endorsed Haley on Friday and was followed soon after by a fellow Trump critic in the upper chamber Sen. Susan Collins RMaine. Murkowski who previously admitted that she also didn t vote for Trump in 2020 voted to convict him on impeachment charges after the Jan. 6 2021 insurrection. Trump who was acquitted of those charges then backed a primary challenger who unsuccessfully ran against Murkowski in 2022. Now as Murkowski backs an opponent in Trump s race questions are emerging about the viability of Haley s candidacy given the former United Nations ambassador s inability as of yet to win a primary. If Haley were to drop out Murkowski says that she and others would be unsure of what to do in the 2024 election.  Lisa Murkowski is not the only one in this camp right now Murkowski said.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/voices/2024/03/24/trump-biden-president-not-voting-2024-election/73049943007/, Despite dozens of furious emails proclaiming that I am not a real conservative that I am some secret Democrat or encouraging me to vote Biden I have not changed my mind. However I think that one argument is worth addressing. Many people read the column and told me that every vote is valuable and my choice to not vote is throwing away my right to have my voice heard.  I understand why my willingness to discard that voting right is offputting to many. Its something I wrestled with for years as a hypothetical scenario that has become a dreadful reality. Rather than choose to vote for someone I think is entirely unfit for office I would prefer to use my vote to tell the major political parties that they have failed. I hope other conservatives join me. Our choice to vote in other 2024 races while ignoring the presidency would send a clear message that earning the White House requires a candidate worthy of it. We can still vote in state elections that matter. We criticize Democrats for voting for the WeekendAtBernie sesque candidate Biden. But we also need to have standards even if that means potentially losing an election to prove that point.  Our best course of action as a generation is to not choose the lesser of two evils but rather show the two major parties that our votes could have been won had they chosen different candidates. While I personally would be very unlikely to vote for anyone the Democrats could nominate for president much of my generation is ready to jump on board especially when the alternative is Trump. As for Republicans we should not fall victim to the lie that the fate of the country is at stake with this election. That rhetoric is helpful for rallying voters to your side but is dishonest. Our country will survive Biden s first disastrous presidency and it can survive another four years. The fate of America is not at stake in this specific election but rather in all future elections. If Americas two major political parties continue to offer disastrous candidates then America will remain in political distress. My choice to not vote for Trump or Biden is one that is rooted in concern for the future not the tales of imminent doomsday the pundits forecast.

AP PhotoChuck Burton WASHINGTON AP A small but substantial chunk of Republican primary and caucus voters say they would be so dissatisfied if Donald Trump became the party s presidential nominee that they would not vote for him in November s general election according to AP VoteCast.  An analysis of the data shows that many of those voters were unlikely to vote for Trump some even before this year but it still points to potential problems for the former president as he looks to consolidate the nomination and pivot toward an expected rematch with Democratic President Joe Biden. According to AP VoteCast surveys of the first three headtohead Republican contests 2 in 10 Iowa voters onethird of New Hampshire voters and onequarter of South Carolina voters would be so disappointed by Trump s renomination that they would refuse to vote for him in the fall.  This unwillingness to contemplate a presidential vote for Trump isn t confined to voters in the earliest states.  Lee and Bill Baltzell defected from the Republican Party to register as independents a year ago. They attended a rally for supporters of Trump s last major rival former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley last week in Centennial Colorado to encourage her to keep running against Trump.   We don t know that Trump will run into more legal problems and be disqualified and I d rather not see Biden in there for another four years said Bill Baltzell 60.  What is Super Tuesday? Why it matters and what to watch What makes Super Tuesday so super? It s all about the delegates. Here s a look at the numbers Super Tuesday highlights how presidential selection process can exclude many US voters  If it s between Biden and Trump Lee Baltzell 58 said she would consider writing in an alternative.  I don t know. I did not vote for Biden the last time I don t know that I could do it this time. But I don t know if I could vote for Trump.  Opposition from voters like the Baltzells hasn t slowed Trump s march toward the nomination but it could be an issue for him later on. It s not clear how much of a problem though because a dive into the numbers shows that many of the neverTrump voters in the early states were unlikely to vote for him in the general election to begin with. Many of the voters who said they wouldn t vote for Trump as the nominee aren t Republicans at all. In the first three headtohead contests anywhere from 17 to 31 of the voters who said they wouldn t support Trump in the general election identified as Democrats and between 14 and 27 identified as independents. Even for some of those Republicans voting for Trump was already a tough sell. Anywhere between onehalf and twothirds of the staunchly antiTrump voters in the early contests said they had voted for Biden in 2020.   Republican presidential candidate former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley speaks at a Republican campaign event in Raleigh N.C. Saturday March 2 2024. AP PhotoChuck Burton Then there is the fact that primaries tend to draw out the people with the most passionate opinions. Voter turnout in primaries and caucuses particularly ones that are relatively uncompetitive is typically lower than it would be in a general election. Still about 1 in 10 early contest voters who said they supported Trump in the 2020 general election said they wouldn t be doing so this year. One question though is whether that means they would vote for Trump s opponent instead.   Republican presidential candidate former President Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally Saturday March 2 2024 in Greensboro N.C. AP PhotoChris Carlson  I won t vote for Trump I ll just say that. I voted for him twice I could never vote for him again said Linda Binkley 74 a registered Republican who isn t pleased by the prospect of a Trump vs. Biden matchup. She added I m not sure I can vote for Biden.  If Trump becomes the nominee he will likely need to win over some of the moderates who supported Biden in 2020 if he wants to return to the White House. From that perspective even a small amount of opposition from within his own party not to mention broader skepticism among independents could be a problem in the future. AP VoteCast is a series of surveys conducted among 1597 Republican caucus voters in Iowa 1989 New Hampshire voters who took part in the Republican primary and 2466 Republican primary voters in South Carolina. The surveys were conducted by The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
