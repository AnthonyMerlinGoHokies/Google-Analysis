https://www.procon.org/headlines/sanctuary-cities-top-3-pros-and-cons/, Some argue that sanctuary cities such as San Francisco New York and Chicago should not receive federal funding because they are not enforcing federal immigration laws. Others say that sanctuary city policies protect both citizens and undocumented immigrants. There are 11 states 40 cites and 143 counties listed as sanctuary jurisdictions by the Center for Immigration Studies as of Mar. 22 2021. 32  Florida banned sanctuary cities on June 14 2019 joining at least 11 other states with similar rules according to CNN. Representatives in other states have since pushed for sanctuary cities bans including New Hampshire Georgia and Oklahoma. 22 24 25 26  Sanctuary cities grew from the Sanctuary Movement the late 1980s and early 1990s in which religious congregations began helping undocumented Salvadorian and Guatemalan families settle in the United States. They acted in direct defiance of US immigration authorities who denied over 90 of asylum requests by immigrants fleeing violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. The sanctuary activists believed that the federal government was breaking international and domestic refugee law. 1 2 Los Angeles was the first city to enact sanctuary policies with a focus on undocumented immigrants already in the United States. The chief of police enacted Special Order No. 40 on Nov. 27 1979 stating that police officers should not inquire about immigration status and should provide city services to everyone equally. San Francisco followed suit passing the City of Refuge resolution in 1985 and City of Refuge ordinance in 1989 requiring that all city employees stop immigration policing and provide city services to all residents regardless of immigration status. 2 12 29 The Trump administration held that the federal government should be able to withhold funds from sanctuary cities for their noncompliance with federal laws. The Biden administration reversed that policy. 22 27 28 3031  Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones says undocumented immigrant cooperation with police is statistically proven to make sanctuary cities safer. 15  Murder rates in San Francisco one of the oldest sanctuary cities were at their lowest in 2014 with 45 murders since the 1989 City of Refuge ordinance was enacted. 15  San Francisco s murder rate is lower than comparable nonsanctuary cities with 5.75 murders per 100000 residents in 2013 compared to 11.39 in Dallas and 15.17 in Indianapolis. 15  70 of undocumented immigrants are less likely to report being the victim of a crime and 45 of Latinos are less likely report crimes or voluntarily offer information about a crime for fear police officers would about their immigration status. The fear of being asked about immigration status also makes people less likely to cooperate with investigations. 15 16 19 The Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution provides for the separation of federal and state powers. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center the Amendment prevents the federal government from coercing state or local governments to use their resources to enforce a federal regulatory program like immigration and thus Congress cannot compel state or local governments to collect immigration status information in order to share it with the federal government. 4 7 Because the data is never collected due to don t ask don t tell policies the local and state governments are not in violation of federal law. 4  Many people believe that the federal immigration deportation policies are unjust because they target undocumented immigrants indiscriminately deport people who have lived in the United States since childhood deport people who have committed no crimes separate families and cause people to live in constant fear of deportation and its devastating consequences. 11  Libby Schaaf Mayor of Oakland California said I like to compare this to conscientious objector status. We are not going to use our resources to enforce what we believe are unjust immigration laws. 11  Juan Francisco LopezSanchez an undocumented immigrant had seven felony convictions in the United States and had been deported from the country five times. Yet the city of San Francisco declined to detain him for Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officials ICE officials and released him into the community. In July 2015 LopezSanchez was charged with murdering Katie Steinle in San Francisco. 8 9 Of 8145 undocumented immigrants released from detention requests between Jan. 1 2014 and Aug. 31 2014 5132 63 had previous criminal convictions or were marked a public safety concern 2984 36.6 had felony charges or convictions 1909 23.4 had misdemeanor convictions or charges related to violence assault sexual abuse weapons or drug distribution and 239 2.9 had three or more misdemeanor convictions. 18 8 U.S. Code 1373 states that a Federal State or local government entity or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any government entity or official from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status lawful or unlawful of any individual. 5 The Department of Justice requires that most recipients of federal grant money certify their compliance with all federal laws. Sanctuary cities by not asking about recording and submitting to the federal government the immigration statuses of residents are violating federal law and the rules for getting federal grant money. 4 6 Sanctuary policies prevent police from investigating questioning and arresting people who have broken federal immigration law. Many crimes violent and otherwise could be prevented if local law enforcement in sanctuary cities could arrest undocumented immigrants for their first crime on US soil illegal entry into the country and turn them over to federal law enforcement. 14 According to Heather Mac Donald Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute many Salvadorian gang members living in Los Angeles entered the United States illegally but because of sanctuary policies LA police officers cannot arrest the undocumented immigrants for illegal entry. Instead law enforcement has to wait for a second crime to be committed to get the criminals off the street. 14 Discussion Questions 1. How would you summarize the reasons why cities or states might decline to cooperate with the federal government on detention requests? What other solutions can you think of to address their concerns? 2. Should the federal government be allowed to withhold funding based on any reasons it decides? Why or why not? 3. Which side do you find most compelling? List three specific pieces of supporting evidence from the article or from additional research that support your view. 1.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/made-by-history/2022/09/15/red-states-send-migrants-blue-states-sanctuary-cities-are-crucial/, To many Americans sanctuary cities are a product of our fractured immigration debates of the 21st century. But sanctuary cities have a much longer history than most realize. And there is reason to believe they will persist in some form long into the future. Sanctuary cities have existed almost as long as people have built cities. Tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge God instructed Moses in the Book of Joshua 202. Ancient and medieval societies from Hawaii to India to Africa used sanctuary cities to protect soldiers from defeated armies. They sheltered people who had committed involuntary manslaughter to prevent blood feuds. In the 19th century freedom towns in the United States offered similar protections and support for African Americans fleeing slavery and racial violence. Some cities in the north refused to return escaped enslaved people in violation of the Fugitive Slave Act. In the 20th century towns in Europe harbored Jews during the Spanish Civil War and World War II. In the late 20th and early 21st century U.S. sanctuary city policies have been chiefly about welcoming immigrants whom the federal government has refused to grant humanitarian protection. The first U.S. city to offer this form of sanctuary was Los Angeles in 1979 aimed at people escaping civil wars in El Salvador and Guatemala. The United States refused to grant them asylum because it supported the brutal regimes whose extrajudicial killings disappearances and bombings of Indigenous villages they were fleeing. Although the federal government sought to deport such people Los Angeles s police department issued Special Order 40 establishing that undocumented alien status in itself was not a matter for police action in the city. By 1987 24 cities had declared themselves sanctuaries. They included big cities like New York and Chicago college towns such as Ann Arbor Mich. and Ithaca N.Y. and the suburbs of Swarthmore Pa. and Takoma Park Md. New Mexico and Wisconsin also declared themselves sanctuary states. Most copied their policies from San Francisco s 1985 City of Refuge resolution which limited police prisons and other city employees from collaborating with federal authorities in immigration enforcement. These policies also guaranteed all city residents access to municipal services like schools and health clinics regardless of their immigration status. Most of these sanctuary declarations were largely symbolic because few Central Americans lived in these places. But they were a way to publicize the 1980s Sanctuary Movement and its advocacy for changes in asylum and foreign policy especially the end of U.S.backed civil wars and genocide in Central America. And in Los Angeles and other parts of the Southwest the practical protections of sanctuary mattered for many thousands of residents from Guatemala and El Salvador. The Central American civil wars ended in the 1990s. Because of advocacy and litigation the U.S. allowed asylum seekers who had been unfairly denied status to bring new claims. Legislation allowed for temporary protected status TPS for people from some countries who had arrived before 1991. But for people who came afterward often fleeing continued violence the U.S. offered few pathways to migrate legally. As immigration from around the world grew in the 1990s and 2000s more people crossed the border illegally most from Mexico and Central America. More recently people from farther away from Venezuela to Ukraine to India have arrived at U.S. southern borders in greater numbers. Sanctuary cities became more important as immigration enforcement ramped up in the 21st century. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 played an outsize role in producing our contemporary landscape of sanctuary cities and antiimmigrant jurisdictions. The Act s 287g clause allows local police to be deputized as immigration agents and help the federal government detain and deport people. Some places became sanctuary cities in reaction to federal efforts to get local authorities to sign 287g agreements including my own city of Philadelphia which instituted a sanctuary policy in the spring of 2001. As immigration debates blew up in 2006 and again after Donald Trump s election in 2016 other cities counties and states declared themselves sanctuaries and activists launched a New Sanctuary Movement. Others by contrast passed laws seeking to restrict the residence employment and mobility of immigrants who were in the country without status although managing immigration is typically a federal matter. At the urging of lawyers with the antiimmigrant Federation for American Immigration Reform Hazleton Pa. passed the first Illegal Immigration Relief Act in 2006 aiming to punish landlords and employers of undocumented immigrants. Many places copied this law including the states of Arizona and Alabama. The Supreme Court ultimately struck down the local antiimmigrant laws but upheld key parts of the state versions. Per the U.S. Constitution it is the responsibility of the federal government alone to regulate immigration. This is why local immigration restrictions like those Hazleton attempted are unconstitutional and also why sanctuary cities can exist because the Constitution is also clear that local governments are not compelled to do the federal government s job. As our immigration system has become more restrictive with ever greater resources poured into detention and deportation under Republican and Democratic presidents the need for sanctuary has become pressing. The 1996 act also made it possible to deport people who came to the U.S. as refugees that is people who were welcomed with legal status. Cambodians resettled after the Vietnam War have been deported in large numbers since the early 2000s. Some of the people who ve been deported to Cambodia or Vietnam had never even set foot in those countries because they were born in refugee camps in Thailand or the Philippines. The U.S. has increasingly granted TPS not permanent refuge or asylum to people fleeing wars and persecution. People on TPS from Haiti Central America Africa and elsewhere live with uncertainty about how long they can stay. Sanctuary therefore matters for a wide range of people with a confusing mix of statuses. Their reasons for seeking protection include ongoing conflicts persecution of women and ethnic and religious minorities poverty environmental crises and other forces that threaten their lives and livelihoods. Like Central Americans in the 1980s many immigrants and refugees from Iraqis and Syrians to Afghanis and Somalis were displaced by wars or regimes in which the U.S. played a prominent role. Today more than 10 states and 180 cities and counties across the country have sanctuary policies. They use much the same language as the 1980s policies. Immigrant advocates have pushed for even more and during the 2020 election the BidenHarris ticket promised to eliminate 287g. But at last count some 142 local police departments especially but not only in the South had active 287g agreements. As sanctuary activists in the 1980s wrote at different times and places under varied circumstances the significance of sanctuary has been recovered and taken on new meanings. Today more people than ever are displaced from their homes around the world. As long as wealthy countries like the U.S. accept only a fraction of those seeking freedoms and legal protection the contested protections of sanctuary will continue to matter for too many of us.
https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/research/sanctuary-policies-overview, Download PDF with Citations Over the past several years an increasing number of states counties and cities have adopted a variety of policies intended to engender a greater level of trust and cooperation between local law enforcement and communities with sizeable immigrant populations regardless of immigration status. These policies include offering Englishlanguage classes issuing municipal identification documents and driver s licenses to all residents ensuring that immigrants have equal access to bail establishing UVisa policies to make it easier for victims of crime to obtain necessary documents from law enforcement agencies and training criminal prosecutors and public defenders on the immigration consequences of convictions and plea deals. One subset of these policies concerns a state s or locality s role in cooperating with federal authorities to enforce immigration law. These laws policies or resolutions are sometimes referred to as sanctuary policies although no legal or standard definition of the term exists. There are many reasons jurisdictions adopt sanctuary policies such as a desire to strengthen relations between local law enforcement and communities with large numbers of immigrants by allowing immigrants to work with police in reporting and investigating crimes without fear of retribution or potential deportation allowing state and local governments to determine how they will prioritize and allocate their resources and shielding local law enforcement agencies from liabilities resulting from local enforcement of federal immigration laws. Despite the nationwide debate there is no one clear definition of what it means for a state or local government to adopt sanctuary policies. Sanctuary policies take many forms and generally fall into the following categories The common theme behind these categories is that under a sanctuary policy state and local officials will limit their cooperation with federal immigration officials but do not actively prevent federal officials from carrying out their immigration enforcement duties. One of the most common forms of sanctuary policy is a restriction on holding immigrants in state or local jails following a detainer issued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement ICE. A detainer is an official but nonbinding request from ICE that a state or local law enforcement agency maintain custody of an individual for up to 48 hours beyond the time the individual otherwise would have been released so that ICE can arrange to take over custody. Federal actions intended to force local jurisdictions to perform immigration enforcement are likely unconstitutional. Under the Tenth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution the Federal government may neither issue directives requiring the States to address particular problems nor command the States officers or those of their political subdivisions to administer or enforce a federal regulatory program. The Supreme Court has clarified that immigration enforcement is the sole duty of the federal government and state and local police may only carry out immigration enforcement if specifically authorized to do so by the federal government. Compliance with immigration detainers is voluntary not mandatory. The federal government cannot force local jurisdictions to honor detainers an interpretation repeatedly upheld by the courts. Some state courts have also ruled that the laws of their state do not provide legal authority for law enforcement agencies to hold people on an immigration detainer. In fact jurisdictions that do honor detainers can be found liable for unlawfully holding an individual on a detainer without a judicial warrant in violation of the Fourth Amendment and may be required to compensate individuals for damages. Contrary to what many believe sanctuary policies do not conceal or shelter undocumented immigrants from detection. Nor do they shield immigrants from deportation or prosecution for criminal activities. State and local police still enforce state and local criminal laws against immigrants who are accused of committing a crime in sanctuary jurisdictions. Importantly the Supreme Court has made clear that as a general rule it is not a crime for an undocumented immigrant to remain present in the United States.  Research published in 2020 by the National Academy of Sciences found that sanctuary policies did not prevent the deportations of people with violent convictions. The research which analyzed FBI crime data and ICE deportation data found that the implementation of sanctuary policies between 2010 and 2015 did not affect crime rates in jurisdictions with such policies or result in fewer people with violent convictions being deported. Jurisdictions that adopt at least one sanctuary policy may still cooperate with federal immigration officials in a variety of other ways. For example 8 U.S.C. 1373 is a federal statute that prohibits state and local governments from enacting laws or policies that limit communication about information regarding the immigration or citizenship status of individuals with the Department of Homeland Security DHS. The statute also prohibits restrictions on maintaining such information. But a number of courts have found that Section 1373 unlawfully interferes with state and local authority. In 2017 and 2018 the Department of Justice DOJ sent letters to a number of cities and counties with sanctuary laws threatening to withhold criminal justice grants unless the jurisdictions confirmed compliance with Section 1373 which DOJ interpreted to require communication about an individual s citizenship or immigration status allow access to jails and honor immigration detainers. Numerous cities and counties sued with all but one court disagreeing with DOJ s interpretation. A 2020 study found that while sanctuary policies changed the composition of deportations reducing deportations of people with no criminal convictions by half such policies did not affect deportations of people with violent convictions. Moreover sanctuary policies also had no detectable effect on crime rates. The study concluded that sanctuary policies although effective at reducing deportations do not threaten public safety.  A 2017 report found a correlation with lower crime rates and higher economic indicators in counties that do not honor ICE detainers when compared to counties that do. The analysis revealed that in the nondetainer counties Get the latest from the American Immigration Council in your inbox. The American Immigration Council is a nonprofit nonpartisan organization.

https://cis.org/Report/Still-Subsidizing-Sanctuaries, Whistleblower Contact Whistleblower Contact Listen to the accomapanying podcast here. Jessica Vaughan is the director of policy studies and Nathan Desautels is an intern at the Center for Immigration Studies.  In 2021 the Department of Justice gave out approximately 300 million to sanctuary jurisdictions under three funding programs the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program SCAAP the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants JAG and the Community Oriented Policing Services COPS program. The awards to sanctuaries represented more than 40 percent of the available funding under these programs. Sanctuary jurisdictions are receiving this funding despite having adopted policies to hinder cooperation between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities. As a result the federal government is subsidizing agencies that may be violating federal law and undermining public safety. The Center for Immigration Studies has identified nearly 300 states and localities that have adopted sanctuary policies.1 These cities counties and states have laws ordinances regulations resolutions policies or other practices that obstruct immigration enforcement and shield criminals from ICE either by refusing to or prohibiting agencies from complying with ICE detainers imposing unreasonable conditions on detainer acceptance denying ICE access to interview incarcerated aliens or otherwise impeding communication or information exchanges between their personnel and federal immigration officers. Certain of these policies have been found to be a violation of federal law 8 USC 1373 and 1644 which says that no state or local government may prohibit or in any way restrict local officials from communicating with federal immigration authorities about a person s immigration status.2 Our analysis examines three DOJ grant programs the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program SCAAP the Edward M. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Byrne JAG and the Community Oriented Policing Services COPS. The purpose of SCAAP is to reimburse state and local prisons and jails for a portion of the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens who were held on state and local charges.3 The Byrne JAG program is the leading source of federal justice funding that goes directly to state and local jurisdictions for a range of activities including prosecution and law enforcement.4 The COPS grant program provides funding for community policing efforts in localities around the country.5 These DOJ programs are among the largest sources of federal funding for state and local law enforcement agencies. Longstanding eligibility rules require that recipients must be in compliance with all federal laws. Beginning in 2016 congressional appropriators and Justice Department officials stipulated that this included the provisions in federal law that prohibit certain sanctuary policies and took steps to block certain jurisdictions from receiving funds under these programs.6 Several jurisdictions moved to change their policies including MiamiDade County in Florida and others refused to change but were blocked from certain DOJ funding programs. A series of lawsuits ensued with varying outcomes resulting in an attempted appeal to the Supreme Court which dismissed the cases as moot7 after the incoming Biden administration rescinded the rules barring sanctuaries.8 This report examines the distribution of SCAAP Byrne JAG and COPS funding to sanctuary jurisdictions in 2021 which are presented in Table 1. The award amounts and total available funds are compiled from publicly available award announcements on the Justice Department web site.9 Nearly 300 million went to sanctuary jurisdictions in 2021 from these three federal law enforcement grants alone. This total represents a substantial level of federal grant funding going toward jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with or deliberately hinder federal immigration enforcement. Considering that nearly all of the federal immigration enforcement within the country is directed at removing aliens who have committed crimes and who are quite likely to reoffend if allowed to remain in the community the sanctuary policies undeniably are undermining public safety and undercutting the effectiveness of the DOJ programs from which they receive funding. According to one government report about 25 percent of criminal alien offenders who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions were subsequently arrested again within eight months of release.10 Sanctuary policies tend to attract illegal migration and provide a haven for illegal aliens involved in crime. Several drug dealers interviewed for a recent San Francisco Chronicle investigative story on the involvement of illegal aliens from Honduras in the city s drug trade confirmed as much telling the reporters that Honduran illegal migrants flock to the city in large part because they know that the city s sanctuary policies will help them avoid deportation The reason is because in San Francisco it s like you re here in Honduras. The law because they don t deport that s the problem. ... Many look for San Francisco because it s a sanctuary city. You go to jail and you come out. 11 Now instead of requiring awardees to demonstrate that they are in compliance with the federal law on sanctuary policies DOJ has begun requiring recipient agencies to provide information on their adherence to certain Biden administration policing policy preferences. For instance to receive a Byrne JAG grant since January 2022 law enforcement agency applicants must complete a questionnaire seeking attestations on matters such as the agencies use of force policies policies andor procedures that incorporate best practices on officer hiring recruitment and retention to include diversity equity and inclusion and efforts to address racial ethnic gender and LGBTQIA bias.12 While it may not be possible for the federal government to compel state and local governments to cooperate with federal immigration authorities it is reasonable for the federal government to try to discourage sanctuary policies and penalize jurisdictions that choose to obstruct such a legitimate and vital federal activity. The limits on a president s authority to do so have yet to be fully defined in the courts but in the meantime Congress certainly has the authority to impose conditions on federal funding programs that could block access for sanctuary jurisdictions. In addition the existence of sanctuary policies should be recognized by the federal government citizens and other stakeholders as a potential risk factor on the same level as other governance considerations for example when issuing bond credit ratings or other assessments of a state or local government s stability. Finally state governments can take action to penalize or prohibit local sanctuary policies as Texas Florida and eight other states have done. 1 Jessica M.
