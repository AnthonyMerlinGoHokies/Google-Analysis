AP Photo JERUSALEM AP Israel and Iran on Friday both played down an apparent Israeli airstrike near a major air base and nuclear site in central Iran signaling the two bitter enemies are ready to prevent their latest eruption of violence from escalating into a fullblown regional war. But the indecisive outcome of weeks of tensions which included an alleged Israeli strike that killed two Iranian generals an unprecedented Iranian missile barrage on Israel and the apparent Israeli strike early Friday in the heart of Iran did little to resolve the deeper grievances between the foes and left the door open to further fighting.  It appears we re closer than ever to a broad regional war despite the fact that the international community will most likely make a great effort to deescalate tensions wrote Amos Harel the militaryaffairs commentator for the Israeli daily Haaretz. Israel has long considered Iran to be its greatest enemy citing the Islamic Republic s calls for Israel s destruction its controversial nuclear program and its support for hostile proxies across the Middle East. These tensions have risen since Hamas and Islamic Jihad Iranianbacked Palestinian groups attacked Israel on Oct. 7 sparking a devastating Israeli offensive in Gaza that has continued for more than six months. Hezbollah an Iranianbacked proxy in Lebanon immediately began striking Israeli targets opening up titfortat fighting along a second front while Iranianbacked militias in Iraq Syria and Yemen have also fired missiles and drones at Israel throughout the war. While Israel and Iran have waged a shadow war for years mostly in neighboring Syria they have largely avoided direct confrontations. That changed after an April 1 airstrike killed two Iranian generals at an Iranian diplomatic compound in the Syrian capital of Damascus. Although Israel did not comment Iran blamed Israel for the strike and vowed revenge. Iran responded with its firstever direct attack on Israel launching over 300 missiles and attack drones late Saturday night. Israel working with a U.S.led international coalition said it intercepted 99 of the incoming fire though a handful of missiles managed to land causing minor damage to an Israeli military base and seriously wounding a young girl. In Friday s attack Iranian state television said that air defense batteries fired in several provinces over reports of drones in the air. Iranian army commander Gen. Abdolrahim Mousavi said crews targeted several flying objects.  The explosion this morning in the sky of Isfahan was related to the shooting of air defense systems at a suspicious object that did not cause any damage Mousavi said.   The Latest World leaders call on Iran and Israel to avoid allowing conflict to worsen US and UK issue new sanctions on Iran in response to Tehran s weekend attack on Israel Congress moving swiftly on bipartisan action to punish Iran after revenge attack on Israel Authorities said air defenses fired at a major air base near Isfahan which long has been home to Iran s fleet of Americanmade F14 Tomcats purchased before the 1979 Islamic Revolution.  Isfahan also is home to sites associated with Iran s nuclear program including its underground Natanz enrichment site which has been repeatedly targeted by suspected Israeli sabotage attacks. The apparent attack Friday came on Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei s 85th birthday. State television described all Iranian atomic sites in the areas as fully safe. The United Nations nuclear watchdog the International Atomic Energy Agency also said there was no damage to Iran s nuclear sites. Iranian officials made no mention of possible Israeli involvement. That could be intentional particularly after Iranian officials for days have been threatening to respond to any Israeli retaliatory attack.  Israel also had no comment on the apparent attack though one hardline government minister Itamar BenGvir hinted at his dissatisfaction with a oneword tweet early Friday using a slang word for weak or lame. But Italy s foreign minister Antonio Tajani said at a summit of Western leaders in Capri that the U.S. received lastminute information from Israel about the attack. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken did not dispute that but said We were not involved in any offensive operations.  Yoel Guzansky a former Iran expert in the Israeli prime minister s office said Israel appears to have carried out the attack to check off a box by sending a message to Iran without doing anything too provocative that could upset the United States which had urged restraint or spark further Iranian retaliation.  It seems very limited to send a message that we can strike you inside of Iran said Guzansky a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies a Tel Aviv think tank. He said the current round of violence appears to be over but that nothing has changed with Israel still facing Iranianbacked threats on various fronts.  I see further rounds he said. And the next time if Iran surprises Israel or allies don t assist in Israel s defense the outcome will be different.  U.N. SecretaryGeneral Antonio Guterres called for an end to the strikes.  It is high time to stop the dangerous cycle of retaliation in the Middle East his office said. Charles Lister a senior fellow at the Washingtonbased Middle East Institute and a longtime regional analyst challenged Iran s claims that drones carried out the attacks. It appears instead that a small number of Israeli aircraft flew from Israel over Syria striking at least two southern Syria military bases that have air defense systems along the way he said.  They then entered Iraqi airspace from where they fired a small number of Blue Sparrow airtosurface ballistic missiles likely without ever entering Iranian airspace Lister said. Accounts of explosions over Iraq support that scenario and so does debris from what appears to be the booster of an Israelimade Blue Sparrow missile that Iraqi security found in a field outside Baghdad Lister said.  In other words the Israelis would never have needed to enter Iranian airspace to conduct this attack Lister said. I think this was Israel s way of just sending a message that we can reach you anywhere we want.  If this latest round subsides Israel can now return its focus to its ongoing war in Gaza and the simmering fighting with Hezbollah. With neither of those fronts letting up the risk of further runins with Iran remains high though neither side appears eager after Friday s apparent Israeli attack.

AP PhotoVahid Salemi  Neither side is ready to jump over the brink said Alex Vatanka director of the Iran program at the Middle East Institute. But he added a major caveat.  Probably we re going to go back to the proxy war he said but now it s a proxy war with the risk of that sudden eruption of statetostate war. Which we didn t have to worry about before.

Photo Jamaal LiddellU.S. Navy Israel Conflict Spreads to 16 Nations as Biden Admin Says There s No War Iran s retaliatory strikes on Israel highlight an Americaled regional war spanning Iraq Jordan Saudi Arabia and others.   Share Copy link Share on Facebook Share on X Share on LinkedIn Share on WhatsApp  The regional war in the Middle East now involves at least 16 different countries and includes the first strikes from Iranian territory on Israel but the United States continues to insist that there is no broader war hiding the extent of American military involvement. And yet in response to Iran s drone and missile attacks Saturday the U.S. flew aircraft and launched air defense missiles from at least eight countries while Iran and its proxies fired weapons from Iraq Syria and Yemen. The news media has been complicit in its portrayal of the regional war as nonexistent. Biden Seeks to Head Off Escalation After Israel s Successful Defense the New York Times blared this morning ignoring that the conflict had already spread. Iran attacks Israel risking a fullblown regional war says The Economist. Some top U.S. officials are worried that Israel may respond hastily to Iran s unprecedented drone and missile attacks and provoke a wider regional conflict that the U.S. could get dragged into says NBC parroting the White House s deception. The Washingtonbased reporting follows repeated Biden administration statements that none of this amounts to a regional war. So far there is not a wider regional conflict Pentagon press secretary Brig. Gen. Pat Ryder said on Thursday in response to a question about Israel s strike on the Iranian Embassy. Ryder s statement followed repeated assertions by Iranian leadership that retaliation would follow and even a private message from the Iranians to the U.S. that if it helped defend Israel the U.S. would also be a viable target after which the White House reiterated its ironclad support for Israel. While the world has been focused on and the Pentagon has been stressing the comings and goings of aircraft carriers and fighter jets to serve as a deterrent against Iran the U.S. has quietly built a network of air defenses to fight its regional war. At my direction to support the defense of Israel the U.S. military moved aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to the region over the course of the past week President Joe Biden said in a statement Saturday. Thanks to these deployments and the extraordinary skill of our servicemembers we helped Israel take down nearly all of the incoming drones and missiles.  As part of that network Army longrange Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense surfacetoair missile batteries have been deployed in Iraq Kuwait the United Arab Emirates Qatar Saudi Arabia Jordan and at the secretive Site 512 base in Israel. These assets plus American aircraft based in Kuwait Jordan the UAE Qatar and Saudi Arabia are knitted together in order to communicate and cooperate with each other to provide a dome over Israel and its own regional bases. The United Kingdom is also intimately tied into the regional war network while additional countries such as Bahrain have purchased Patriot missiles to be part of the network. Despite this unambiguous regional network and even after Israel s attack on Iran s embassy in Syria earlier this month the Biden administration has consistently denied that the Hamas war has spread beyond Gaza. It is a policy stance and a deception that has held since Hamas s October 7 attack. The Middle East region is quieter than it has been in two decades Biden s national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in an illtimed remark eight days before October 7. We don t see this conflict widening as it still remains contained to Gaza deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said the day after three U.S. troops were killed by a kamikaze drone launched by an Iranbacked militia at a U.S. base in Jordan. Since then and even before this weekend the fighting has spread to Iraq Syria Jordan and Yemen. As part of the regional war network four American ships part of the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower CVN 69 battle group have played a central role in thwarting Iranbacked attacks. The ships are equipped with longrange Standard surfacetoair missiles and the Phalanx closein weapon system a Gatling gun that serves as the ship s last lines of defense against attack. All of the ships have been conducting offensive and defensive operations in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden focused on Houthi attacks they all shot Tomahawk sealaunched cruise missiles at targets in Yemen on January 12. According to maritime spotters and the Navy the destroyer USS Gravely DDG 107 has been conducting defensive and offensive operations in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden since midMarch. It has been engaging Houthi drones and missiles fired from inside Yemen toward Israel and toward maritime traffic. The destroyer USS Mason DDG 87 has also been operating in the Red Sea. Just on Tuesday it targeted a Houthi antiship ballistic missile that was targeting the U.S. commercial ship MV Yorktown according to the Navy. The destroyer USS Laboon DDG 58 arrived in the region in December and has been operating mostly in the Gulf of Aden. The guidedmissile cruiser USS Philippine Sea CG 58 arrived around Christmas and has served as the main air defense commandandcontrol hub. American ships have quietly called at ports in Oman Saudi Arabia and Djibouti the port of Duqm in Oman has been the most often visited foreign port. Lebanon is also involved in the conflict as Israel and Hezbollah have traded attacks. The White House has also said that U.S. fighter jets were involved in some of the shootdowns of Iranian missiles. Flight trackers noticed a U.S. Air Force refueling plane stationed in Qatar flying missions over Iraq during the Iranian attack. In total according to CNN around 170 drones more than 30 cruise missiles and more than 120 ballistic missiles were launched at Israel overnight Saturday. All told US forces were responsible for over 100 interceptions of Iranian drones and missiles according to Israeli officials.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/04/14/why-iran-attacked-israel/, Iranian state media said the missile and drone assault was in retaliation for a deadly Israeli strike on an Iranian diplomatic compound in Syria on April 1. Iranian media said the attack was in retaliation for an Israeli strike this month on an Iranian consular building in Damascus Syria which killed members of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps including senior commander Mohammad Reza Zahedi and Brig. Gen. Mohammad Hadi Haj Rahimi. Hamas expressed support for Iran s attack on Israel this weekend calling it a deserved response to the attack in Syria. Officials from the rebel Houthi group in Yemen congratulated Iran while downplaying their own involvement Hagari said some UAVs and cruise missiles were launched from Yemen. Israel has carried out strikes in Syria against Iran and its allies for years and throughout its sixmonth military campaign against Hamas in Gaza. But the April 1 attack stood out both because of its location in a diplomatic compound traditionally exempt from hostilities and because of the seniority of the apparent targets. Iran s supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei promised that his country would avenge the Damascus attack. U.N. Secretary General Ant nio Guterres condemned the strike citing the inviolability of diplomatic and consular premises.  Three U.S. officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss security matters said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and other senior defense officials believed Israel should have informed them ahead of time because of the strike s implications for U.S. interests in the region The Washington Post reported. U.S. officials worry about a multifront war breaking out and feared the Damascus strike could lead to attacks on U.S. military personnel based in Iraq Syria or other parts of the Middle East. U.S. military forces in the Middle East intercepted dozens of Iranian drones and missiles Austin said in a statement adding that American military forces remain postured to protect U.S. troops and support Israel s defense. He called on Iran to deescalate tensions and halt attacks on Israel.  We do not seek conflict with Iran but we will not hesitate to act to protect our forces and support the defense of Israel the statement said. Biden who had directed aircraft and ballistic missile defense destroyers to be sent to the region over the past week in anticipation of an attack said no U.S. troops or facilities were targeted in the barrage.  We will remain vigilant to all threats and will not hesitate to take all necessary action to protect our people he said. On Monday National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said that Biden communicated to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu that the weekend s defensive actions had been an extraordinary success and urged Netanyahu to think about what that success says all by itself to the rest of the region when considering next steps. Hezbollah an Iranianbacked Lebanonbased armed group has been firing rockets into Israel since the start of the war. Iran also supports Houthi rebels by smuggling weapons to Yemen allowing the Houthis to prolong a deadly campaign of violence against commercial shipping. Israel and Iran have been waging a covert war of assassinations and sabotage for years The Post has reported. More recently Iran accused Israel of killing Brig. Gen. Sayyed Razi Mousavi a senior adviser to Iran s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in a missile strike in Syria in December. Israel declined to comment on this accusation. Israel s main focus for attacks in Iran has been the country s nuclear program which Israel has tried to undermine for years The Post reported. In 2021 Iran blamed Israel for an electrical blackout at Iran s nuclear facilities and more than a decade ago when a computer virus targeted Iranian nuclear infrastructure the malware was suspected to be developed by Israel and the United States. Kareem Fahim and Suzan Haidamous contributed to this report. The IsraelGaza war has gone on for six months and tensions have spilled into the surrounding region. The war On Oct. 7 Hamas militants launched an unprecedented crossborder attack on Israel that included the taking of civilian hostages at a music festival. See photos and videos of how the deadly assault unfolded. Israel declared war on Hamas in response launching a ground invasion that fueled the biggest displacement in the region since Israel s creation in 1948. Gaza crisis In the Gaza Strip Israel has waged one of this century s most destructive wars killing tens of thousands and plunging at least half of the population into faminelike conditions. For months Israel has resisted pressure from Western allies to allow more humanitarian aid into the enclave. U.S. involvement Despite tensions between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and some U.S. politicians including President Biden the United States supports Israel with weapons funds aid packages and has vetoed or abstained from the United Nations ceasefire resolutions. History The roots of the IsraeliPalestinian conflict and mistrust are deep and complex predating the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948. Read more on the history of the Gaza Strip.

Meet your Israeli guide enjoy a time of prayer of thanks for safety and the special blessings ahead a prayer for the people of the Promised Land and a good night s rest. After breakfast we travel by private motor coach along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Caesarea where Gentiles first heard the Good News from Peter and were baptized. We ll see the Roman Amphitheatre hippodrome a film on history and the remains of this famous port city an aqueduct and then journey through the Mt. Carmel range where Elijah challenged King Ahab and the prophets of Baal. Next we travel through the Jezreel Valley to Megiddo the Armageddon battlefield where archaeologists have unearthed 20 levels of civilization. We drive through the area of Cana and Nazareth the boyhood home of Jesus where we visit the Nazareth Village a wonderful recreation of Biblical times with costumed guides. We will have dinner and overnight lodging for the next three nights along the Sea of Galilee. Day 4 Dan Caesarea Philippi Jesus Boat Sea of Galilee Boat Ride Magdala Following breakfast our morning travels take us to two valuable northern sites. Dan is where the children of Israel fell to the depths of alternative sacrifice and Caesarea Philippi the site of Peter s confession and pagan worship. We pass the possible site of the multiplication of loaves and fishes in Bethsaida and the Mount of the Beatitudes. Returning to Galilee for a St. Peter s fish lunch other selections available we then visit the ancient fisherman boat followed by a relaxing cruise on the Sea of Galilee. A brief scripture reading and devotional on board brings to life the experiences of Jesus and the fishermen disciples. We conclude our day with a visit to Magdala hometown of Mary Magdalene. The recent excavation of the first century synagogue and wellpreserved village makes Magdala one of the most interesting Biblical sites in Israel. Day 5 Capernaum Corazin Mt. Arbel Jordan River Baptism Site Today we visit the Biblical towns of Capernaum and Corazin. Capernaum is located along the Sea of Galilee and was the hometown of Peter. It is likely where Jesus and the disciples lived during much of His ministry while in Galilee. Next we visit Corazin which offers another example of a Jewish synagogue and a replica of the Seat of Moses which was carved out of the local basalt block and from which the scribes and Pharisees would have read the Torah. We enjoy a bird s eye view of the Galilee region atop Mt. Arbel. Mt. Arbel could likely be the location that Jesus would get away from the crowds to take time in prayer with His heavenly Father. Here our guide will point out the various towns listed in scripture during the time of Jesus. We conclude our day with an opportunity to be baptized at the Jordan River Baptismal Site.  Day 6 Beit Shean Bethany Beyond Jordan Abrahams Tent Mt. of Olives Garden of Gethsemane We travel southward this morning to BeitSheanScythopolis the most magnificent archeological site in Israel located at the strategic juncture of the Jezreel and Jordan valleys. Like Jericho it has been almost continuously occupied throughout history. After defeating Saul and his sons on Mt. Gilboa the Philistines hanged their bodies on the walls of BeitShean. During the time of Jesus Scythopolis was one of the chief cities of the Decapolis a league of ten cities sharing Greek culture and government. Following the fertile Jordan Valley southward your guide will point out the agricultural restoration of the Land of Milk and Honey and Israel s intricate irrigation development. We pass ancient Jericho and view from a distance this city famed as the oldest in the world. To the east of Jericho along the Jordan River Valley Queser El Yehud is the Israeli side of Bethany Beyond the Jordan. In this area Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist Elijah and Elisha crossed the Jordan and the children of Israel led by Joshua entered the Promised Land. This afternoon we will take part in the Genesis LandDinner in Abrahams Tent where we enjoy a trip back in time to relive life in the time of the Patriarchs complete with costume dramatic presentation camel ride and authentic food. Arriving in Jerusalem we ll enjoy a beautiful view of the Old City atop the Mt. of Olives and then the Garden of Gethsemane. How many have wished to be whisked back in time to get a glimpse of our Lord or hear His voice if only for a moment? To walk between the ancient olive trees read the scriptures of Jesus prayer and take time for personal reflection is important here. We will have dinner and overnight lodging for the next four nights in Jerusalem. Day 7 Masada Ein Gedi Dead Sea Scrolls Dead Sea Swim Our day begins with a cable car ride to the mountain top fortress of Masada. Here our guide will treat us to the history of the famous zealot stand. Afterwards we proceed to Ein Gedi Spring of the Goat an oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea. Because of its warm climate and abundant supply of water the site developed a reputation for its fragrant plants and date palm groves. This is where King David hid from Saul and where God defeated the enemies of the Israelites by praise and worship led by King Jehoshaphat. Next we visit the Qumran Caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. This afternoon we have an opportunity to enjoy a relaxing float in the Dead Sea. Day 8 Jesus Steps Western Walls Southern Steps Way of Suffering Garden Tomb Today we walk where Jesus walked beginning the day with a visit to the Wailing Wall and then the fascinating Rabbinical Tunnels leading us through the Second Temple era. The tunnel and exhibit give a clear understanding of the amazing construction of the Temple Mount giant stones water supply and Roman street where our Lord was led to judgment. Before exiting the tunnel we see the immense cornerstone rejected by the builders. Next we visit the Southern Wall Excavations. This southern side of The Temple was the main entrance for the common folk whereas the Priests and Levites had their own entrance from the higher eastern side. Parts of the giant stairs which led to the Temple Mount from the courtyard have been unearthed along with the purification pools. From here Jesus entered the Temple Mount and drove out the vendors and money exchangers who were exploiting the people. It is also likely that this is the place where Peter stood and preached and where thousands were saved and baptized on the Day of Pentecost. This afternoon we move on to the Judgment Hall of Pilate hear of those who conspired against Him and are reminded of His brutal beating and humiliation. From here we will also be able to see the Pool of Bethesda Stephens Gate and St. Anne s Church. While walking along the Via Dolorosa we are reminded of His way of suffering along with a visit to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Our guide will explain the differing opinions on the route where Christ was led. The actual place of crucifixion and burial is a very interesting study! The climax of the day is the area of Golgotha place of the skull and the Garden Tomb where we celebrate the resurrection with communion and a time of praise. You may choose to take an early flight home or spend the day sightseeing on your own and take a late day return flight. Those choosing to depart late in the day on Day 9 will arrive home on Day 10. Important Note Although the itinerary above obviously emphasizes the spiritual aspect of this marvelous country our guides are also experts in and passionate about the miracle of the return of the Jews and the restoration of the state of Israel.

Prepare yourself for a lifechanging experience. Get some rest on the flight tomorrow you will be walking where Jesus walked! Arrive in Israel and travel northward to our hotel for one night in the coastal area near Tel Aviv. The remainder of the day is free to walk along the Mediterranean relax and have dinner. The time is right for a personal devotional with the sunset over the Great Sea. Meet your Israeli guide enjoy a time of prayer of thanks for safety and the special blessings ahead a prayer for the people of the Promised Land and a good night s rest. After breakfast we travel by private motor coach along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Caesarea where Gentiles first heard the Good News from Peter and were baptized. We ll see the Roman Amphitheatre hippodrome a film on history and the remains of this famous port city an aqueduct and then journey through the Mt. Carmel range where Elijah challenged King Ahab and the prophets of Baal. Next we travel through the Jezreel Valley to Megiddo the Armageddon battlefield where archaeologists have unearthed 20 levels of civilization. We drive through the area of Cana and Nazareth the boyhood home of Jesus where we visit the Nazareth Village a wonderful recreation of Biblical times with costumed guides. We will have dinner and overnight lodging for the next three nights along the Sea of Galilee. Day 4 Dan Caesarea Philippi Jesus Boat Sea of Galilee Boat Ride Magdala Following breakfast our morning travels take us to two valuable northern sites. Dan is where the children of Israel fell to the depths of alternative sacrifice and Caesarea Philippi the site of Peter s confession and pagan worship. We pass the possible site of the multiplication of loaves and fishes in Bethsaida and the Mount of the Beatitudes. Returning to Galilee for a St. Peter s fish lunch other selections available we then visit the ancient fisherman boat followed by a relaxing cruise on the Sea of Galilee. A brief scripture reading and devotional on board brings to life the experiences of Jesus and the fishermen disciples. We conclude our day with a visit to Magdala hometown of Mary Magdalene. The recent excavation of the first century synagogue and wellpreserved village makes Magdala one of the most interesting Biblical sites in Israel. Day 5 Capernaum Corazin Mt. Arbel Jordan River Baptism Site Today we visit the Biblical towns of Capernaum and Corazin. Capernaum is located along the Sea of Galilee and was the hometown of Peter. It is likely where Jesus and the disciples lived during much of His ministry while in Galilee. Next we visit Corazin which offers another example of a Jewish synagogue and a replica of the Seat of Moses which was carved out of the local basalt block and from which the scribes and Pharisees would have read the Torah. We enjoy a bird s eye view of the Galilee region atop Mt. Arbel. Mt. Arbel could likely be the location that Jesus would get away from the crowds to take time in prayer with His heavenly Father. Here our guide will point out the various towns listed in scripture during the time of Jesus. We conclude our day with an opportunity to be baptized at the Jordan River Baptismal Site.  Day 6 Beit Shean Bethany Beyond Jordan Abrahams Tent Mt. of Olives Garden of Gethsemane We travel southward this morning to BeitSheanScythopolis the most magnificent archeological site in Israel located at the strategic juncture of the Jezreel and Jordan valleys. Like Jericho it has been almost continuously occupied throughout history. After defeating Saul and his sons on Mt. Gilboa the Philistines hanged their bodies on the walls of BeitShean. During the time of Jesus Scythopolis was one of the chief cities of the Decapolis a league of ten cities sharing Greek culture and government. Following the fertile Jordan Valley southward your guide will point out the agricultural restoration of the Land of Milk and Honey and Israel s intricate irrigation development. We pass ancient Jericho and view from a distance this city famed as the oldest in the world. To the east of Jericho along the Jordan River Valley Queser El Yehud is the Israeli side of Bethany Beyond the Jordan. In this area Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist Elijah and Elisha crossed the Jordan and the children of Israel led by Joshua entered the Promised Land. This afternoon we will take part in the Genesis LandDinner in Abrahams Tent where we enjoy a trip back in time to relive life in the time of the Patriarchs complete with costume dramatic presentation camel ride and authentic food. Arriving in Jerusalem we ll enjoy a beautiful view of the Old City atop the Mt. of Olives and then the Garden of Gethsemane. How many have wished to be whisked back in time to get a glimpse of our Lord or hear His voice if only for a moment? To walk between the ancient olive trees read the scriptures of Jesus prayer and take time for personal reflection is important here. We will have dinner and overnight lodging for the next four nights in Jerusalem. Day 7 Masada Ein Gedi Dead Sea Scrolls Dead Sea Swim Our day begins with a cable car ride to the mountain top fortress of Masada. Here our guide will treat us to the history of the famous zealot stand. Afterwards we proceed to Ein Gedi Spring of the Goat an oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea. Because of its warm climate and abundant supply of water the site developed a reputation for its fragrant plants and date palm groves. This is where King David hid from Saul and where God defeated the enemies of the Israelites by praise and worship led by King Jehoshaphat. Next we visit the Qumran Caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. This afternoon we have an opportunity to enjoy a relaxing float in the Dead Sea. Day 8 Jesus Steps Western Walls Southern Steps Way of Suffering Garden Tomb Today we walk where Jesus walked beginning the day with a visit to the Wailing Wall and then the fascinating Rabbinical Tunnels leading us through the Second Temple era. The tunnel and exhibit give a clear understanding of the amazing construction of the Temple Mount giant stones water supply and Roman street where our Lord was led to judgment. Before exiting the tunnel we see the immense cornerstone rejected by the builders. Next we visit the Southern Wall Excavations. This southern side of The Temple was the main entrance for the common folk whereas the Priests and Levites had their own entrance from the higher eastern side. Parts of the giant stairs which led to the Temple Mount from the courtyard have been unearthed along with the purification pools. From here Jesus entered the Temple Mount and drove out the vendors and money exchangers who were exploiting the people. It is also likely that this is the place where Peter stood and preached and where thousands were saved and baptized on the Day of Pentecost. This afternoon we move on to the Judgment Hall of Pilate hear of those who conspired against Him and are reminded of His brutal beating and humiliation. From here we will also be able to see the Pool of Bethesda Stephens Gate and St. Anne s Church. While walking along the Via Dolorosa we are reminded of His way of suffering along with a visit to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Our guide will explain the differing opinions on the route where Christ was led. The actual place of crucifixion and burial is a very interesting study! The climax of the day is the area of Golgotha place of the skull and the Garden Tomb where we celebrate the resurrection with communion and a time of praise. Day 9 Israel Museum Friends of Zion Museum Bethlehem An interesting and educational time awaits us today at the Israeli Museum. Walk through collections of century s old Israeli artifacts including the Dead Sea Scrolls and then a guided walk through an accurately detailed model of Biblical Jerusalem. This model will help put into perspective all that you have seen over the previous days touring. We then visit the Friends of Zion Museum to learn of the 19th and 20th century heroes of the Jewish people. We spend the remainder of the day surrounding the birth of Christ with a visit to Bethlehem. This evening we enjoy a special lecture by a local believer prior to dinner giving us a perspective of Messianic life in Israel. We fly to Athens and check into our hotel. You will have the remainder of the day free to relax or take a stroll along the streets of Athens to enjoy the flavor of the city. This evening our group will enjoy the first of many delectable European style dinners. We sail this morning from Athens to the quaint isle of Mykonos called the island of windmills. Experience the waterfront lined with shops and cafes and then stroll the charming walkways through a maze of whitewashed buildings before returning to the ship for dinner and evening entertainment. Docking in Turkey enjoy a tour of Ephesus the city of the Bible and one of the largest restorations still in progress with miles of ancient treasures. Ephesus was once a thriving port town of 250000 people. Today you can still see the spectacular excavations of the major streets in this ancient city including the Agora the Odeon the Library the marblepaved main Street the Baths Trajan s Fountain the Residences of the Patricians the Prytaneum and Temple of Hadrian. The Great Theatre built in the 4th century B.C. could accommodate 24000 spectators and it is famous even nowadays for its acoustics. This afternoon we visit the Isle of Patmos under statutory protection as a historic monument. Here we have a tour to see the fortified monastery of St. John and the cave claimed to be where John received the Revelation. Back on the ship enjoy the Captains dinner before settling in to your cabin for the night. Crete is the largest and the most rugged of the Greek islands. Take a tour to Heraklion and the fantastic ruins of the Palace of Knossos. Discovered in 1899 and partially reconstructed the elaborate Palace is believed to be the mythical Labyrinth of King Minos and the seat of ancient Minoan culture. This afternoon visit the island of Santorini which is perhaps the most breathtaking of all the Greek Islands. You may choose to take an optional panoramic bus tour viewing some of the most spectacular scenery of the Aegean. Travel through countless villages and settlements with delicate architecture and beauties eventually arriving in Oia. During your time in Oia visit the many narrow streets openair cafes and glittering boutiques. Upon returning to the ship we view the lacelike caldera the little islands of Thirasia Palea Nea Kameni. We arrive at the ship for dinner and evening entertainment. Day 14 Disembark Cruise Ancient Corinth Cenchreae We disembark the cruise this morning and travel west with a rest stop and photos at the Corinth Canal. Next we visit ancient Corinth the city that inspired many of Pauls most familiar letters and is a highlight for the New Testament scholar. See the Archaeological Museum the Market Place the Bema and the Temples. To enjoy a devotional in the midst of the ruins of the church of Corinth and see the pillars steps and public worship place where Paul preached will enhance your understanding and love for the Bible. The ruins of this important cultural center are fascinating as we walk along the stone path that the Apostle Paul walked. The engineering skill and intellect of these people are evident in the water systems that still flow from ancient to modern day. Our guide will be sure to show you the room dedicated to the medical care of that period. We travel on to the top of the nearby Acropolis where our guide will speak on the worship practices and point out the bird s eye view of what was a bustling city of around 800000 during Paul s stay. Another important stop is a visit to Diolkos where we view the paved trackway which enabled boats to be moved overland across the Isthmus of Corinth and served as a life line for Corinth. This shortcut allowed ancient vessels to avoid the long and dangerous circumnavigation of the Peloponnese peninsula. Before returning to Athens we will visit Cenchreae the ancient port region of Corinth. Acts 1818 states the Apostle Paul stopped at Cenchreae during his second missionary journey where he had his hair cut to fulfill a vow.  Following breakfast this morning we tour Athens the foundation of democracy. We visit the Acropolis the Parthenon and Erectheum before viewing Athens atop Mars Hill where Paul stood and preached the truth to the Gentile nation. From atop Mars Hill we view the Agora below the ancient market place and center of Athenian public life. Additional sites viewed during our panoramic bus tour are the House of Parliament the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier Olympic Stadium and Presidential Palace. An option later this afternoon is a visit to the famous Plaka with a multitude of shops and cafes. A very early morning departure for the Athens Airport for our flight homeward will allow for arrival home by early afternoon. Important Note Although the itinerary above obviously emphasizes the spiritual aspect of this marvelous country our guides are also experts in and passionate about the miracle of the return of the Jews and the restoration of the state of Israel. This fact along with many modern day topics military politics education and other cultural aspects will be woven into the commentary in order to give you well rounded information.

https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-22-24/index.html, Live Live By Kathleen Magramo Christian Edwards and Aditi Sangal CNN An independent review of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNRWA has said the agencys neutrality must be strengthened. Despite UNRWA adopting a robust framework in 2017 to address issues of neutrality the issues persist the review said. However the report did note that Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence for their allegations that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations. Israel s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oren Marmorstein criticized the report saying this is not what a genuine and thorough review looks like. This is what an effort to avoid the problem and not address it head on looks like. Israel has longstanding issues with UNRWA accusing it of aiding Hamas and calling for it to be entirely dismantled. Meanwhile the UN SecretaryGeneral Ant nio Guterres accepted recommendations made by the review which is a very important step the head of the review Catherine Colonna said. It is now up to UNRWA CommissionerGeneral Philippe Lazzarini to take this forward and to provide a clear plan on how the agency will follow up on these recommendations Colonna said adding that UNRWA plays an indispensable and irreplaceable role in the region. Lazzarini welcomed the findings and recommendations of the review. This post has been corrected to reflect that rockets were fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon  About 35 rockets fired from southern Lebanon into the area of Ein Zeitim in northern Israel were detected Monday the Israel Defense Forces IDF said. IDF forces attacked the source of the shooting it said adding that there were no casualties from the rockets fired from Lebanon.  The IDF also said it attacked terrorist targets in southern Lebanon. Hezbollah said in a statement it bombarded the command headquarters of the Third Infantry Brigade of the 91st Division in the Ein Zeitim base with tens of Katyusha rockets. Remember There have been months of crossborder fire by both Israel and Hezbollah that have displaced tens of thousands of Lebanese and Israeli residents from their homes. Israel has fired artillery and launched jets and drones to strike targets while Hezbollah has used some of its vast arsenal of rockets and missiles. This post has been corrected to reflect that rockets were fired by Hezbollah from Lebanon  The US State Department s annual report on human rights raises sharp concerns about the war between the Hamas and Israel in Gaza citing allegations of war crimes. The report which covers the year 2023 noted that human rights groups reported extensive and in many cases unprecedented conflictrelated abuses and alleged the commission of war crimes by Israel Hamas Palestinian Islamic Jihad PIJ and other Palestinian militant groups.  Those abuses include the killings torture abductions and sexual violence carried out by Hamas PIJ and others on October 7 according to the report. They also include reports of systemic torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment of Palestinian detainees in prison facilities after October 7 and the forced disappearance of thousands Palestinians from Gaza. While the report does not represent the US government s own conclusions Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in remarks Monday that we have processes within the department that are looking at that incidents that have been raised.   Those processes are ongoing he said. Its important that we take the time to do our best to get the facts to get the information to do the analysis. Its very challenging to do this in real time.  Children desperately looking for food hold empty plates and saucepans in the streets and raw sewage spills in between rows of tents. These are among the memories Melanie Ward has of Rafah in southern Gaza where more than 1 million people have been forced to flee Israel s bombardment according to the United Nations.  Every morning you wake up to the sound of gunfire from battleships off the coast Ward the CEO for the relief group Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP told CNN by phone on Wednesday. You literally never know if something is about to hit you.  Displaced Palestinians who have been uprooted from their homes and packed into the tiny area of land fear they will have nowhere to escape to ahead of an anticipated bloody Israeli ground offensive said Ward who visited Rafah earlier this month.  A UN expert warned on Monday that the psychological terror of Israel s offensive in Gaza could manifest years from now in the form of increased mental health illnesses among Palestinians there.  Ward told CNN that Gazans are completely exhausted by more than six months of persistent bombardment displacement and siege.  Melanie Ward still remembers the terrified mother in AlAqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir alBalah who begged her to expose the plight of Palestinians trying to survive Israel s bombardment in Gaza.  How do you tell a mother of a child in hospital that the problem isnt that the world doesnt know whats being done to them? Its that the world has no will to stop it Ward the CEO for the relief group Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP told CNN by phone on Wednesday.  Scores of displaced patients and their relatives covered the grounds of AlAqsa hospital said Ward who visited the medical facility in central Gaza earlier this month.  Ward described scenes of injured children screaming in pain and overwhelmed doctors struggling to prevent infections among wounded patients.  Israel s severe aid restrictions have drained water and medical supplies Ward added.  Local staff displaced by Israel s military offensive are facing the grief of relatives killed by bombardment while others shelter in homes that have been partially destroyed by Israeli missiles Ward told CNN.  Those in the north are struggling to find food she said.  Everybody is traumatized and terrified Ward added. Palestinian colleagues are just trying to survive like everybody else... They re terrified about the future for their children. How do you recover from this?  The European Union s foreign ministers have agreed to expand existing sanctions on Iran s drone and missile program the bloc s top diplomat Josep Borrell said Monday. Borrell said the new sanctions enlarge the geographical area of this framework to cover drone and missile deliveries not only to Russia but also Irans proxies in the region. The sanctions will broaden the list of components blocked from being exported from the EU that are used in the production of drones and missiles. The EU s decision comes after Iran s recent unprecedented attack on Israel which came after a suspected Israeli attack on an Iranian diplomatic complex in Syria earlier this month. The US last week announced new sanctions on 16 people and two entities associated with Iran s drone program. An independent review of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNRWA has said the agencys neutrality must be strengthened. Earlier this year Israel accused at least 12 UNRWA staffers of being involved in Hamas October 7 terror attacks and has alleged that about 12 of the agencys 13000 staffers are members of Hamas or other Palestinian militant groups. The review which was led by former French Foreign Minister Catherine Colonna and published Monday was not tasked with addressing Israels allegations but had a broader mandate to assess whether UNRWA is doing everything within its power to ensure neutrality. Despite UNRWA adopting a robust framework in 2017 to address issues of neutrality the issues persist the review said. However the report did note that Israel has yet to provide supporting evidence for their allegations that a significant number of UNRWA employees are members of terrorist organizations. They include instances of staff publicly expressing political views hostcountry textbooks with problematic content being used in some UNRWA schools and politicized staff unions making threats against UNRWA management and causing operational disruptions it said. Israels response The Colonna report ignores the severity of the problem and offers cosmetic solutions that do not deal with the enormous scope of Hamas infiltration of UNRWA Israel s Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Oren Marmorstein alleged in a statement adding this is not what a genuine and thorough review looks like. This is what an effort to avoid the problem and not address it head on looks like. Israel has longstanding issues with UNRWA accusing it of aiding Hamas and calling for it to be entirely dismantled. This post has been updated with additional statements from the independent review. Efforts to reach two hospitals in northern Gaza over the weekend were only partly successful because of delays at checkpoints and ongoing fighting according to Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus DirectorGeneral of the World Health Organization. As a result he said fuel and medical supplies did not reach Kamal Adwan for the second time in the last 7 days and partners were also unable to assess needs at AlAwda to support restoration of services. This is further increasing the health risks of critical patients being treated there.  The mission was nonetheless able to evacuate four critically sick patients from Kamal Adwan along with their caretakers including one at possible risk of having a leg amputated he said.

If you want to experience the history of Israel and see the Bible come to life our Holy Land tours give you that opportunity. The city of Jerusalem offers a unique convergence of Judaism Christianity and the Muslim faith. For Christians who visit Jerusalem you will learn about many stories of the Bible while walking her streets. Many actors in the Bible such as Abraham King David King Solomon the twelve disciples and Jesus all lived visited or spent time there. The Passion week of Christ will be highlighted during our stay as we visit the Mount of Olives the Garden of Gethsemane the Western Wall the Way of Suffering and the Garden Tomb. Nowhere in Israel does the Bible come to life more than along the shores of the Sea of Galilee. Pilgrims who visit the Galilee region have the opportunity to imagine what life was like 2000 years ago and what Jesus and the twelve disciples experienced while fishing on the Sea of Galilee. The peaceful setting and the natural wonders of the Golan Heights to the east and Mt. Arbel to the west make for a great way to start your morning in quiet reflection. During our tour we explore the Biblical towns of Capernaum Magdala and Nazareth and take a meaningful cruise on the Sea of Galilee. The Dead Sea is not only the lowest and most lifeless lake in the world but also nearly 10 times saltier than the ocean. Travelers will enjoy the beautiful colors of the blue water and the red mountains of Jordan to the east. Take time to enjoy a onceinalifetime Dead Sea float either in the sea itself or at one of the warm salt water pools at our hotel. The Dead Sea experience is truly a bucket list visit you won t want to miss! Our visit to the Garden Tomb and its surrounding gardens is normally one of the highlights of our tour to Israel. The Garden Tomb is a rockcut tomb in Jerusalem that was unearthed in 1867 and is considered by some Protestants to be the site of the burial and resurrection of Jesus. Our visit offers a unique time of prayer reflection communion and praise which will be a special lifelong memory for many travelers. The Jordan River Baptist Site or Yardenit is a baptism site located along the Jordan River just south of the Sea of Galilee in northern Israel. This site is frequented by Christian Pilgrims who enjoy imagining the setting of the baptism of Jesus. For anyone who would like to be baptized in the Jordan River Yardenit has been developed to be a peaceful setting with beautiful gardens clean colored water changing facilities showers and a nice souvenir shop. To many Pilgrim travelers Caesarea Philippi is a special surprise while on their tour. Located along the rushing springs of Mt. Hermon the beautiful and natural setting is where Jesus asked his disciples Who do men say that I am? He asked this question while observing the pagan worship of the god Pan as worshipers offered their sacrifice at the Gates of Hell. Our time at Caesarea Philippi is one of many opportunities throughout our tour to see the lessons and message of the Bible come to light in a special way.

Our tour guide was great as his depth of knowledge of the people history and languages Israel was quite amazing. We will very likely use Pilgrim again in the future. We have toured with Pilgrim Tours three times and what a blessing. Accommodations excursions information and food were all high quality. Post pandemic we were so thankful to return to Israel. I couldnt have asked for more for a trip to the Holy Land than what Pilgrim Tours provided me. It was the perfect balance of spiritual reverence history geography and social issues. I am so grateful for the experience that I had on this trip. Our church group just returned from taking a Best of Israel ten day tour. It was one of the best experiences of my life. I am so glad we chose Pilgrim tours. From our excellent hotel accommodations to our wonderful tour guide we enjoyed everything. Our trip exceeded our expectations. I would recommend Pilgrim Tours to anyone who is planning a trip to the Holy Land. We definitely plan to travel with them again. View some of the sites from our Israel tours!

https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/03/21/majority-in-u-s-say-israel-has-valid-reasons-for-fighting-fewer-say-the-same-about-hamas/, The remaining 2051 respondents are members of three other survey panels Ipsos KnowledgePanel SSRS s Opinion Panel and NORC at the University of Chicago s AmeriSpeak Panel who were interviewed because they identify as Jewish or Muslim. We oversampled i.e. interviewed a disproportionately large number of Jews and Muslims to provide more reliable estimates of their views on the topics covered in this survey. But these groups are not overrepresented in the national estimates reported here because we adjusted for the oversampling in the weighting of the data. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education religious affiliation and other categories. In total 1941 Jewish and 414 Muslim respondents participated in this survey. While the sample design was identical for Jews and Muslims the resulting sample sizes are different. There are two main reasons for this. The Jewish population in the United States is roughly double the size of the Muslim population. Consequently national survey panels have roughly twice as many or more Jewish panelists as Muslim ones. In addition decades of research on survey nonresponse has shown that some groups in the U.S. are more likely to participate in surveys than others. Generally speaking Jewish adults are more likely to participate in surveys than Muslim adults. The survey also included questions about where people were born and whether people identify as Arab or of Arab origin. Because of insufficient sample size we are unable to analyze Arab Americans or Americans of Israeli or Palestinian descent separately. In this survey Jews and Muslims are defined as U.S. adults who answer a question about their current religion by saying they are Jewish or Muslim respectively. Unlike our 2020 report on Jews in America this report does not separately analyze the views of Jews of no religion i.e. people who identify as Jewish culturally ethnically or by family background but not by religion. For more information on how we conducted this survey refer to the ATP s Methodology and the Methodology for this report. Read the questions used in this report along with responses. Months into the IsraelHamas war roughly sixinten Americans 58 say Israel s reasons for fighting Hamas are valid. But how Israel is carrying out its response to Hamas Oct. 7 attack receives a more mixed evaluation. About fourinten U.S. adults 38 say Israel s conduct of the war has been acceptable and 34 say it has been unacceptable. The remaining 26 are unsure. Only around oneinfive Americans 22 think the way the Israeli government is carrying out the war against Hamas will make the Israeli people more secure than they were before the war. The rest think the war will make Israelis less secure 27 not have much effect 15 or say they are unsure 35. When asked about Hamas reasons for fighting Israel far fewer Americans 22 describe them as valid. And just 5 of U.S. adults say the way Hamas carried out its Oct. 7 attack on Israel was acceptable while 66 describe it as completely unacceptable. Also few Americans 10 think Hamas actions will make the creation of an independent Palestinian state more likely than it was before the war. Around a third of the U.S. public thinks it will make an independent state less likely 32 while 15 say it will not have much effect and 41 are unsure.  Some questions in this survey ask Americans for opinions on how Israel and Hamas have been fighting. Other questions ask for opinions on why each side has been fighting. After pretesting the questions here is the exact wording we settled on This issue is challenging for many people both emotionally and in terms of understanding the specifics of the war. Many Americans are also disengaged Relatively few 22 say they are closely following news about the war and half can correctly report that more Palestinians than Israelis have died since the war s start. On many questions about the war sizable numbers express no opinion. These and other results come from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 1325 among 12693 adults. Unlike most polling in the United States since the war began this survey includes enough Jewish and Muslim respondents to allow their views to be analyzed separately. When it comes to how Jews and Muslims feel about why and how the two sides are fighting we find In the U.S. 62 of Jews and 53 of Muslims report that hearing or reading news about the IsraelHamas war makes them afraid. In other religious and nonreligious groups the share expressing fear is lower. Jews are also more likely than other U.S. religious groups to say news about the conflict makes them feel angry. American Jews and Muslims are also paying more attention to the war than other groups analyzed with 61 of Jews and 41 of Muslims saying they re following it extremely or very closely. Pew Research Center surveys conducted on our American Trends Panel ATP always include Jews and Muslims. But these surveys do not always have enough Jewish or Muslim respondents to report their answers separately. This is because they make up relatively small shares of the U.S. adult population Roughly 2 of Americans say their religion is Judaism and 1 say their religion is Islam. To provide more reliable estimates of Jewish and Muslim views on the topics covered in this survey we included Jewish and Muslim respondents from three other national panels run by large research organizations Ipsos NORC and SSRS. All these panels are probability based meaning they use random sampling methods to recruit respondents. They are not optin polls. In total 1941 Jewish and 414 Muslim respondents participated in this survey. In this report Jews and Muslims are defined as U.S. adults who answer a question about their current religion by saying they are Jewish or Muslim respectively. Unlike our 2020 report on Jews in America this report does not analyze the views of Jews of no religion i.e. people who identify as Jewish culturally ethnically or by family background but not by religion. While the sample design was identical for Jews and Muslims the resulting sample sizes are different. There are two main reasons for this. The Jewish population in the U.S. is roughly double the size of the Muslim population. Consequently national survey panels have roughly twice as many or more Jewish panelists as Muslim ones. In addition decades of research on survey nonresponse has shown that some groups in the U.S. are more likely to participate in surveys than others. Generally speaking Jewish adults are more likely to participate in surveys than Muslim adults. There are also stark differences across age groups in views of the war. For example Age differences also are evident in many other issues related to the war which are explored in other chapters of this report. Some key findings include Related How Americans view the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine Israel and Hamas and China and Taiwan Few Americans say they sympathize entirely with either the Israeli people 11 or the Palestinian people 5. Rather 57 sympathize at least to some extent with both Israelis and Palestinians including 26 who say their sympathies lie equally with both groups. A much smaller share of U.S. adults 8 say they do not sympathize with either group while 18 are unsure. To the degree that Americans sympathize more with one group than the other 31 say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Israeli people. This is about twice as many as say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people 16. By a margin of more than 21 adults under 30 sympathize relatively more with Palestinians than with Israelis 33 vs. 14 while the balance of opinion is reversed among older age groups. Much of this is related to young Democrats and Democratic leaners 47 of whom sympathize either mostly or entirely with Palestinians. Young Republicans and GOP leaners on the other hand are slightly more likely to sympathize either entirely or mostly with Israel 28 or with both sides equally 24 than entirely or mostly with Palestinians 12. Substantial shares of both young Democrats 19 and young Republicans 24 say they are unsure where their sympathies lie. Americans tend to express much more favorable views of the people on both sides of the IsraelHamas war than of the leadership on either side the Israeli government the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. For example 64 of U.S. adults say they have a favorable view of the Israeli people compared with 41 who express a favorable view of the Israeli government. The same is true of views of the Palestinian people 50 favorable compared with either the Palestinian Authority which controls the West Bank 23 favorable and especially relative to Hamas which has controlled Gaza in recent years 8 favorable. Indeed sixinten Americans express very unfavorable views of Hamas. Views of the Israeli government have become more negative since 2022. Today 41 of U.S. adults express a favorable view of the Israeli government down from 47. The share who express very unfavorable views of the government also has nearly doubled over this time period from 12 to 21. We do not have data on how views of the Palestinian Authority or Hamas have changed over time. Among adults under 30 the share expressing a favorable view of the Israeli people has fallen 17 percentage points since 2019 while their views of the Palestinian people have not shifted over this timespan. Older people s views of both Israelis and Palestinians have remained largely unchanged. How to describe the current war both for the respondents taking the survey and when writing up the results is not a choice we made lightly.  First we consulted The Associated Press Stylebook a resource we often follow. According to the AP Stylebook The Associated Press is calling the present conflict between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas a war Do not use terms such as IsraelPalestinian war or Gaza war.  Second we consulted with outside experts who recommended we avoid terminology suggesting that Israeli forces are fighting only in Gaza when in reality they are also active on other fronts including against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Third we conducted pretests with 17 respondents and asked them Do you have thoughts on using the phrase IsraelGaza war instead of IsraelHamas war ? While around half did not have an opinion among those who did several felt IsraelHamas war was more accurate. For example one respondent said It should be the IsraelHamas war because it s not a Gaza thing it s Hamas versus Israel. They started it. Another noted I don t agree with saying IsraelGaza war. It s IsraelHamas. That s who they are going after. Still two respondents said the opposite. One said It s more IsraelGaza than IsraelHamas because it s not really Jews against Palestinians so we should focus on a country and that region. Another said Gaza sounds bigger than the Hamas part does. All 17 respondents said the questions we asked seemed neutral rather than appearing to favor a particular side in the ongoing war. After completing the survey the 12693 respondents who took it were also asked whether they found the survey to be politically neutral and 92 did including large majorities of Muslims and Jews. Americans are divided about how and whether the U.S. should be involved in the IsraelHamas war. Democrats and Democraticleaning independents differ sharply from Republicans and Republicanleaning independents in their attitudes toward U.S. involvement in the war. Democrats are much more supportive than Republicans of providing humanitarian aid in Gaza 66 vs. 35 and of the U.S. playing a major diplomatic role in resolving the war 25 vs. 16. Indeed Republicans are twice as likely to say the U.S. should play no role 32 as they are to say the U.S. should play a major role 16 in solving the conflict 37 support the U.S. playing a minor role. However Republicans are twice as likely as Democrats to favor providing military aid to Israel to help in its war against Hamas 50 vs. 25. U.S. public opinion is deeply divided and to a large extent uncertain about whether President Joe Biden is striking the right balance in his approach to the war 21 favoring the Israelis too much 22 or favoring the Palestinians too much 16. The largest single slice of the public 40 is not sure how well Biden is handling the issue. While these views are broadly similar to what we found in a December 2023 Pew Research Center survey opinion among those under 30 has shifted. In the February survey 36 of those ages 18 to 29 say Biden is favoring Israel too much up from 27 just a few months ago. Explore this further in Chapter 2. American Jews stand out for the relatively high share who say Biden is striking the right balance 45. Only around a quarter or fewer in most other religious groups say the same including just 6 of U.S. Muslims. Muslims are among the U.S. religious groups that are most inclined to say Biden favors the Israelis too much 60. Among other religious and nonreligious groups atheists 52 and agnostics 43 are especially likely to express this view. One of the few opinions a solid majority of Americans can agree on when it comes to the IsraelHamas war is that lasting peace is unlikely. Only 3 say it is either extremely or very likely while 9 say it s somewhat likely. Fully 68 say a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians is either not too or not at all likely. Opinion is somewhat more mixed when it comes to the best possible outcome of the conflict. A plurality 40 says the best outcome would be a twostate solution splitting the land into two countries one with an Israeli government and one with a Palestinian government. But many Americans remain unsure of the best outcome 30 and some prefer a model in which all the land is one country with an Israeli government 14 or one country that is jointly governed by Israelis and Palestinians 13. Few prefer the land to be one country with a Palestinian government 2. Jewish Americans 46 and Muslim Americans 41 also tend to think a twostate solution is the best possible outcome but about oneinfive people in each group support a onestate option. Among Jews 22 would prefer for all the land to be one country with an Israeli government. Among Muslims 20 would like all the land to be under a Palestinian government. Overall Americans support for a twostate solution has increased modestly since 2022 from 35 to 40. Much of the shift has come among Democrats and Democraticleaning independents. Today 48 of Democrats favor a twostate solution up from 36 in 2022. Indeed this shift has opened up a partisan gap in views of the twostate solution that was not present in 2022. Among Republicans the twostate solution is endorsed by 33 while 26 think the best outcome would be for a single country with an Israeli government to control all the land.

For He is gentle and lowly of heart and you will find great peace and joy for your soul . Our lifechanging journey begins this evening as we board our overnight flight to Jordan. We arrive in the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan and transfer to our lodging for the evening in Amman. Day 3 Machaerus Bethany on the Jordan Dead Sea Traveling southward we stop at a Dead Sea resort for a relaxing float or optional spa treatment. Our next stop today will be at the hilltop palacefortress of Machaerus where John the Baptist was beheaded. Next we visit the fascinating site of Bethany on the Jordan the place where Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist where Elijah and Elisha crossed the Jordan as well as the area where the children of Israel led by Joshua entered the Promised Land. We return to Amman for dinner and overnight. This morning we travel to Jerash one of the best preserved and most complete provincial Roman cities. Jerash Gerasa of Roman Times was one of the cities of the Decapolis a confederation of 10 GraecoRoman cities dating from the 1st century BC situated in Jordan Syria and Israel. Known as the Pompeii of the East for its extraordinary state of preservation the ruins indicate human occupations at this location for more than 2500 years. From here we continue on to our lodging for the evening in Petra. This morning we visit the amazing mountain fortress of Petra known to be inhabited by the Edomites the descendants of Esau. Begin the tour with a walk through the Siq an immense crack in the Nabatean sandstone to the city of Petra carved out of the rose red rock. The Treasury El Khazneh is one of the most elegant remains of antiquity. Beyond El Khazneh we are surrounded on both sides by hundreds of Petras carved and built structures. Departing Petra we travel northward on the Kings Highway where to the west we view the hills bordering the Dead Sea. This is the area of the hilltop palacefortress of Machaerus where John the Baptist was beheaded. We overnight in Amman this evening. Our morning tour begins in the town of Madaba the biblical Medeba 30 kilometers south of Amman. Madaba is best known for its Byzantine and Umayyad mosaics and at the Greek Orthodox Church of St. George we view the earliest surviving mosaic map of the Holy land. Mt. Nebo believed to be the site of the tomb of Moses commands a spectacular view across the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea. Study the panorama as we read the scripture of God showing Moses the Promised Land before He brought him home to heaven. As we travel west toward the Allenby Bridge we view to the north the Plains of Moab the area where the tribes of Israel camped before crossing the Jordan and picture the place where Jesus was baptized. Crossing the Jordan River into Israel we drive to Tel Aviv area with the remainder of the afternoon free. You may wish to take a devotional time with the sunset over the Great Sea a time of prayer and thanks for the special blessings ahead a prayer for the people of this land and then enjoy a good night s rest. After breakfast we travel by private motor coach along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea to Caesarea where Gentiles first heard the Good News from Peter and were baptized. We ll see the Roman Amphitheatre hippodrome a film on history and the remains of this famous port city an aqueduct and then journey through the Mt. Carmel range where Elijah challenged King Ahab and the prophets of Baal. Next we travel through the Jezreel Valley to Megiddo the Armageddon battlefield where archaeologists have unearthed 20 levels of civilization. We drive through the area of Cana and Nazareth the boyhood home of Jesus where we visit the Nazareth Village a wonderful recreation of Biblical times with costumed guides. We will have dinner and overnight lodging for the next three nights along the Sea of Galilee. Day 8 Dan Caesarea Philippi Jesus Boat Sea of Galilee Boat Ride Magdala Following breakfast our morning travels take us to two valuable northern sites. Dan is where the children of Israel fell to the depths of alternative sacrifice and Caesarea Philippi the site of Peter s confession and pagan worship. We pass the possible site of the multiplication of loaves and fishes in Bethsaida and the Mount of the Beatitudes. Returning to Galilee for a St. Peter s fish lunch other selections available we then visit the ancient fisherman boat followed by a relaxing cruise on the Sea of Galilee. A brief scripture reading and devotional on board brings to life the experiences of Jesus and the fishermen disciples. We conclude our day with a visit to Magdala hometown of Mary Magdalene. The recent excavation of the first century synagogue and wellpreserved village makes Magdala one of the most interesting Biblical sites in Israel. Day 9 Capernaum Corazin Mt. Arbel Jordan River Baptism Site Today we visit the Biblical towns of Capernaum and Corazin. Capernaum is located along the Sea of Galilee and was the hometown of Peter. It is likely where Jesus and the disciples lived during much of His ministry while in Galilee. Next we visit Corazin which offers another example of a Jewish synagogue and a replica of the Seat of Moses which was carved out of the local basalt block and from which the scribes and Pharisees would have read the Torah. We enjoy a bird s eye view of the Galilee region atop Mt. Arbel. Mt. Arbel could likely be the location that Jesus would get away from the crowds to take time in prayer with His heavenly Father. Here our guide will point out the various towns listed in scripture during the time of Jesus. We conclude our day with an opportunity to be baptized at the Jordan River Baptismal Site.  Day 10 Beit Shean Bethany Beyond Jordan Abrahams Tent Mt. of Olives Garden of Gethsemane We travel southward this morning to BeitSheanScythopolis the most magnificent archeological site in Israel located at the strategic juncture of the Jezreel and Jordan valleys. Like Jericho it has been almost continuously occupied throughout history. After defeating Saul and his sons on Mt. Gilboa the Philistines hanged their bodies on the walls of BeitShean. During the time of Jesus Scythopolis was one of the chief cities of the Decapolis a league of ten cities sharing Greek culture and government. Following the fertile Jordan Valley southward your guide will point out the agricultural restoration of the Land of Milk and Honey and Israel s intricate irrigation development. We pass ancient Jericho and view from a distance this city famed as the oldest in the world. To the east of Jericho along the Jordan River Valley Queser El Yehud is the Israeli side of Bethany Beyond the Jordan. In this area Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist Elijah and Elisha crossed the Jordan and the children of Israel led by Joshua entered the Promised Land. This afternoon we will take part in the Genesis LandDinner in Abrahams Tent where we enjoy a trip back in time to relive life in the time of the Patriarchs complete with costume dramatic presentation camel ride and authentic food. Arriving in Jerusalem we ll enjoy a beautiful view of the Old City atop the Mt. of Olives and then the Garden of Gethsemane. How many have wished to be whisked back in time to get a glimpse of our Lord or hear His voice if only for a moment? To walk between the ancient olive trees read the scriptures of Jesus prayer and take time for personal reflection is important here. We will have dinner and overnight lodging for the next four nights in Jerusalem. Day 11 Masada Ein Gedi Dead Sea Scrolls Dead Sea Swim Our day begins with a cable car ride to the mountain top fortress of Masada. Here our guide will treat us to the history of the famous zealot stand. Afterwards we proceed to Ein Gedi Spring of the Goat an oasis on the western shore of the Dead Sea. Because of its warm climate and abundant supply of water the site developed a reputation for its fragrant plants and date palm groves. This is where King David hid from Saul and where God defeated the enemies of the Israelites by praise and worship led by King Jehoshaphat. Next we visit the Qumran Caves where the Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered. This afternoon we have an opportunity to enjoy a relaxing float in the Dead Sea. Day 12 Jesus Steps Western Walls Southern Steps Way of Suffering Garden Tomb Today we walk where Jesus walked beginning the day with a visit to the Wailing Wall and then the fascinating Rabbinical Tunnels leading us through the Second Temple era. The tunnel and exhibit give a clear understanding of the amazing construction of the Temple Mount giant stones water supply and Roman street where our Lord was led to judgment. Before exiting the tunnel we see the immense cornerstone rejected by the builders. Next we visit the Southern Wall Excavations. This southern side of The Temple was the main entrance for the common folk whereas the Priests and Levites had their own entrance from the higher eastern side. Parts of the giant stairs which led to the Temple Mount from the courtyard have been unearthed along with the purification pools. From here Jesus entered the Temple Mount and drove out the vendors and money exchangers who were exploiting the people. It is also likely that this is the place where Peter stood and preached and where thousands were saved and baptized on the Day of Pentecost. This afternoon we move on to the Judgment Hall of Pilate hear of those who conspired against Him and are reminded of His brutal beating and humiliation. From here we will also be able to see the Pool of Bethesda Stephens Gate and St. Anne s Church. While walking along the Via Dolorosa we are reminded of His way of suffering along with a visit to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher. Our guide will explain the differing opinions on the route where Christ was led. The actual place of crucifixion and burial is a very interesting study! The climax of the day is the area of Golgotha place of the skull and the Garden Tomb where we celebrate the resurrection with communion and a time of praise. Day 13 Israel Museum Friends of Zion Museum Bethlehem An interesting and educational time awaits us today at the Israeli Museum. Walk through collections of century s old Israeli artifacts including the Dead Sea Scrolls and then a guided walk through an accurately detailed model of Biblical Jerusalem. This model will help put into perspective all that you have seen over the previous days touring. We then visit the Friends of Zion Museum to learn of the 19th and 20th century heroes of the Jewish people. We spend the remainder of the day surrounding the birth of Christ with a visit to Bethlehem. This evening we enjoy a special lecture by a local believer prior to dinner giving us a perspective of Messianic life in Israel. A very early morning departure for the Tel Aviv Airport for our flight homeward will allow for arrival home by early afternoon. Important Note Although the itinerary above obviously emphasizes the spiritual aspect of this marvelous country our guides are also experts in and passionate about the miracle of the return of the Jews and the restoration of the state of Israel. This fact along with many modern day topics military politics education and other cultural aspects will be woven into the commentary in order to give you well rounded information.

https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/3/16/play-in-israel-just-dont-pretend-you-didnt-know, Since October 7 scores of writers have authored scores of columns pleading to no avail with prominent politicians who wield transformative power to stop the genocide unfolding with such obscene lethality in the apocalyptic remnants of occupied Gaza. The same dynamic applies to a gallery of preening artists who claim that they are not only allergic to conformity but also reject as tantamount to censorship any call from any quarter not to entertain audiences in Israel. Rather than beseeching Nick Cave the Australian troubadour or the British band Radiohead finally to heed the petitions of Brian Eno Roger Waters and company and forgo performing in an apartheid state my aim here is to challenge their by now discredited defences to opt to play in Tel Aviv. After not performing in Israel for some 20 years in 2014 Cave refrained from signing on to an artistorganised pledge meant to show tangible solidarity with imprisoned Palestinians to boycott touring in Israel in the aftermath of yet another Israeli killing spree in Gaza. Cave later explained his decision this way There was something that stunk to me about that list. Then it kind of occurred to me that I m not signing the list but I m also not playing Israel and that just felt to me cowardly really.  The lobbying Cave added constituted a public humiliation that apparently fuelled his determination to spurn the overture and stage shows in Israel.  It suddenly became very important to make a stand against those people that are trying to shut down musicians to bully musicians to censor musicians and to silence musicians so really you could say in a way that the BDS made me play Israel Cave said referring to the Boycott Divestment Sanctions movement. In this flattering construct Cave is the portrait of the principled renegade resisting the ageold rejectionist forces bent on muzzling him and by extension his art. In a 2017 letter to his hero Brian Eno the British musical savant behind the boycott drive Cave insisted that he was not a supporter of the Israeli government to blame for the injustices suffered by the Palestinian population . And yet like the Israeli government he distances himself from Cave recycled the stock canard to discredit the BDS movement by claiming that the boycott of Israel can be seen as antiSemitic at heart . Cave suggested that Eno should instead adopt a more salutary approach by travelling to Israel to share his scorn for the current regime with the press and the Israeli people then do a concert on the understanding that the purpose of your music was to speak to the Israeli people s better angels . Cave s admonition is grounded on a false premise that the atrocities endured by generations of Palestinians are the sole responsibility of a succession of Israeli regimes and not the millions of Israelis who empowered and emboldened those regimes by exercising their democratic franchise time and again. Cave lauded Israel as a real vibrant and functioning democracy but absolved ordinary Israelis of the atrocities committed by the governments they elect. Cave s jejune reasoning reached an embarrassing zenith in the following sentence that confuses naivete for wisdom.  How far must we have strayed from the transformative nature of music to feel justified in weaponising music and using it to punish ordinary Israeli citizens for the actions of their government.  Thom Yorke the lead singer for Radiohead has rehashed nearverbatim this rationale in rebuffing filmmaker Ken Loach who implored the popular band not to go to Israel in 2017 given its encyclopaedic record of egregious human rights violations.  Playing in a country isn t the same as endorsing its government Yorke responded. We don t endorse Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu any more than Trump but we still play in America.  Yorke s rejection of BDS has the patina of gravitas that Cave s smear lacks.  Music art and academia he wrote is about crossing borders not building them about open minds not closed ones about shared humanity dialogue and freedom of expression.  Yorke s pretty soliloquy oozes saccharine. Gaza has been reduced to ruins by deliberate design. The Israeli architects of that ruin do not give a hoot about crossing borders opening minds shared humanity dialogue and freedom of expression. Prime Minister Netanyahu and his septic cabinet are razing Gaza and the occupied West Bank with the explicit consent approval and encouragement of most Israelis. Polls consistently show that the vast majority of ordinary Israelis back every malignant aspect of a genocide meant to erase Gaza. The carpet bombing. The blanket destruction of homes hospitals mosques churches schools and universities. The forced marches. The blockade of food water fuel and medicine a sinister blueprint to starve Palestinians into submission and capitulation. The better angels Cave urged Eno to speak to through music have like the bulk of Israel been consumed by an unquenchable killing rage that burns like a towering bonfire. Cave and Yorke have compounded their blindness with hypocrisy that reveals a defining insincerity. In 2022 Cave was challenged by a fan to square his vocal unabashed solidarity with Ukrainians with his glaring failure to do the same for brutalised and suffering Palestinians.  This saddens me the fan wrote for this puts you on sic a position of a double standard.  Cave s reply was a pretentious lump of rhetorical flimflam brimming with the standard evasions about how a brutal unprovoked attack differs from a deeply complex clash of two nations that is far from straightforward . Cave wrote that he sympathises deeply with the tragic fate of all innocents and reminded his interlocutor that he has helped raise money for schools in Palestinian communities .  But this is not the time for these debates Cave averred. This is the time to unite in unequivocal support and love for the Ukrainian people. Right now a catastrophe is unfolding and I stand with all Ukrainians at this horrific moment in history.  Yorke parroted Cave s condescension scolding BDS supporters for engaging in the kind of dialogue that s black and white.  There is nothing complex about the genocide being perpetrated with ruthless relentless efficiency by an occupying army that has killed more than 30000 innocents and maimed and traumatised countless others with the hearty blessing of much of a grateful nation. I suspect that the schools Cave championed are like the 13000 dead Palestinian infants and children gone shattered into bits. So play in Israel again if you re inclined Mr Cave and Mr Yorke. Just don t pretend not to know who was complicit in this other horrific moment in history and that you chose to sing to them.
