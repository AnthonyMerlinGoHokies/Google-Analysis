https://time.com/6660478/gun-control-america-public-health/, When President Biden called for action after last October s mass shooting in Maine he did so by once again casting gun violence as an epidemic a Hippocratic term taken from the study of the spread of infectious diseases.  The notion that guns cause a public health crisis best addressed through harm reduction strategies like background checks red flag laws or safe storage guidelines courses through the language of experts doctors activists and media commentators.  That language reflects gains made by gun safety researchers like me. Our work promotes wellbeing within the armed petri dish that is America a nation with more guns than people and more mass shootings than calendar days. A health framework makes profound tactile sense guns present unacceptable threats to American mortality and the numbers only worsen. Faced with such trends public health experts and physicians mobilize to try to save lives in the same ways we once did when excess mortality resulted from cigarettes faulty seatbelts or asbestos insulation. But a limitation to our approach becomes increasingly significant in the leadup to the 2024 election guns represent different kinds of pathogens than did cigarettes or cars. The ideologies driving expansive gun rights aspire not just to sell specific products but to gain power and wield influence in increasingly undemocratic ways. And a heath framework that emphasizes threats to human bodies offers little counter to threats to the American body politic as a result. Background checks and red flag laws for instance offer little counter when expressly progun judges and courts overturn firearm safety laws put in place by voters in places like New York Maryland and Oregon. Gun politics bleed into realms of governance when progun donors politicians and judges shape widening swaths of U.S. domestic and foreign policy about matters ranging from women s reproductive choice to voting rights to free speech. Guns also fan America s deepest social divides when armed militias storm state capitals or intimidate voters at polling stations. Or when gun sellers play on fears and conspiracies about safety to foment white anxiety about Black violence and looting while at the same time marketing semiautomatic weapons to Black and Latino populations using concerns about police brutality. These instances and others highlight how guns represent more than health problems they are problems of race of history of plurality. As columnist Jamelle Bouie puts it gun politics present a challenge to the very possibility of an open democratic society.  Guns in other words are not just threats to public health they are threats as historian Ruth BenGhiat writes to the strong civic culture and a public sphere conducive to social trust and altruism that healthy democracies require.  These dangers promise to grow even more intense should Donald Trump who once called himself the most progun president in history and now ominously touts himself as the NRA s loyal friend win in 2024. All of which highlights I have come to believe the need for a broader approach Democrats need to tie gun safety to the defense of the American public square. I am a physician sociologist gun policy scholar and a longtime advocate for gun safety. Our interventions save lives. Yet I ve spent the past five years interviewing gun owners and gunshot victims across the U.S. South for a new book What We ve Become that tells the story of the 2018 Nashville Waffle House mass shooting. My research showed me time and again how while the health frame can be effective on clinical and moral levels it is less so at political ones. For instance the Nashville shooting like so many others appeared to support the need for stronger gun laws. The shooter would have almost certainly been stopped by a red flag law before he killed anyone had one been in effect instead he was easily able to buy and carry firearms.  But no such legislation passed in Tennessee in the months after the shooting. Instead of making GOP politicians pay for their inaction at the polls the opposite scenario played out. In the gubernatorial election held months after the tragedy Tennessee voters elected GOP businessman Bill Lee who ran on a platform that championed eliminating most restrictions on gun owners and eliminating most permits and regulations governing public carry. Lee became arguably the most progun governor in state history. Publichealth backed candidates for Governor and other state offices lost because health arguments failed to contest what journalist Patrick Blanchfield calls gunpower power accrued and wielded under the mantra of gun rights to build reliable voting blocks and donor bases elect loyal politicians and seat sympathetic judges.  I also came to appreciate how violence prevention efforts that emphasized government regulations could be problematic for many conservative gun owners the very people who would be most impacted should these regulations become laws.  A wide range of Southern gun owners even ones who told me that they supported gun safety voiced alarm about policies that required their personal identification entered into government databases or expanded police authority through civil restraining orders.  In their view the government threatened individual autonomy. As a man who lived on a farm in Tennessee and owned multiple AR15 s put it to me people out here come to terms with the idea that the government isn t going to save you from violence. Each individual is their own most effective first responder.  Another red state gun owner contended that Southern conservatives remained skeptical of regulation because the majority of violent gun crime is committed in places with the strictest control on guns in other words in this fraught formulation in dense urban blue cities by persons of color. These largely predictable responses pointed me toward a core challenge facing public health a widening gap between what guns do and what they mean.  Publichealth based approaches developed methods for reducing the nearly fifty thousand American gun deaths per year an unconscionable number.  But a framework focused on injuries and deaths had relatively less to say about the social effects of the roughly 500 million guns bought and carried by more people in evermore locales across the U.S. The vast majority of guns carried in parks bars airports busses and other public settings were not involved in shootings or crimes. I saw time and again how the space between seeing guns as health risks and as viable tools of American public life was eagerly filled by selfinterested parties like gun manufacturers and the NRA who framed gun ownership as a trapping of white male identity through themes of protection against liberals and racial others superiority and liberty.  During the pandemic in particular gun sellers played on fears about police violence and public health overreach to sell guns to new groups of owners. By 2020 gun sales soared headlines announced amid pandemic social unrest election fears. Black and Latino Americans and leftists socialists progressives rushed to buy guns after the police murder of George Floyd.  Guns and not governments increasingly became the autonomic American responses to feelings of uncertainty.  On a practical level vast increases in public guns made it nearly impossible for safety experts like me to pick the mass shooters of the world out from the millions of people who own and carry firearms to no effect. And at the level of ideology buying guns during moments of peril bolstered a neoliberal belief long undergirding gun rights arguments that your safety is your responsibility because the state won t protect you.  All of which rendered a central tenet of the publichealth approach to gun safety seem increasingly illogical to many gun owners the notion that equitable regulations and prevention policies yield trust among people as if by herd immunity. There are stirrings that new forms of activism might break though the roadblocks to reform long put in place by the NRA. Candidates backed by the grassroots group Moms Demand Action performed well in 2023 elections. Parkland survivor David Hogg heads a new organization that helps young progressive lawmakers get elected to state legislatures and the U.S. Congress. The appalling GOP response to the Covenant School shooting mobilizes a new wave of reformminded candidates in Tennessee. These initiatives are exceedingly important. In our winnertakeall political system winning is a requisite step for change. Winning lets you seat judges allocate resources and enforce regulations. Winning lets you strengthen democratic institutions.  But my research suggests that victory will remain elusive if the aim of political power is to enact more of the same gun laws without attending to the larger contexts and structural drivers of violence unsafety and democratic decline.  I ve come to believe that in the current moment when democracy itself is at stake gun safety needs to improve people s lives in ways that they can see and feel strengthen the concrete undergirding civil society and allow blue and red state Americans to imagine broader coalitions based on shared interests rather than on shared anxieties.  In the long run gun laws by themselves will have relatively little effect in changing the contours of the American gun debate if they don t go handinhand with material investments that take seriously people s safety concerns and reward community cohesion over armed tribalism.  Thankfully a growing body of research combines the insights of public health with methods from urban planning economics business criminology and sociology to show how gun laws have the greatest effect if joined with investments in lived environment. Fixing streetlights creating parks and green space jobs programs and rebuilding civic infrastructure public safety and community resiliency can reduce gun crime at rates that supersede those produced by gun laws alone.  While these types of interventions have been tested in blue cities they are rarely attempted in rural parts of red states like Tennessee. People in these parts of the country often confront public health most visibly in moments of crisis such as after mass shootings or during pandemics when they are told to wear masks get vaccines or regulate gun sales. Public health can connote restricting freedoms or being forced to comply with mandates but rarely represents prosperity in ways that are evident in the everyday. That needs to change. Public health researchers and gun safety advocates could work together across RedBlue divides to partner with builders employers developers Internet providers supermarkets transit experts and city planners to redefine and construct safe neighborhoods. They could align with local and national businesses to promote ways that gun safety can be progrowth such as working with AI developers to reimagine safe parks workplaces or schools. They could host grantwriting workshops and reward communities to improve public safety using reinforcement algorithms developed by health insurers. Reformers could create economic benchmarks to aid mayors and governors based on the work of sociologist Patrick Sharkey showing how investments in place reduce violent crime and enable formerly distressed neighborhoods to prosper.  These kinds of interventions take at face value the core assumption of many guncarry arguments that public spaces should be safe for everyone and intervene upstream to do so. Few of these interventions involve trying to mandate individuallevel behaviors but instead aim to engage broader categories of shareholders to build what political theorists call strategy influence by creating longterm sustainable relationships that provide practical benefits. Deeper attention to financial structures can also counter critiques that public health fails to pay enough attention to economic factors in its interventions. Again it s a travesty that America does not have comprehensive national guns laws. But interventions long proposed by scholars like me are imperfect in large part due to the narrow terrain on which we ve been allowed to even research gun safety let alone put the policies we propose into practice. Years of funding bans and outright resistance have left us promoting modest interventions to an overwhelmingly complex national scourge. As we fight for adoption of even the most basic laws it s important to keep in mind that guns are issues into themselves and they are also symbols material objects and lethal enforcers in a much larger fight about America about who we are and who we will become. Leading up to the 2024 election and beyond we are ultimately better off by combining biomedical expertise with sustained investment in structures that build and reinforce common knowledge common cause and common sense.

https://www.denverpost.com/2024/04/22/colorado-legislature-gun-reform-bills-democrats/, Fresh off a historic vote to advance a ban on many highpowered semiautomatic guns the Colorado House approved three more gunrelated bills over the weekend sending them across the Capitol for another round of debate. Those votes on Saturday were followed Monday by the state Senate s final approval for two other gun reform bills dealing with concealedcarry permits and firearms storage in vehicles. The House s Saturday votes on bills concerning gun dealer licensing insurance requirements for gun owners and taxes on sales of guns and ammunition relied on support only from Democrats though varying numbers of the majority caucus opposed each bill joining Republicans. The party splits were similar for Monday s votes in the Senate.  The legislature s Democrats this year have embraced gun control and reform measures as they seek to reduce gun violence advancing a slate of bills that would add new restrictions while also seeking to better enforce existing laws. Their Republican colleagues have blasted the legislative package as potentially violating the Second Amendment and their allies have promised swift legal challenges should many of the bills ever become law. Democratic House leadership on Friday limited initial debate on each measure to between 90 minutes and two hours an increasingly common tactic used to head off Republican filibustering for contentious debates. While the highestprofile measure the ban on assault weapons awaits a Senate committee hearing here is where the other newly advanced bills stand During debate of the licensure bill House Republicans who uniformly opposed it accused Democrats of focusing on lawabiding gun dealers. The measure fits into other legislation being pursued by Democrats this year. That includes a bill to direct more money to the Colorado Bureau of Investigations to monitor illegal gun sales and other potentially unlawful activity. The licenses required under the bill would also be in jeopardy under the proposed assault weapons ban if gun dealers violate its provisions and if the ban becomes law.

New gun safety laws are taking effect in a handful of states in this new year. While the country ended 2023 with more mass shootings than days in the year new laws in California Colorado Illinois Michigan Minnesota and Washington are aimed at preventing gun violence. Adam Winkler is a constitutional law professor at UCLA and an expert in gun policy. Adam Winkler UCLA School of Law Thanks so much for having me. So in this new year several states have implemented new gun policies. Give us a sense of the categories of restrictions and what they aim to do. Well we have a host of new gun laws that have gone into effect with this new year. Some states like California have adopted new restrictions on who can carry concealed weapons and where those guns can be carried. States like Washington have expanded background checks and imposed a waiting period while still other states like Michigan and Minnesota have enacted red flag laws which allow judges to temporarily remove firearms from someone whos deemed a threat to themselves or to others. According to the Gun Violence Archive there were more than 650 mass shootings in the U.S. in 2023. Those are incidents where more than four people are shot or killed. What effect could some of these gun laws have on preventing gun violence of that sort? Well mass shootings are of course one of the hardest problems in the gun safety world to solve. But nonetheless some of the laws that have been adopted are targeting these mass shootings. For instance Washington state has expanded gun background checks in an effort to try to keep guns out of the hands of people who will commit mass shootings. A waiting period can also potentially help prevent a mass shooting to the extent that its a crime of passion that one does without much thought and consideration. Still other states like Illinois have banned the weapons that are most commonly used in highprofile mass shootings those militarystyle assault rifles with highcapacity magazines. Many of the states that we have mentioned are Democraticled states. What are Republicanled states doing in the way of passing new gun safety laws if at all? In recent years we have seen red states make their gun laws more permissive and more loose. So for instance we have seen several states adopt what they call permitless concealedcarry regimes. That is you can carry a concealed firearm even if you dont have a permit. Many of these new gun restrictions are already being challenged in the courts. How do you expect that to play out? Well its very difficult to know exactly how all of these gun laws are going to fare in court. One thing is clear. The Supreme Court has in recent years greatly expanded Second Amendment protections and virtually any gun law is likely to be challenged in court. And many of those challenges will be successful. The Supreme Court has said that for gun laws to be constitutionally permissible they have to resemble the gun laws of the 1700s and 1800s. Given how different our gun laws are today from the 1700s and 1800s many gun laws that are innovative and trying to solve todays problems are likely to run aground when they get into court. Are laws and policy enough to address this countrys problem with gun violence? What more needs to be done do you think? Politicians are one thing but the truth is we have over 400 million guns in America and any new policy we adopt runs headlong into that simple fact. We are a heavily armed society. And as long as we are heavily armed theres going to be firearm fatalities theres likely going to be mass shootings and theres going to be the easy availability of firearms for those who wish to try to commit suicide. So we can reduce gun violence but we cant expect to eliminate the gun violence problem in America. Adam Winkler thanks so much for your insights. We appreciate it.

https://www.mprnews.org/story/2024/03/21/another-round-of-gun-law-changes-again-in-the-mix-at-the-capitol, But another possible change penalizing buyers who purchase guns for people ineligible to have them could be coming with broader party backing. That s in part due to a case unfolding out of a highprofile Burnsville shooting. The gun bills are still in play after getting hearings ahead of a legislative deadline this week. But that doesn t mean they re all on track for passage. None of the three can afford to stumble in the Senate s public safety committee Friday as it could jeopardize their path forward.

Gun control advocacy groups rallied at the Minnesota Capitol on March 5 in support of additional restrictions on firearm possession.Dana Ferguson MPR NewsThe safe storage and reporting bills would require Democrats to stick together to overcome expected opposition from Republicans. Meanwhile the Republicanbacked straw purchasing bill could be stalled out by Democrats who have said the proposal needs work. Both gun control advocates and gun rights groups have been a fixture at the Capitol as these measures have come forward. Those favoring more restrictive laws gathered for a rally recently. They said Democrats made strides last year in passing laws that require additional background checks to obtain a firearm and set up a petition process to remove guns from people at risk. But they and allied lawmakers said their work wasn t done. Stewart Naaden of Oak Grove shows off his Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus pin at the State Capitol in St. Paul on Tuesday.Ben Hovland MPR News The idea that we can do nothing about this is absurd it is unacceptable. And our kids are living with the consequences of that attitude Rep. Dave Pinto DFLSt. Paul told the group on the Capitol steps. We re going to keep on pushing together to make sure that we keep our community safe and that we protect Minnesota.  In hearings this session gun violence survivors and family members shared the toll that gunrelated deaths have taken. Hilary Brasel said the restrictions could have prevented the fatal shooting of her husband Michael Brasel just last year.  It literally was 57 seconds that took the criminals to drive up to our home break into my car and interact with my husband shoot him three times and speed away Brasel said. But the crime will have a lifetime of consequences our lives will never be the same.  GOP lawmakers have said lawmakers should also move quickly this year to address the fatal shooting of first responders in Burnsville last month. They ve urged heightened penalties for straw purchasers those who buy or provide a gun to someone unauthorized to have it. In both chambers Republicans have tried without success to suspend the rules to bring bills up for a vote that would boost the penalty from a gross misdemeanor to a felony.  A version came up for a committee hearing Thursday and another was slotted for a Senate panel discussion Friday. GOP lawmakers voiced concerns about additions that would require additional reporting to the Legislature on firearms seized and gun trafficking investigations underway. It would also lump in additional devices attached to a firearm allowing it to fire off more bullets at once.  If we obviously agree on the increasing penalties for straw purchasers piece I don t know why we couldn t just have a clean bill that affects that rather than attaching a potentially controversial gun control piece of legislation to it as well Rep. Water Hudson RAlbertville said. Sen. Heather Gustafson DFLVadnais Heights is carrying her own version and said it will likely begin a discussion this year.  There s some room to be working on that. But again that takes time to get it right Gustafson said. I don t want to I don t want to rush something as important as the straw purchase legislation.  Before passing new laws Republicans and gun rights advocates say prosecutors should enforce laws already on the books that set penalties for those who unsafely store their firearms or transfer them to people unauthorized to have them.  We re law abiding we obey the law Greg Kemple of Rochester said. And we feel that it s an unjust crucifixion every year when the Legislature gets in session. They immediately come out of the gate like they did this year and started throwing all these gun laws at us.  Kemple and a few dozen others filled out bright yellow postcards and walked through how to talk about each of the proposals before meeting with lawmakers on Wednesday morning.  With hours left before lawmakers were set to hit a first committee hearing deadline on Friday gun owners held out hope that they could stave off more changes.   I think that if anything does pass this year said Rob Doar of the Minnesota Gun Owners Caucus I think it s going to be something significantly more measured than what was introduced.

This final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act s expansion of firearm background checks the only significant expansion of the background check requirement since thenSenator Biden helped shepherd the Brady Bill over the finish line in 1993. This action is part of the BidenHarris Administration s strategy to stem the flow of illegally acquired firearms into our communities and hold accountable those who supply the firearms used in crime. Statement from the President I ve spent hours with families who ve lost loved ones to gun violence. They all have the same message Do something. Today my Administration is taking action to make sure fewer guns are sold without background checks. This is going to keep guns out of the hands of domestic abusers and felons. And my Administration is going to continue to do everything we possibly can to save lives. Congress needs to finish the job and pass universal background checks legislation now.  Statement from the Vice President Every year thousands of unlicensed gun dealers sell tens of thousands of guns without a background check including to buyers who would have failed one domestic abusers violent felons and even children. This single gap in our federal background check system has caused unimaginable pain and suffering. Today as the head of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention I am proud to say that all gun dealers must conduct background checks no matter where or how they sell.  The federal gun background check system is one of the best tools we have to keep guns out of the hands of individuals prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms including domestic abusers and other violent criminals. But the loopholes in America s background check laws have enabled domestic abusers school shooters violent criminals and gun traffickers to illegally acquire firearms. Over the past 20 years there have been numerous failed efforts to close these loopholes and expand background checks including a bipartisan attempt in 1999 that followed the shooting at Columbine High School and another bipartisan attempt in 2013 that followed the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School. In 2022 President Biden accomplished what many had tried for the past 20 years he succeeded in expanding background checks by signing into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. This law broadened the category of gun sellers required to become licensed dealers and run background checks. In 2023 President Biden signed an Executive Order to accelerate implementation of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act including by directing the Attorney General to move the U.S. as close to universal background checks as possible without additional legislation by clarifying the new Act. The Department of Justice s DOJ final rule clarifies the type of conduct that requires a person to get a license to sell guns and to conduct background checks. By setting clear standards for when someone is dealing firearms the rule provides the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF with proactive tools to enforce the law and keep our communities safe. Background Check Loopholes Have Deadly Consequences Since 1994 federal law has required federally licensed firearms dealers to run background checks prior to selling or transferring a weapon. These background checks have helped keep guns out of the hands of more than three million individuals who are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. Despite the law a growing number of unlicensed sellers continue to sell firearms for profit to complete strangers they meet at gun shows and online marketplaces which has been a critical gap in the background check laws. For the past 30 years individuals who could not pass a background check sought out unlicensed sellers in order to evade the background check system. One investigation found that 1 in 9 people who respond to online ads from unlicensed sellers would fail a background check. Tragic consequences of this unlawful conduct include Unlicensed dealers who do not conduct background checks are also the largest source of firearms that are illegally trafficked into our communities. In an assessment of its gun trafficking investigations from 2017 to 2021 ATF identified sales by unlicensed dealers as the most frequently used gun trafficking channel. Moreover unlicensed dealers were the source of more than half of the firearms identified as having been trafficked during the fiveyear study period a total of more than 68000 illegally trafficked firearms. Final Rule Implements New Law Expanding Background Check Requirement to Tens of Thousands of Gun Sales The Department of Justice s final rule implements the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act the largest expansion of background checks since the Brady Bill became law. The final rule makes clear when a person needs to become a licensed dealer and run background checks and gives the Department of Justice additional tools to crack down on individuals illegally selling guns without background checks. Specifically the final rule There are over 80000 licensed gun dealers in America. The Department of Justice estimates that there are over 20000 unlicensed sellers who are selling firearms through online advertisements gun shows and other means. These unlicensed sellers should be licensed under the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and the new rule and therefore conducting background checks. An alternative estimate based on survey data estimates that the new rule could affect gun sales being made by over 80000 individuals. Legal limitations on tracking firearms make such estimates difficult to quantify. Final Rule Builds on the BidenHarris Administration s Commitment to Stopping the Illegal Flow of Guns The BidenHarris Administration has deployed a historic effort to partner with state and local law enforcement and keep communities safe by addressing the illegal sources of guns. The strategy is focused not just on the person who pulled the trigger of a firearm but also on all of the links in the chain that led to the firearm being in the wrong hands including the gun trafficker the source of the gun trafficker s firearms rogue gun dealers who are willfully violating the law and ghost gun manufacturers. Key Administration actions to stop the illegal flow of guns into our communities include Today the BidenHarris Administration is moving as close as possible to universal background checks without additional legislation. President Biden and Vice President Harris continue to call on Congress to enact universal background checks and finish the job. The President and Vice President also continue to call on Congress to increase funding for the ATF so the agency can continue its lifesaving work to stop the flow of illegal firearms into our communities. The President requested 2 billion for ATF as part of his FY 25 budget request. Opt in to send and receive text messages from President Biden.

Keeping students safe from gun violence in their school communities is a top priority for the BidenHarris Administration. According to the Washington Post there have been 394 school shootings that exposed more than 360000 students to gun violence since the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The BidenHarris Administration is committed to preventing gun violence. President Biden and Vice President Harris worked to enact the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act BSCA the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. Following this the President created the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention which is being overseen by Vice President Harris. The unprecedented Office is accelerating the implementation of BSCA identifying new executive actions partnering with state and local officials and coordinating the first ever federal interagency response to mass shootings and concentrations of community violence. The President has also taken more executive actions on preventing gun violence than any other President. The BidenAdministration has invested more resources in school safety and taken significant steps to keeps firearms out of school. The strategy has focused on 1 stopping people in crisis and juveniles from accessing firearms 2 implementing evidencebased schoolbased preventative solutions and 3 addressing the mental health needs of students particularly those impacted by gun violence. During her visit to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida the Vice President is announcing two solutions to keep guns out of the hands of people in crisis First Vice President Harris is announcing the launch of the firstever National Extreme Risk Protection Order ERPO Resource Center which will support the effective implementation of state red flag laws. Second the Vice President is calling on states to pass red flag laws and to use BSCA funding to help implement laws already enacted. Extreme Risk Protection Order or Red Flag Laws Can Prevent Shootings The Department of Homeland Security s National Threat Assessment Center conducted a systematic review of targeted school violence incidents and found that there were often warning signs. The review which is corroborated by other analysis found that these incidents were often preceded by observed warning signs including instances where the individual told other about their plan ahead of time. ERPO or red flag laws generally create a civil process for law enforcement and often times family members to seek a judicial order that a person is a danger to themselves or others and should temporarily lose the ability to purchase and possess firearms. The laws have due process protections that ensure people s rights are respected but also enable a concrete way to intervene. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School occurred after there were clear warning signs but there were no tools to remove the shooter s firearm. The survivors of the shooting advocated for passage of a red flag law in Florida and the tragedy helped to inspire the passage of red flag laws in other states across the country. Currently 21 states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws on the books. These laws have been shown to prevent mass shootings and suicides but the tools made available under these laws are only effective if people are aware of them and can properly invoke them. Additional BidenHarris Administration Actions to Keep Schools Safe Addressing Access to Firearms by People in Crisis or Under 21 The National Threat Assessment Center found that 76 percent of incidents of targeted school shootings are committed with guns from the home. There are approximately 4.6 million children living in homes with unsecured firearms so the BidenHarris Administration has prioritized raising awareness about how safe gun storage can keep schools and young people safe. For example U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona sent a letter and template to school principals across the country explaining the importance of safe storage and encouraging them to communicate with parents families caregivers and the broader community about how safe storage can protect students in school and in their communities. The DOJ released a comprehensive guide to safe storage of firearms in order to provide subject matter expertise on different types of storage devices and best practices for safely storing firearms. This is the most comprehensive guide on safe storage ever released by the federal government. In addition DOJ s Byrne State Crisis Intervention Program made grant funds available for law enforcement to acquire gun locks and storage devices that can be distributed to individuals and businesses. The BidenHarris Administration has quickly implemented BSCA to enhance background check for individuals under 21 who seek to purchase a firearm at a licensed gun dealer. Federal law has longprohibited firearms dealers from selling handguns to persons under 21 . The BSCA requires enhanced background checks before any sale or transfer of a firearm to a person under the age of 21. Since implementing BSCA s enhanced background checks in October 2022 DOJ has conducted enhanced background checks on more than 230000 transactions. Those checks have kept more than 2300 firearms out of the hands of dangerous and prohibited persons and over a quarter of those denials 667 as of this month were based solely on information received through the additional BSCAenabled outreach. Just a few of the transactions denied under the new background check illustrate how important this new tool is working Lastly untraceable ghost guns that could be ordered online and easily completed at home were starting to show up in school shootings. The BidenHarris Administration cracked down on ghost guns by making clear that businesses manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns including buybuildshoot kits must comply with federal firearm laws requiring background checks a federal license and inclusion of serial numbers. Largest Dedicated Effort on EvidenceBased SchoolBased Solutions The BidenHarris Administration provided 1 billion to schools through the Stronger Connections Grant program which helps provide students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success and overall wellbeing. Stronger Connections funding is allocated to underserved school districts including those that have a high rate of community or school violence on a competitive basis and may be used for a variety of strategies including schoolbased mental health services safety and violence prevention and intervention programs and physical security measures.  Over the past 3 years the BidenHarris Administration has awarded nearly 500 million for schools to invest in evidencebased solutions through the STOP School Violence Program with funding supplemented by BSCA. The program is designed to improve K12 school security by providing schools students and teachers with the tools they need to recognize respond quickly to and help prevent acts of violence and ensure a positive school climate. This includes developing and operating anonymous reporting systems and training school personnel on preventing school violence. The DOJ anticipates approximately 160 million in additional funding opportunities for the STOP program this year. The Biden Harris Administration has established the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse pursuant to the Luke and Alex School Safety Act that was part of BSCA. The Clearinghouse located at SchoolSafety.gov provides evidencebased practices and recommendations to improve school safety for use by states local educational agencies institutions of higher education state and local law enforcement agencies health professionals and the general public. Historic Investment in Student Mental Health The BidenHarris Administration awarded 122 billion in American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to help schools reopen and recover and experts indicate more than 2 billion has been directed to hire more school psychologists counselors and other mental health professionals in K12 schools. With the help of these funds the number of school social workers school counselors school nurses and school psychologists have all increased over prepandemic levels. The BidenHarris Administration will invest more than 1 billion to help underserved school districts hire and train schoolbased mental health professionals over the next five years. To date the U.S. Department of Education ED has awarded 571 million across 264 grantees in 48 states and the District of Columbia to boost the training hiring and diversity of mental health professionals in schools. The funding was made available through BSCA and grantees estimate that these funds will collectively support the training and hiring of more than 14000 new mental health professionals to serve America s school children. ED anticipates making approximately 38 million of new funding available for new applicants his year. The BidenHarris Administration will continue to take action to ensure that our schools and our communities are safe from gun violence. At the same time President Biden and Vice President Harris call on Congress to pass universal background checks a national red flag law an assault weapons ban and a secure storage law to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act PLCAA which gives gun dealers and manufactures special immunity from certain liability for their products and to increase appropriations to support youth mental health and violence prevention strategies.
