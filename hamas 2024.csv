AP PhotoNasser Nasser RAFAH Gaza Strip AP Israeli strikes on the southern Gaza city of Rafah overnight killed 22 people including 18 children health officials said Sunday as the United States was on track to approve billions of dollars of additional military aid to Israel its close ally. Israel has carried out neardaily air raids on Rafah where more than half of Gaza s population of 2.3 million has sought refuge from fighting elsewhere. It has also vowed to expand its ground offensive against the Hamas militant group to the city on the border with Egypt despite calls for restraint including from the U.S.  In the coming days we will increase the political and military pressure on Hamas because this is the only way to bring back our hostages and achieve victory. We will land more and painful blows on Hamas soon Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. He didn t give details. The first Israeli strike in Rafah killed a man his wife and their 3yearold child according to the nearby Kuwaiti Hospital which received the bodies. The woman was pregnant and the doctors saved the baby the hospital said. The second strike killed 17 children and two women from an extended family.

Mohammed alBeheiri said that his daughter Rasha and her six children the youngest 18 months old were among those killed. A woman and three children were still under the rubble. The IsraelHamas war has killed more than 34000 Palestinians according to local health officials at least twothirds of them children and women. It has devastated Gaza s two largest cities and left a swath of destruction. Around 80 of the territory s population have fled to other parts of the besieged coastal enclave. The 26 billion aid package approved by the U.S. House of Representatives on Saturday includes around 9 billion in humanitarian assistance for Gaza which experts say is on the brink of famine. The U.S. Senate could pass the package as soon as Tuesday and President Joe Biden has promised to sign it immediately. The conflict now in its seventh month has sparked regional unrest pitting Israel and the U.S. against Iran and allied militant groups across the Middle East. Israel and Iran traded fire directly this month raising fears of allout war. Tensions have also spiked in the Israelioccupied West Bank. Israeli troops killed two Palestinians who the military says attacked a checkpoint with a knife and a gun near the southern West Bank town of Hebron early Sunday. The Palestinian Health Ministry said that the two killed were 18 and 19 from the same family. No Israeli forces were wounded the army said. Later the military said its forces shot dead a 43yearold Palestinian woman after she tried to stab a soldier in the northern West Bank near Beka ot settlement. The Palestinian Red Crescent rescue service said that it had recovered 14 bodies from an Israeli raid in the Nur Shams urban refugee camp in the West Bank that began late Thursday. Those killed include three militants from the Islamic Jihad group and a 15yearold boy. The military said it killed 14 militants and arrested eight suspects. Ten Israeli soldiers and one border police officer were wounded. In a separate incident in the West Bank an Israeli man was wounded in an explosion on Sunday the Magen David Adom rescue service said. A video circulating online shows a man approaching a Palestinian flag planted in a field. When he kicks it it appears to trigger an explosive device. At least 469 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers and settlers in the West Bank since the start of the IsraelHamas war according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. Most have been killed during Israeli military raids or in violent protests. The war was sparked by an unprecedented Oct. 7 raid into southern Israel in which Hamas and other militants killed around 1200 people mostly civilians and abducted around 250 hostages. Israel says militants are still holding around 100 hostages and the remains of more than 30 others. Thousands of Israelis have taken to the streets to call for a new election to replace Netanyahu and a deal with Hamas to release the hostages. Netanyahu has vowed to continue the war until Hamas is destroyed and all hostages are returned. The war has killed at least 34097 Palestinians and wounded another 76980 according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry doesn t differentiate between combatants and civilians in its count. It says the real toll is likely higher as many bodies are stuck beneath the rubble or in areas that medics can t reach. Israel blames Hamas for civilian casualties because the militants fight in dense residential neighborhoods. The military rarely comments on individual strikes which often kill women and children. The military says it has killed more than 13000 Hamas fighters without providing evidence. Samy Magdy reported from Cairo. Jack Jeffery contributed to this report from Jerusalem.

https://www.economist.com/briefing/2024/03/21/the-war-in-gaza-may-topple-hamas-without-making-israel-safer,  I WISH I could say we have a very detailed plan an Israeli army officer admitted to your correspondent in the chaotic days following Hamas s brutal assault on southern Israel on October 7th. More than 1100 people had been killed some 240 had been dragged back to Gaza as hostages. It was clear from the outset of the war in Gaza now six months old that Israel s two main goals to eliminate Hamas and to free the hostages were at odds. It was also clear that invading the territory in which 2.2m people live cheek by jowl and under which Hamas had built a labyrinth of fortified tunnels to help it withstand an attack was going to be immensely difficult. And there was always the risk that war in Gaza would spiral into a bigger conflict. It is possible to look at this unpromising starting point and conclude that Israel s invasion of Gaza has not gone badly and many Israelis take just that view. After all Hamas s fighting capacity has been massively reduced with little in the way of Israeli casualties. Some of the hostages have been released and negotiations continue in an attempt to free the remainder. And all the while there has been no regional conflagration nor even much unrest in the West Bank the more populous of the two Palestinian territories or among Israelis of Palestinian origin. Yet others question whether Israel s security has improved at all. Hamas s leader in Gaza and the mastermind of the attacks of October 7th Yahya Sinwar remains at large. The devastation Israel has unleashed around 20000 civilians have perished food and medicine are in desperately short supply and more than half the territory s buildings have been destroyed or damaged will make it almost impossible to institute a stable peaceful regime after the war. And Israel s perceived indifference to civilian suffering is eroding international sympathy and prompting allies to question their support. Could Israel the sceptics ask be winning the battle but losing the war? Read all our coverage of the war between Israel and Hamas The view that the war has been a success starts with the damage done to Hamas. Israeli officials claim that they have killed 13000 Hamas fighters around half of the group s prewar strength. Some foreign spies suggest a lower toll of perhaps a third. Hamas itself admitted casualties of at least 6000 in midFebruary. While it is hard to know which figure is accurate the damage is real. Most of Hamas s brigades have been mauled. It has lost commanders too. This week news emerged of the death of Marwan Issa the deputy leader of its military wing during an airstrike on Gaza in early March. Saleh alArouri another senior leader of the military wing was assassinated in Beirut in January. Israel meanwhile has lost around 250 soldiers during its ground invasion the most in any war since the 1980s but far fewer than many feared from intense urban warfare. Hamas s estimated arsenal of 20000 rockets is depleted. It has fired 60 of them to little effect and thousands more have been destroyed. Its network of tunnels has been badly damaged especially in northern Gaza. Short of men and materiel it will probably not pose a serious threat to Israel or even run Gaza again in years if it ever does. Polling suggests the group s popularity there has fallen sharply presumably because many Gazans blame Hamas for dragging them into a hellish war it could not hope to win. Only 38 want to see Hamas retain power after the war. At the same time Israel has managed to free almost half of the hostages without making any big concessions to Hamas. That is no comfort to the families of the 130 or so still unaccounted for perhaps a quarter of whom are already dead the army estimates. But it is a better outcome than many people expected immediately after October 7th. What is more Israel has done all this without triggering serious violence by other Palestinians either in the West Bank or inside Israel itself. It has also maintained an equilibrium on its northern border. Hizbullah a Lebanese Shia militant group has kept up neardaily missile attacks on Israel but it has stopped short of opening a full second front. At home the public set aside a year of political acrimony and rallied around the flag. Reservists reported for duty as required which some had threatened not to do last year at the height of public protests about a controversial judicial overhaul since shelved. The crossparty war cabinet formed in the wake of the attacks has held together for five months despite deep animosity between its members. The economy has suffered a predictable contraction but the shekel has pared its initial losses. Public debt will rise from 60 of GDP last year to a projected 67 by 2025 but that is still manageable and the central bank has a healthy cushion of 207bn in foreign reserves. Many foreigners have expressed outrage at the war s toll on civilians but Israelis consider this normal. Moreover the outrage has not translated into action. Most close Western allies including America Britain and Germany have not even called for a permanent ceasefire let alone taken any sort of punitive action against Israel. Even the six Arab states with which Israel has diplomatic relations have not done much beyond recalling their ambassadors despite popular anger at Israel s conduct of the war. Israelis can still board daily flights from Tel Aviv to Dubai. But none of this considers the longer term. Start with security. Body counts are a poor measure of success in an asymmetric war. America learned this lesson in Vietnam and then again in Afghanistan and Iraq. It seems unlikely that militant groups will have trouble recruiting in future amid Gaza s ruins. When the war ends Gaza will be unlivable. Hundreds of thousands of people will lack homes to return to. Researchers at the City University of New York and Oregon State University estimate that at least 55 of the buildings in Gaza have suffered structural damage see map. The economy has been obliterated factories have been bombed small businesses wiped out crops and livestock destroyed. Tanks have ripped up the roads and air strikes have wrecked the power grid and water network. The UN estimates that 76 of Gaza s schools have been damaged or destroyed. Its hospitals are in equally dire shape. Educated people will try to start new lives abroad. Humbler migrants will attempt to flee too trying their luck on boats to Europe. Most Gazans however will have no choice but to endure. They will linger for months perhaps years in crowded shelters and tent cities with few opportunities for work and nothing but aid on which to subsist. The enclave already populated in large part by the descendants of refugees from what is now Israel will become a giant displacement camp. If Hamas tries to emerge from its tunnels when the fighting ends and reassert its writ it is likely to fail given its diminished strength and wilting popularity let alone the likelihood of further conflict with Israel. Instead it may revert to its days as a guerrilla force carrying out attacks on Israeli troops and on Palestinians deemed to be collaborators. But the Palestinian Authority PA the moderate body that governs part of the West Bank will also struggle to swoop in and take power. It can barely keep control of the territory it currently administers and has been absent from Gaza since Hamas expelled it in 2007. Mahmoud Abbas its ageing president is scrambling to contain support for Hamas in his own statelet 62 of West Bankers say the militants should represent the Palestinian cause compared with just 43 of Gazans. Fully 88 of Palestinians want Mr Abbas to resign and he lacks a clear successor. On March 14th he named Mohammad Mustafa an economist as prime minister. He hopes that will show sceptical Western donors that he is serious about reforming the notoriously corrupt PA. But for many the underwhelming gesture merely affirmed how clueless and incapable the PA has become. America and its Arab allies hope to reactivate thousands of idle Gazan policemen who worked for the PA before Hamas s takeover and have since been paid to sit at home. But the rightwing elements of Israel s government do not like this idea and anyway it is unlikely to work. The Gazan police were unable to stop Hamas taking control of the enclave in 2007 and have presumably not become more effective after 17 years leave. Authority will probably devolve to powerful clans which are already trying to control the flow of aid. Instead of a functioning government Gaza may end up with warlords. But whatever emerges from the wreckage it is unlikely to make Israelis feel secure. For decades Israel s security doctrine has rested on three pillars deterrence early warning and decisive victory. If the first two failed as they occasionally did Israel fought short sharp wars to restore deterrence. Those conflicts had limited consequences on the home front. During a previous war against Hamas in 2014 the longest until this one the civilian death toll in Israel was a mere six people for Palestinians it was around 1500. All three pillars have now crumbled. Hamas was not deterred from carrying out an audacious attack. Israel s vaunted intelligence services failed. So did an array of hightech gadgets meant to monitor the border with Gaza. And the war that followed has been neither short nor decisive. In October Israel needed support from America which sent two aircraftcarrier groups to the region to deter Hizbullah and other armed groups from opening a second front. While Hizbullah has not launched an allout attack on Israel it has done enough to displace 80000 Israelis from cities and towns in the north. When the fighting in Gaza ends they will have to decide whether to return to the north knowing an adversary far better equipped than Hamas lurks just across the border. The Israel Democracy Institute a nonpartisan thinktank asks Israelis each month whether they are optimistic about the future of national security . Its first wartime survey in late October found that 46 of Israeli Jews were hopeful. By March that number had fallen to 41. Half a year of war has made Israelis feel less safe not more. The selfconfidence of all of Israel has changed dramatically and will never be the same as what it was before says an army officer. Part of the problem is domestic politics. Threequarters of Israelis want Mr Netanyahu to resign they are split on whether he should do so now or after the war. The public holds him responsible for October 7th not only for missing warning signs but also for his yearsold policy of strengthening Hamas to undermine the PA. He spurns talk of resignation or responsibility. His media outriders the poison machine as his critics call it have spent months trying to shift the blame elsewhere. Mr Netanyahu himself even took a wartime swipe at the army in a sincedeleted tweet. Mr Netanyahu is deepening the divisions by pandering to his farright coalition partners presumably in the hope of warding off an early election. Take his wartime budget approved by the Knesset earlier this month. It imposes deep cuts on civilian ministries but preserves a number of goodies for the religious right. There is 1.7bn shekels 467m for ultraOrthodox schools which often ignore the state curriculum and another 200m shekels for a makework ministry led by a farright settler. At the same time Israelis displaced from the north and south complain that the government has offered little help beyond paying their hotel bills. Even the war itself has become divisive. Israelis are split over whether to continue fighting in pursuit of the total victory promised by Mr Netanyahu or to stop to facilitate a hostage deal. Just 42 of Israelis want to keep going whereas 47 are ready to call a halt see chart 1. The police overseen by Itamar BenGvir a farright cabinet member have blasted water cannons at the families of hostages protesting against the government while handling with kid gloves farright activists who try to block the delivery of aid to Gaza. Benny Gantz a former army chief who joined the unity government in October is the favourite to succeed Mr Netanyahu in an election although he has yet to work out how to engineer one. If he becomes prime minister he will spend much of his time dealing with the fallout from the war. Longer conscription terms and a heavier burden on reservists will be a drag on the economy. Higher defence spending and the cost of rebuilding battered towns near the borders will necessitate cuts in other areas or higher taxes or both. His voters will be divided and traumatised and on top of that he will have to contend with a paroxysm of global outrage. Before the war the Arab world was drifting toward normalisation with Israel. No longer. Gaza s trauma has been a constant fixture on Arab television screens and smartphones since October not only scenes of death and desperation but also an endless torrent of dehumanising Israeli rhetoric about Palestinians. The authorities in Saudi Arabia have spent years trying to prepare their population for normalisation with Israel but a survey released in December by the Washington Institute a proIsraeli think tank found that 96 of Saudis thought Arab countries should sever all ties with Israel. Supporters of the Abraham accords the agreement in 2020 that saw four Arab states recognise Israel say they can still be expanded. That would require Arab leaders to ignore nearuniversal opposition. Perhaps they will they are all autocrats but that is hardly a strong foundation for a treaty which has anyway lost much of its strategic rationale. The accords were not just about allowing Israelis to holiday in Dubai. They were also meant to cement a regional alliance against Iran and to foster an outsidein approach to resolving the IsraeliPalestinian conflict as Arab states established ties with Israel they would press the Palestinians to sign a peace deal too. Both goals now seem out of reach. Gulf states have backed away from confrontation with Iran lest it lead to attacks on their own countries. And with the Israeli right citing the atrocities of October 7th as further reason to disavow a twostate solution which it has anyway resisted for decades bringing Palestinians around does not seem like the main obstacle. It is not only Arab opinion that has shifted. Even before the war young people in the West were less proIsrael than their elders. A survey in 2022 by the Pew Research Centre a polling outfit found that just 41 of Americans aged 18 to 29 had a favourable view of Israel compared with 69 of over65s. The war has widened that gulf. A YouGov poll in February found that 20 of Americans over 65 but 39 of 18 to 29yearolds consider Israel an apartheid state see chart 2. When Gallup asked Americans last month whether they sympathise more with Israelis or Palestinians old people picked Israel by a 40point margin whereas young ones chose Palestinians 45 to 37. Results are similar across the Atlantic 52 of young Britons think Israel s war is unjustified compared with 36 of over65s. Israelis tend to dismiss this. There may be some angst on college campuses and in lefty synagogues they argue but it has not swayed Western officials. Unless today s students become far more hawkish however Israel s future support looks shaky. And even some of today s politicians are unexpectedly wobbly. Chuck Schumer of New York is perhaps the most proIsrael Democrat in the Senate. He was one of just four Democratic senators to vote against the nuclear deal with Iran in 2015 siding with Mr Netanyahu over Barack Obama. On March 14th though he delivered a broadside against Mr Netanyahu from the Senate floor saying the prime minister had lost his way and calling for early elections to replace him. Mr Schumer has not given up on Israel. For now his anger like that of some other Democrats is aimed at Mr Netanyahu they want a new Israeli leader not a rupture in the alliance. Optimists in Israel hope that a change in their government will put them back in America s good graces. Perhaps it would but only for a time. A coalition led by Mr Gantz would probably include rightwing parties opposed to a twostate solution it is unlikely to do much to curtail settlements revive the peace process or advance other American interests. And it is unlikely to take power before autumn at the earliest. The longer Mr Netanyahu remains in power the longer the unthinkable starts to become plausible in American politics. Withholding military aid to Israel or imposing conditions on it used to be ideas expressed only on the political fringe. Now they have become mainstream. Even the likes of Chris Coons a centrist Democratic senator and confidant of Mr Biden has discussed such notions publicly. A showdown may be coming. Mr Biden has said that an Israeli incursion into Rafah the only city in Gaza it has not overrun would be a red line because of the likelihood of lots more civilian casualties. Mr Netanyahu says flatly that Israeli troops will enter Rafah at some point. Mr Biden may back down. He has shown no appetite for confrontation with Israel thus far. If Donald Trump succeeds him as president there will be even less chance of a clash. He attacks Mr Biden and other Democrats as insufficiently supportive of Israel and any Jews who vote for Democrats as hating Israel and their religion. Nonetheless a Rubicon has been crossed in that military assistance for Israel is now subject to open debate. Take for instance the instructions the president gave the State Department in February to report on whether foreign governments are committing atrocities with American weapons. This is a boxticking exercise for now but future politicians may not use it that way. America has also imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank these could be broadened to ensnare politicians like Mr BenGvir. By the same token federal law bars military aid to states that commit war crimes. Should the State Department implicate Israel America would have to curtail its support. The International Court of Justice is hearing a complaint brought by South Africa that Israel is committing genocide in Gaza. Even if it rejects it the International Criminal Court which hears complaints against individuals rather than countries may take up other cases. It started probing possible war crimes in Israel and the occupied territories in 2019. Belgium has promised it 5m 5.4m to investigate potential crimes in the current war. The court will presumably want something to show for these efforts. South Africa s foreign minister said earlier this month that citizens who fight with the Israeli army in Gaza would be arrested when they return home. Liberal Israelis have long warned of a future in which their politicians and generals are no longer free to travel abroad lest they be hauled off to The Hague. That day may not be here yet but it is closer than it was six months ago. The war is also reviving old political rifts. In the 1990s and early 2000s conflict with the Palestinians was a seminal issue for Israeli voters. Then the peace camp collapsed and the topic faded into the background. Over the past 15 years Israel s elections have been referendums on Mr Netanyahu s continued rule. In 2015 the main opposition party s campaign slogan was It s us or him . The next election may be the last such referendum. Mr Netanyahu s popularity has evaporated he is on trial for corruption and after the war he will face a commission of inquiry investigating October 7th and the war. It is hard to imagine even such a survivor winning another term. Yet Mr Netanyahu s exit if it comes will not end political discord. Moderate Israelis pine for a leader who will drag their politics back to the centre. They want someone to marginalise the extreme right end draft exemptions for ultraOrthodox Jews and strengthen democratic norms. But the maladroit Mr Gantz seems an unlikely candidate. The Palestinians will be back on the agenda a subject the right has tended to exploit by stoking voters fears with great political success. Critics offer a long list of things Israel could have done differently since October 7th. It could have provided far more humanitarian aid to Gaza and censured chauvinist politicians with their talk of ethnic cleansing. It could have waited to retaliate and then opted for limited specialforces raids rather than wholesale aerial bombardment. It could have been open to discussing postwar arrangements with America and Arab states. Some of these complaints are valid. The hunger in Gaza is both a moral failure and a strategic liability for Israel. Others are fanciful. Few armies would eschew a blitz from above before tossing their troops into urban warfare. Yet the biggest problem with the war is not its conduct but its likely outcome that it will leave Israel even more deeply mired in an occupation that has warped its society and poisoned its foreign relations for decades. Israel is not solely to blame for this lamentable situation of course. A rejectionist streak runs deep among Palestinians even though it has brought them only misery since 1948. When the fighting stops both Israel and Hamas will probably claim victory. In fact no one is winning.

https://www.pewresearch.org/2024/03/21/majority-in-u-s-say-israel-has-valid-reasons-for-fighting-fewer-say-the-same-about-hamas/, The remaining 2051 respondents are members of three other survey panels Ipsos KnowledgePanel SSRS s Opinion Panel and NORC at the University of Chicago s AmeriSpeak Panel who were interviewed because they identify as Jewish or Muslim. We oversampled i.e. interviewed a disproportionately large number of Jews and Muslims to provide more reliable estimates of their views on the topics covered in this survey. But these groups are not overrepresented in the national estimates reported here because we adjusted for the oversampling in the weighting of the data. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education religious affiliation and other categories. In total 1941 Jewish and 414 Muslim respondents participated in this survey. While the sample design was identical for Jews and Muslims the resulting sample sizes are different. There are two main reasons for this. The Jewish population in the United States is roughly double the size of the Muslim population. Consequently national survey panels have roughly twice as many or more Jewish panelists as Muslim ones. In addition decades of research on survey nonresponse has shown that some groups in the U.S. are more likely to participate in surveys than others. Generally speaking Jewish adults are more likely to participate in surveys than Muslim adults. The survey also included questions about where people were born and whether people identify as Arab or of Arab origin. Because of insufficient sample size we are unable to analyze Arab Americans or Americans of Israeli or Palestinian descent separately. In this survey Jews and Muslims are defined as U.S. adults who answer a question about their current religion by saying they are Jewish or Muslim respectively. Unlike our 2020 report on Jews in America this report does not separately analyze the views of Jews of no religion i.e. people who identify as Jewish culturally ethnically or by family background but not by religion. For more information on how we conducted this survey refer to the ATP s Methodology and the Methodology for this report. Read the questions used in this report along with responses. Months into the IsraelHamas war roughly sixinten Americans 58 say Israel s reasons for fighting Hamas are valid. But how Israel is carrying out its response to Hamas Oct. 7 attack receives a more mixed evaluation. About fourinten U.S. adults 38 say Israel s conduct of the war has been acceptable and 34 say it has been unacceptable. The remaining 26 are unsure. Only around oneinfive Americans 22 think the way the Israeli government is carrying out the war against Hamas will make the Israeli people more secure than they were before the war. The rest think the war will make Israelis less secure 27 not have much effect 15 or say they are unsure 35. When asked about Hamas reasons for fighting Israel far fewer Americans 22 describe them as valid. And just 5 of U.S. adults say the way Hamas carried out its Oct. 7 attack on Israel was acceptable while 66 describe it as completely unacceptable. Also few Americans 10 think Hamas actions will make the creation of an independent Palestinian state more likely than it was before the war. Around a third of the U.S. public thinks it will make an independent state less likely 32 while 15 say it will not have much effect and 41 are unsure.  Some questions in this survey ask Americans for opinions on how Israel and Hamas have been fighting. Other questions ask for opinions on why each side has been fighting. After pretesting the questions here is the exact wording we settled on This issue is challenging for many people both emotionally and in terms of understanding the specifics of the war. Many Americans are also disengaged Relatively few 22 say they are closely following news about the war and half can correctly report that more Palestinians than Israelis have died since the war s start. On many questions about the war sizable numbers express no opinion. These and other results come from a new Pew Research Center survey conducted Feb. 1325 among 12693 adults. Unlike most polling in the United States since the war began this survey includes enough Jewish and Muslim respondents to allow their views to be analyzed separately. When it comes to how Jews and Muslims feel about why and how the two sides are fighting we find In the U.S. 62 of Jews and 53 of Muslims report that hearing or reading news about the IsraelHamas war makes them afraid. In other religious and nonreligious groups the share expressing fear is lower. Jews are also more likely than other U.S. religious groups to say news about the conflict makes them feel angry. American Jews and Muslims are also paying more attention to the war than other groups analyzed with 61 of Jews and 41 of Muslims saying they re following it extremely or very closely. Pew Research Center surveys conducted on our American Trends Panel ATP always include Jews and Muslims. But these surveys do not always have enough Jewish or Muslim respondents to report their answers separately. This is because they make up relatively small shares of the U.S. adult population Roughly 2 of Americans say their religion is Judaism and 1 say their religion is Islam. To provide more reliable estimates of Jewish and Muslim views on the topics covered in this survey we included Jewish and Muslim respondents from three other national panels run by large research organizations Ipsos NORC and SSRS. All these panels are probability based meaning they use random sampling methods to recruit respondents. They are not optin polls. In total 1941 Jewish and 414 Muslim respondents participated in this survey. In this report Jews and Muslims are defined as U.S. adults who answer a question about their current religion by saying they are Jewish or Muslim respectively. Unlike our 2020 report on Jews in America this report does not analyze the views of Jews of no religion i.e. people who identify as Jewish culturally ethnically or by family background but not by religion. While the sample design was identical for Jews and Muslims the resulting sample sizes are different. There are two main reasons for this. The Jewish population in the U.S. is roughly double the size of the Muslim population. Consequently national survey panels have roughly twice as many or more Jewish panelists as Muslim ones. In addition decades of research on survey nonresponse has shown that some groups in the U.S. are more likely to participate in surveys than others. Generally speaking Jewish adults are more likely to participate in surveys than Muslim adults. There are also stark differences across age groups in views of the war. For example Age differences also are evident in many other issues related to the war which are explored in other chapters of this report. Some key findings include Related How Americans view the conflicts between Russia and Ukraine Israel and Hamas and China and Taiwan Few Americans say they sympathize entirely with either the Israeli people 11 or the Palestinian people 5. Rather 57 sympathize at least to some extent with both Israelis and Palestinians including 26 who say their sympathies lie equally with both groups. A much smaller share of U.S. adults 8 say they do not sympathize with either group while 18 are unsure. To the degree that Americans sympathize more with one group than the other 31 say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Israeli people. This is about twice as many as say their sympathies lie either entirely or mostly with the Palestinian people 16. By a margin of more than 21 adults under 30 sympathize relatively more with Palestinians than with Israelis 33 vs. 14 while the balance of opinion is reversed among older age groups. Much of this is related to young Democrats and Democratic leaners 47 of whom sympathize either mostly or entirely with Palestinians. Young Republicans and GOP leaners on the other hand are slightly more likely to sympathize either entirely or mostly with Israel 28 or with both sides equally 24 than entirely or mostly with Palestinians 12. Substantial shares of both young Democrats 19 and young Republicans 24 say they are unsure where their sympathies lie. Americans tend to express much more favorable views of the people on both sides of the IsraelHamas war than of the leadership on either side the Israeli government the Palestinian Authority and Hamas. For example 64 of U.S. adults say they have a favorable view of the Israeli people compared with 41 who express a favorable view of the Israeli government. The same is true of views of the Palestinian people 50 favorable compared with either the Palestinian Authority which controls the West Bank 23 favorable and especially relative to Hamas which has controlled Gaza in recent years 8 favorable. Indeed sixinten Americans express very unfavorable views of Hamas. Views of the Israeli government have become more negative since 2022. Today 41 of U.S. adults express a favorable view of the Israeli government down from 47. The share who express very unfavorable views of the government also has nearly doubled over this time period from 12 to 21. We do not have data on how views of the Palestinian Authority or Hamas have changed over time. Among adults under 30 the share expressing a favorable view of the Israeli people has fallen 17 percentage points since 2019 while their views of the Palestinian people have not shifted over this timespan. Older people s views of both Israelis and Palestinians have remained largely unchanged. How to describe the current war both for the respondents taking the survey and when writing up the results is not a choice we made lightly.  First we consulted The Associated Press Stylebook a resource we often follow. According to the AP Stylebook The Associated Press is calling the present conflict between Israel and the militant Palestinian group Hamas a war Do not use terms such as IsraelPalestinian war or Gaza war.  Second we consulted with outside experts who recommended we avoid terminology suggesting that Israeli forces are fighting only in Gaza when in reality they are also active on other fronts including against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Third we conducted pretests with 17 respondents and asked them Do you have thoughts on using the phrase IsraelGaza war instead of IsraelHamas war ? While around half did not have an opinion among those who did several felt IsraelHamas war was more accurate. For example one respondent said It should be the IsraelHamas war because it s not a Gaza thing it s Hamas versus Israel. They started it. Another noted I don t agree with saying IsraelGaza war. It s IsraelHamas. That s who they are going after. Still two respondents said the opposite. One said It s more IsraelGaza than IsraelHamas because it s not really Jews against Palestinians so we should focus on a country and that region. Another said Gaza sounds bigger than the Hamas part does. All 17 respondents said the questions we asked seemed neutral rather than appearing to favor a particular side in the ongoing war. After completing the survey the 12693 respondents who took it were also asked whether they found the survey to be politically neutral and 92 did including large majorities of Muslims and Jews. Americans are divided about how and whether the U.S. should be involved in the IsraelHamas war. Democrats and Democraticleaning independents differ sharply from Republicans and Republicanleaning independents in their attitudes toward U.S. involvement in the war. Democrats are much more supportive than Republicans of providing humanitarian aid in Gaza 66 vs. 35 and of the U.S. playing a major diplomatic role in resolving the war 25 vs. 16. Indeed Republicans are twice as likely to say the U.S. should play no role 32 as they are to say the U.S. should play a major role 16 in solving the conflict 37 support the U.S. playing a minor role. However Republicans are twice as likely as Democrats to favor providing military aid to Israel to help in its war against Hamas 50 vs. 25. U.S. public opinion is deeply divided and to a large extent uncertain about whether President Joe Biden is striking the right balance in his approach to the war 21 favoring the Israelis too much 22 or favoring the Palestinians too much 16. The largest single slice of the public 40 is not sure how well Biden is handling the issue. While these views are broadly similar to what we found in a December 2023 Pew Research Center survey opinion among those under 30 has shifted. In the February survey 36 of those ages 18 to 29 say Biden is favoring Israel too much up from 27 just a few months ago. Explore this further in Chapter 2. American Jews stand out for the relatively high share who say Biden is striking the right balance 45. Only around a quarter or fewer in most other religious groups say the same including just 6 of U.S. Muslims. Muslims are among the U.S. religious groups that are most inclined to say Biden favors the Israelis too much 60. Among other religious and nonreligious groups atheists 52 and agnostics 43 are especially likely to express this view. One of the few opinions a solid majority of Americans can agree on when it comes to the IsraelHamas war is that lasting peace is unlikely. Only 3 say it is either extremely or very likely while 9 say it s somewhat likely. Fully 68 say a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians is either not too or not at all likely. Opinion is somewhat more mixed when it comes to the best possible outcome of the conflict. A plurality 40 says the best outcome would be a twostate solution splitting the land into two countries one with an Israeli government and one with a Palestinian government. But many Americans remain unsure of the best outcome 30 and some prefer a model in which all the land is one country with an Israeli government 14 or one country that is jointly governed by Israelis and Palestinians 13. Few prefer the land to be one country with a Palestinian government 2. Jewish Americans 46 and Muslim Americans 41 also tend to think a twostate solution is the best possible outcome but about oneinfive people in each group support a onestate option. Among Jews 22 would prefer for all the land to be one country with an Israeli government. Among Muslims 20 would like all the land to be under a Palestinian government. Overall Americans support for a twostate solution has increased modestly since 2022 from 35 to 40. Much of the shift has come among Democrats and Democraticleaning independents. Today 48 of Democrats favor a twostate solution up from 36 in 2022. Indeed this shift has opened up a partisan gap in views of the twostate solution that was not present in 2022. Among Republicans the twostate solution is endorsed by 33 while 26 think the best outcome would be for a single country with an Israeli government to control all the land.

https://www.cnn.com/middleeast/live-news/israel-hamas-war-gaza-news-04-21-24/index.html, Live Live By Simone McCarthy Sana Noor Haq Antoinette Radford and Maureen Chowdhury CNN Israeli troops have concluded a twoday operation in the Nur alShams refugee camp in the occupied West Bank the Israel Defense Forces told CNN on Sunday. Images from the raid one of the IDFs largest in the West Bank since October 7 show concrete slabs and rubble strewn across the area. At least 14 people including a child and a teen were killed in the raid the Palestinian Ministry of Health and official news agency Wafa said Saturday. Israel says it killed 10 terrorists and arrested wanted suspects. Violence by Israeli settlers and IDF troops in the West Bank has surged during Israels campaign in Gaza. Settlers killed an ambulance driver trying to transport injured Palestinians on Saturday the Palestine Red Crescent said. According to the health ministry 483 Palestinians have been killed by settlers or Israeli soldiers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7. Heres what else to know if youre just joining us  The Israeli war cabinet met late Sunday local time to discuss efforts to free the remaining hostages held in Gaza according to an Israeli official. The war cabinet is made up of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Minister of Defense Yoav Gallant and Benny Gantz who is chairman of the National Unity Party. In a video statement released by the Government Press Office to mark Passover on Sunday Netanyahu said This night 133 of our dear brothers and sisters do not sit at the Seder table and are still imprisoned in the hell of Hamas. Netanyahu accused Hamas of rejecting proposals for a hostage deal outright and said Israel will soon land additional and painful blows and will increase military and political pressure on Hamas to free the hostages. State of the negotiations Talks on a ceasefire and hostage deal have been facilitated by international mediators for weeks but have yielded no apparent breakthroughs of late. The framework laid out by negotiators according to sources familiar with the talks would see a sixweek pause in fighting during which Hamas would release 40 of the remaining hostages including all the women as well as sick and elderly men. In exchange hundreds of Palestinian prisoners would be released from Israeli prisons. Hamas has told the mediators which include Qatar and Egypt it does not have 40 living hostages who match the criteria for release. CNN s record of the conditions of the hostages also suggests there are fewer than 40 living hostages who meet the proposed criteria. This post has been updated to reflect the meeting took place. Israeli troops have concluded a twoday operation in the Nur alShams refugee camp near Tulkarm in the occupied West Bank the Israel Defense Forces told CNN on Sunday.  Images from the offensive on the camp which appears to be one of the largest in the West Bank since October 7 show concrete slabs and rubble strewn across the area. At least 14 people including one child were killed in the raid the Palestinian Ministry of Health and official news agency Wafa said Saturday.  The IDF claimed security forces killed 10 terrorists and arrested eight wanted suspects during its extensive counterterrorism operation which started on Thursday.  Attacks on Palestinians Violence in the occupied West Bank has only increased during Israels offensive in Gaza. An ambulance driver from the Palestine Red Crescent Society was killed while transporting Palestinians injured in an attack by settlers in the West Bank on Saturday the Palestinian Ministry of Health said. Israeli settler attacks on Palestinians in the occupied territory increased in 2023 to their highest level since the UN began recording data in 2006 the Human Rights Watch reported Wednesday. At least 483 Palestinians have been killed by settlers or IDF soldiers in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem since October 7 according to the health ministry. The spike in violence by extremist settlers has led to more sanctions by the US and EU. This post has been updated with additional data on violence in the West Bank. Hamas has condemned the United States House of Representatives approval of a more than 26 billion foreign aid package for Israel calling it a violation of all international laws and humanitarian norms. The US administration and President Joe Biden Hamas said bear personal political legal and moral responsibility for what it described as war crimes in Gaza. The bill provides a green light for Israel to continue its brutal aggression in the strip Hamas said. The US House passed the Israel Security Supplemental Appropriations Act on Saturday with a vote of 36658. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan discussed efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza and the urgent need for a ceasefire during a meeting with Hamas top political leader Ismail Haniyeh in the capital Istanbul on Saturday his office said.  It was the first meeting between Erdogan and Haniyeh since October 7 when Israel began its military invasion into Gaza following Hamas attack. Earlier this week the Hamas leader held talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan in Doha. Erdogan said Turkey had provided Gaza with more than 45000 tons of humanitarian aid in order to alleviate some of the suffering and would continue to do so. Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip have killed 48 Palestinians in the past 24 hours the Health Ministry in Gaza reported on Sunday raising the total death toll to 34097 people killed.  At least 76980 people have been injured since October 7 the ministry said. A number of Palestinians are trapped under the rubble and destroyed roads the ministry added but ambulance and civil defense crews are unable to reach them. The vast majority of those killed in Gaza are women and children according to Palestinian health officials. As of April 20 the ministry reported  CNN cannot independently confirm the numbers due to the lack of international media access to Gaza. Israeli strikes hit four sites in southern Lebanon overnight Lebanese stateowned National News Agency reported as regional tensions intensify over Israels military campaign in Gaza. The strikes hit the villages of Khiam Tayr Harfa Kfarkella near Odaisseh and in an area between Ramieh and Beit Leif.  The Israeli military confirmed bombardment on three of the four locations hitting what it said were Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah is an Iranbacked Lebanese militant group with one of the most powerful paramilitary forces in the Middle East.  In Tayr Harfa Israeli forces said a terrorist was identified operating inside a Hezbollah military structure which fighter jets struck. Elsewhere Israeli troops hit an observation post in Odaisseh and two military structures in Khiam.  IsraelLebanon relations Israeli and Hezbollah forces have engaged in crossborder fire and titfortat exchanges since October 7 when Hamas launched an attack on Israel in which 1200 people were killed and more than 250 taken hostage. Hezbollah s political stance has unambiguously supported the Palestinian militants. It has roundly condemned Israel s relentless airstrikes on Gaza which have killed more than 34000 Palestinians and injured more than 76900 according to the Ministry of Health there.  CNNs Tamara Qiblawi and Abeer Salman contributed reporting. A West Bankwide labor strike has been called for Sunday a working day over Palestinian deaths in Tulkarem in the West Bank and Gaza Palestinian political faction Fatah said on Saturday according to official Palestinian news agency WAFA.  The strike calls on people to unite in support of our people Fatah said according to WAFA.  The Palestinian Teachers Union said that a general strike will be adhered to at all schools educational facilities and the ministry WAFA reported adding that the General Union of Transport Workers also said it is committed to adhering to the strike. Some context The call for a general strike was announced after 14 Palestinians were killed in an Israeli military operation in Nur Shams refugee camp near Tulkarem in the West Bank according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health.,
