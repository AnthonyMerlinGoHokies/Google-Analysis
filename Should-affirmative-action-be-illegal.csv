The Supreme Court shouldn t have ruled that colleges affirmativeaction programs are unconstitutional. It should have ruled that they re illegal. The Supreme Court was considering Regents of the University of California v. Bakke its first major case about affirmative action in university admissions. Both parties in the case had asked for a ruling on whether the 14th Amendment to the Constitution with its guarantee of equal protection to all people allowed universities to take applicants race into account. Stevens argued that the court did not need to answer that question to decide the case. Our settled practice he wrote is to avoid the decision of a constitutional issue if a case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided just such a statutory ground It forbids any institution receiving federal money from subjecting any person to discrimination based on race. It does not say that such discrimination may be allowed to rectify the effects of past discrimination or to construct demographically representative student bodies or to secure educational benefits from racial diversity. It flatly prohibits it. Continue reading at The Washington Post.
https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/22/what-is-affirmative-action-supreme-court-explainer, The US supreme court has banned the use of affirmativeaction policies that have been in place for decades Envisioned as a tool to help remedy historical discrimination and create more diverse student bodies affirmative action policies have permitted hundreds of colleges and universities to factor in students racial backgrounds during the admissions process. That consideration is supplementary and taken in tandem with other factors such as applicants test scores grades and extracurricular activities. Even with raceconscious admissions however many selective public and private colleges and universities struggle to enroll diverse student populations that accurately reflect society. At the University of North Carolina for example in a state where 21 of people are Black just 8 of the school s undergraduates are Black. Opponents of affirmative action such as the advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions argue that considering race as a factor in the admissions process amounts to racial discrimination particularly against Asian Americans. SFA has brought cases against Harvard University the nation s oldest private university and UNC the nation s first public university to challenge their affirmative action policies which the group contends favors Black and Latino students. Ultimately it hopes that race considerations will be nixed from the admissions process entirely and replaced by raceneutral or colorblind policies. The concept of affirmative action originated in 1961 when President John F Kennedy issued an executive order directing government agencies to ensure that all Americans get an equal opportunity in employment. President Lyndon Johnson took it one step further in 1965 barring public and private organizations that had a federal contract from discriminating based on race color religion and national origin. The prohibition was added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1969 President Richard Nixon s assistant labor secretary Arthur Fletcher who would eventually be known as the father of affirmative action pushed for requiring employers to set goals and timetables to hire more Black workers. That effort known as the Revised Philadelphia Plan would later influence how many schools approached their own raceconscious admissions programs. The practice was challenged when Allan Bakke a white man who was twice denied entry to the medical school at the University of California at Davis sued the university arguing that its policies which included allocating seats for qualified students of color discriminated against him. In 1978 the supreme court narrowly rejected the use of racial quotas but noted that colleges and universities could use race as a factor in the admissions process. Justice Lewis Powell noted that achieving diversity represented a compelling government interest . After generations of near total exclusion of Black students and other students of color colleges and universities began admitting more diverse groups in the 1960s and 70s and soon thereafter incorporated raceconsciousness into their admissions policies. Data shows that the rise of affirmative action policies in higher education has bolstered diversity on college campuses. In 1965 Black students accounted for roughly 5 of all undergraduates. And between 1965 and 2001 the percentage of Black undergraduates doubled. The number of Latino undergraduates also rose during that time. Still the practice of factoring race into the admissions process faced repeated attacks. In 1998 during an era of conservatism California voters approved Proposition 209 which outlawed affirmative action in any state or government agency including its university system. Since then eight more states have eliminated such raceconscious policies. The end of affirmative action at those state levels shows just how impactful the consideration of race in admissions has been a UC Berkeley study found that after the ban in California the number of applicants of color in the UC system sharply shifted away from UC s most selective Berkeley and UCLA campuses causing a cascade of students to enroll at lowerquality public institutions and some private universities . Specifically the number of Black freshmen admitted to UC Berkeley dropped to 3.6 between 2006 and 2010 almost half of its population before the ban. In an amicus brief in the Harvard case attorneys for the University of Michigan which had to stop considering race in admissions in 2006 argued that despite persistent vigorous and varied efforts to achieve diversity it has struggled to do so without raceconsciousness. The number of Black and Native American students has dramatically dropped since the end of affirmative action in the state. Though students of color remain underrepresented at selective colleges and universities today institutions argue that their presence helps shape students oncampus experiences. The removal of race consideration from college admissions could set a precedent for a less diverse school system which stands in stark contrast to an increasingly diverse world.
https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/future-college-admissions-without-affirmative-action, The US Supreme Court s upcoming affirmative action decision which many legal experts expect will limit or end the consideration of an applicant s race in college admissions would likely immediately hinder college and universities ability to maintain let alone increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their student bodies. Research on schools in states that have eliminated affirmative action suggests no other single admissions policy will produce current levels of racial and ethnic diversity on its own. What admissions policies have been enacted in states where affirmative action has already been banned? And what effect have those policies had on student racial diversity? In states that have eliminated affirmative action studies have consistently found declines in the admission and enrollment of Black Latinx and Indigenous people. These declines are especially concentrated in selective and flagship institutions. Evidence shows diversity in higher education improves learning outcomes for all students and the benefits extend beyond graduation. A ban could not only negatively affect students of color who would be less likely to attend selective institutions that usually have more resources and higher graduation rates but could also prevent other students at these universities from benefiting from the perspectives and experiences that having a more diverse class brings. Simulations that measure the consequences of banning affirmative action and the effectiveness of raceneutral policies find that although alternatives may mitigate the effects of the ban they will not fully make up for the loss of racial diversity on their own. However if the use of race is prohibited in college admissions the following approaches would likely be most adopted. A frequently discussed raceneutral admissions policy is a classbased admissions practice. Under this approach greater weight is given to applicants from less affluent socioeconomic backgrounds to recognize those students may not have had the same resources and educational opportunities as wealthier students. Black and Latinx households have disproportionally lower incomes because of structural barriers so applying a greater weight to an applicant s income status theoretically could produce a more racially diverse cohort of students.Multiple statistical models of this approach found absent other changes to the current admissions process classbased admissions on its own would not provide similar levels of diversity as racebased admissions. In its amicus brief the University of Michigan went a step further saying classbased admissions don t increase racial diversity and using it as the sole means to increase nonwhite enrollment can exacerbate stereotypes rather than alleviating them. PDFBecause there are more white people with low incomes than racially underrepresented people with low incomes and because people of color with low incomes also face systemic racism that further disadvantages them in the education system classbased affirmative action would likely not lead to racial diversity at the same levels as racebased affirmative action. After affirmative action was banned in California Texas and Florida each state implemented percentage plans PDF under which a certain percentage of the top students from a high school s graduating class would receive automatic admission to state universities. Texas s percentage plan developed by a special task force of the state legislature was adopted to combat the effects of the Hopwood ruling on diversity PDF. The idea was that by admitting students from various high schools around the state the state s universities would be more representative of Texas s population leading to greater diversity.Although these policies helped increase diversity at some schools they were less effective than racebased admissions policies in increasing Black and Latinx student enrollment because of Black and Latinx underrepresentation in the top percentages of high school classes and the fact that many of the racially underrepresented students at the top of their classes likely would have been admitted without the automatic admission plan.Additionally in Texas studies show that rebounds in the amount of racially or ethnically underrepresented students at state universities after the elimination of affirmative action are more attributable to the large increases of Latinx and Black people in the overall population than the state s top percentage plan. Data show application rates of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to selective institutions are not representative of their state s demographic composition. These students of color with similar qualifications as white students are also less likely to apply to moreselective schools even when eligible for automatic admission.Increased recruitment in areas with greater racial diversity can help inform prospective students about the application process and encourage them to apply but may not offset declines that occurred after affirmative action bans alone.For example Texas A M and the University of Texas at Austin created partnership programs with underrepresented schools to recruit and provide financial aid and support to a select number of students. But even with this program and automated admission those eligible for the scholarships and the top percentage plan were still less likely to enroll in these more selective universities relative to other high school students. The systemic exclusion of students of color from higher education means white students benefit most from legacy preferences in admissions. Many highly selective schools admit more legacy students than Black and Latinx applicants and the rate of admission for legacies is more than three times higher than for nonlegacy applicants.Ending legacy admissions could help make the higher education admission process more equitable. When Johns Hopkins University eliminated legacy preferences in 2014 the percentage of firstgeneration students increased by approximately 10 percent and the percentage of Pelleligible students increased by about 7 percent between 2013 and 2021. Though standardized tests for college admission are often found to benefit wealthy white students most research on the role of testoptional policies in increasing the racial diversity of applicants is inconclusive. However a study on the institutions that adopted the policy found the percentage of Black Latinx and Indigenous students and the percentage of Pelleligible students increased slightly at testoptional institutions compared with similar schools that still required SAT or ACT scores. Making tests optional or eliminating them could help selective institutions remove one barrier to students of color applying and being admitted. Research suggests colleges and universities particularly selective ones would experience a decrease in racial and ethnic diversity among their students if the Supreme Court ends racebased affirmative action because no single raceneutral admission policy has the same effect as raceconscious admissions. If overturned returning to current diversity levels would require a commitment to adopting a combination of the strategies above innovating these strategies or developing new ones. In the meantime better national data on the admissions process will be critical to understanding the effectiveness of raceneutral policies.

https://www.epi.org/blog/the-supreme-courts-ban-on-affirmative-action-means-colleges-will-struggle-to-meet-goals-of-diversity-and-equal-opportunity/, After extensive deliberation the Supreme Court has delivered a landmark ruling that effectively prohibits the use of racebased affirmative action in college admissions. Raceblind admissions processes will further exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine the recognition of the unique challenges that Black Hispanic and Native American students encounter throughout the admissions process. By disregarding the significance of race these approaches risk creating a wider divide between equal opportunity and communities of color.  This decision marks a significant setback for colleges which have relied on this tool for over 40 years to enhance racial diversity on their campuses and compensate for decades of both explicit and implicit racebased exclusion. Colleges must now explore options like targeted recruitment programs and using other metrics such as household income and wealth as substitutes for racebased admissions. However flagship schools from states that previously banned affirmative action and used these alternative tactics have a poor track record of success in achieving meaningful diversity gains in their student body without using affirmative action.  Over the years a total of nine states have implemented bans on affirmative action. This policy shift forced top educational institutions like the University of California and the University of Michigan to abandon racebased admissions and find new ways to admit diverse student bodies. As a result these universities made significant efforts to foster racial diversity by investing hundreds of millions of dollars in outreach programs. However according to two amicus briefs in support of affirmative action filed by these two universities last year to the Supreme Court these endeavors have proven to be ineffective. Both university systems revealed perpetually low enrollment rates among students of color despite their significant investment in alternative ways to boost diversity among the applicant pool and student body. Following California s implementation of Proposition 209 in 1996 which banned the use of racial preferences in admissions the state experienced a significant decline in enrollment rates across its educational institutions. Most notable was the decline in Black student enrollment at the University of California Los Angeles UCLA. In 2006 only 96 students less than 2 selfidentified as Black out of a freshman class of nearly 5000 students.  Although enrollment rates have shown some improvement since then disparities in enrollment persist. For example a mere 228 students 3 at the University of California Berkeley identified themselves as Black out of a nearly 7000strong freshman class in the fall of 2022. By comparison the 2021 2022 high school graduating class in California had approximately 8700 Black students that met the requirements for admission into the University of California system. These limited strides in fostering diversity have come at a substantial cost to the University of California system exceeding half a billion dollars in investments since 2004. Likewise at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor enrollment rates for students of color experienced a decline following the state s adoption of Proposal 2 commonly known as the Affirmative Action Initiative in 2006. This voter referendum also led to a state constitutional ban on raceconscious admissions. By 2021 Black enrollment stood at a mere 4 a three percentage point drop from 2006. This is despite the growth of collegeage African Americans in Michigan from 16 to 19. Clearly the University of Michigan has encountered challenges in ensuring that their flagship school reflects the diverse demographics of the state.  The ban on affirmative action has made it more arduous for many universities to achieve proportional representation of underrepresented groups and imposes new constraints in racial equity and equal opportunity in higher education. As an alternative to racebased admissions certain schools and advocates have suggested considering socioeconomic status including wealth as a criterion for preference in college admissions irrespective of race. However this raceblind alternative falls short in capturing the full scope of what racebased admissions could achieve. Focusing solely on socioeconomic status fails to address the specific obstacles that affirmative action was intended to combat.  One significant drawback of this raceblind approach is its potential exclusion of deserving middleclass Black Brown and Native American students. These students may not meet the criteria for preferential treatment based on low socioeconomic status despite facing racial disparities and encountering systemic barriers that hinder their educational opportunities. By overlooking the importance of race this alternative fails to acknowledge the need to uplift marginalized racial and ethnic groups who may not fit neatly into a socioeconomicbased framework. Moreover according to Richard Rothstein author of The Color of Law A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America and the recently released Just Action How to challenge segregation enacted under the color of law when considering wealthbased admissions it is important to acknowledge the significantly larger population of white Americans compared with African Americans. While a higher proportion of the Black population falls into the lowwealth category the potential pool of lowwealth applicants would still consist of a significantly larger number of white students. According to Federal Reserve data from 2019 31 of youths from households in the bottom quarter of the national wealth distribution with a net worth of 12400 or less are Black. Even if preference was given to students in the bottom half of the wealth distribution with a net worth of 121700 or less a smaller proportion of the eligible lowwealth applicants 24 would be Black. Despite the belief that Black people may be overrepresented in a wealthbased program the alternative would still be flawed in capturing many Black students. Classbased admissions based on household income have also been a popular alternative to racebased admissions but similarly to wealth this criteria would fall short of the diversity objectives set by admissions offices and undermine efforts to address discrimination. According to a study by Georgetown University s Center on Education and the Workforce selective colleges that are prohibited from considering race and ethnicity in admissions decisions may regain some level of racial and ethnic diversity by adopting classconscious admissions practices. However the study highlights the considerable difficulties these institutions would encounter in achieving student bodies that accurately reflect the demographic diversity of their state s high school population which typically exhibits higher rates of enrollment across different racial groups compared with universities. The findings suggest that maintaining or surpassing existing representation without raceconscious admissions would necessitate a complete overhaul of the admissions system requiring changes in applicant evaluation and consideration criteria. While socioeconomic status can be a relevant factor in addressing certain forms of disadvantage and college education should absolutely be more accessible to low and middleincome students of all races socioeconomic status alone cannot fully replace the multifaceted impact of racebased admissions.  The pending Supreme Court decision on student loan debt forgiveness adds an additional layer of complexity to using socioeconomic status as a proxy for race in achieving diversity. Student loan debt is yet another barrier hindering students of color from accessing higher education. Without student loan debt forgiveness students of color hailing from lowincome backgrounds encounter even greater disparities in economic outcomes. Irrespective of whether these students gain admission to universities based on their socioeconomic status the intersection of student loan debt structural racism and poverty magnifies the existing gaps in their ability to afford and enroll in higher education institutions. This could impede efforts to achieve a more inclusive and diverse student body based on race and socioeconomic factors.  The complexities of racial discrimination and the need for targeted measures to address historical injustices cannot be adequately captured by a raceblind approach alone. It is crucial to recognize the unique and ongoing struggles faced by underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and continue to advocate for holistic solutions that address both socioeconomic disparities and the significance of race in admissions policies. Affirmative action programs in higher education came into existence specifically to rectify the history of racebased exclusion legally enforced segregation and quota systems that capped the number of nonwhite or other minority students permitted to enroll at colleges and universities across the country. This history of discrimination had everything to do with barring students based on race regardless of their class and led to many of the enrollment disparities we still see today at many institutions. The adoption of raceblind admissions would not provide greater benefits to students of color compared with the existing impact of racebased admissions. Instead any alternative approach would likely harm the enrollment rates of these marginalized groups and prove financially burdensome to implement. It is imperative to recognize the significance of race in addressing systemic inequalities and to prioritize inclusive measures that safeguard access to higher education for underrepresented communities. Universities should persist in advocating for affirmative action specifically for Black Brown and Native American applicants. In an open letter issued a month before the Court s ruling the presidents of 27 liberal arts colleges stated To fulfill the promise of economic and social mobility we need to continue rectifying the systemic barriers that have kept so many talented students of color out of higher education. Rothstein argues that university presidents defending affirmative action programs on the grounds of rectifying past injustices could sway lowercourt judges and dissenting justices to support affirmative action as a valid remedy. This approach may also pave the way for future Supreme Court justices to reject raceblind ideologies that currently impede reform efforts. Ultimately maintaining intersectional admissions processes that include race is essential to promoting equity and redressing systemic barriers to higher education.

AP PhotoMichael Casey  By COLLIN BINKLEY Published hourminute AMPM timezone monthFull day year Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print Colleges across the country will be forced to stop considering race in admissions under Thursday s Supreme Court ruling ending affirmative action policies that date back decades.  Schools that have relied on raceconscious admissions policies to build diversity will have to rethink how they admit students. It s expected to result in campuses that have more white and Asian American students and fewer Black and Hispanic students. The impact of the decision will be felt most strongly at the nation s most selective colleges which have been more likely to consider race as one of many factors in admissions. But some less selective universities also consider race and hundreds of colleges may need to adjust their admissions systems in response to the decision. Colleges say they re still analyzing the decision but it s sure to have a dramatic impact nationwide. Here s what we know so far. Today s incoming high school seniors will be the first to see any change. Many of them will be applying for college over the next year as colleges remove race from admissions decisions. The process probably won t look much different for students maybe there will be another question or two about their life experiences but behind the scenes there could be big changes in the way colleges evaluate applications.   Columbia switches to hybrid learning amid protests over Israel s war in Gaza New federal rule bars transgender school bathroom bans but it likely isn t the final word With graduation near colleges seek to balance safety and students right to protest Gaza war At Northeastern University President Joseph E. Aoun said in a campus message the decision will dramatically alter the use of race as a factor in college admissions.  No one knows for sure. Colleges aren t required to disclose whether they consider race and the federal government doesn t track it. A survey of about 200 colleges in 2019 found that roughly four in 10 colleges said race had at least limited influence in admissions decisions. The practice is most common at highly selective institutions while many less selective schools don t consider race.  Nine states have separately banned affirmative action at private universities including California Michigan Florida and Washington.  In states that already banned affirmative action colleges responded by recruiting more lowincome students hoping that wealth would act as a proxy for race. Some colleges also started percentage plans that offer admission to top students at every high school in their state. Such approaches have had mixed results. But expect to see more colleges trying alternate approaches. An alternate approach floated by some would put greater emphasis on students who overcome adversity. President Joe Biden endorsed that approach Thursday saying adversity should be a new standard in college admissions rewarding those who overcome challenges related to income race or other factors.  The court s decision appears to allow such an approach. The conservative majority wrote that nothing prohibits universities from considering an applicant s discussion of how race affected the applicant s life as long as it s tied to a particular quality the applicant brings to campus. Applicants may see more colleges add questions about adversity or other life experiences. But the decision also warns about going too far saying colleges can t simply use essays to revive the regime we hold unlawful today.  What s clear is that any direct consideration of race in admission decisions will have to end meaning colleges will no longer be able to give an edge to underrepresented minorities simply because of their race. With affirmative action off the table colleges face mounting pressure to end other admission practices that disproportionately benefit white and wealthy students. Chief among those are legacy preferences the practice of giving an admission boost to the children of alumni. Within hours of the decision activists and some Democrats in Congress were urging colleges to abandon the policy. Biden took a shot at it too saying he s asking the Education Department to examine legacy preferences and other practices that expand privilege instead of opportunity. A small but notable group of colleges have dropped the practice in recent years including Johns Hopkins University and Amherst College but it continues at many others including Harvard and other Ivy League schools. Activists are also taking aim at other policies seen as barriers for underrepresented students including donor preferences and standardized tests like the SAT and ACT. Hundreds of colleges made entrance exams optional during the pandemic and there s a growing push to make the change permanent. Colleges across the country said they re committed to campus diversity no matter what the court says. Campus leaders say they re still sorting how the decision will affect them but many expressed optimism that they will legally find other ways to bring a diverse mix of students to campus. In Texas Rice University s president said he s greatly disappointed but also more resolute than ever to pursue diversity. The law may change but Rice s commitment to diversity will not President Reginald DesRoches said. At Union College in New York President David Harris said students of color will continue to feel welcome but make no mistake this Supreme Court decision will make our work more challenging he said. Colleges are sending a welcoming message in hopes of avoiding the type of dropoff among Black and Hispanic students that have been seen in some states that outlawed affirmative action. In several decisions dating to the 1970s the Supreme Court had upheld affirmative action in college admissions. Past rulings found that colleges have a compelling interest in promoting racial diversity because of the benefits it provides. They say it exposes students to differing viewpoints and helps prepare future leaders among other benefits. Colleges say race has been a small factor sometimes giving an edge to underrepresented students. Opponents dispute that notion citing research finding a boost for Black applicants equivalent to 310 points on the SAT exam. Thursday s decision reversed course on the earlier decisions. The court found that while the benefits cited by universities are commendable they don t pass legal muster because they aren t concrete enough to be measured and they don t have a clear end goal. The universities main response to these criticisms is essentially trust us the court wrote.  The Associated Press education team receives support from the Carnegie Corporation of New York.

https://stanfordmag.org/contents/the-case-against-affirmative-action,  Reading time min     000 000 1.0x By David Sacks and Peter Thiel Read the companion piece to this story The Case For Affirmative Action. For the past quarter of a century Stanford has been discriminating in favor of racial minorities in admissions hiring tenure contracting and financial aid. But only recently has the University been forced to rethink these policies in the face of an emerging public debate over affirmative action. We are beginning to see why. Originally conceived as a means to redress discrimination racial preferences have instead promoted it. And rather than fostering harmony and integration preferences have divided the campus. In no other area of public life is there a greater disparity between the rhetoric of preferences and the reality. Take for instance the claim that racial preferences help the disadvantaged. In reality as the Hoover Institutions Thomas Sowell has observed preferences primarily benefit minority applicants from middle and upperclass backgrounds. At the same time because admissions are a zerosum game preferences hurt poor whites and even many Asians who meet admissions standards in disproportionate numbers. If preferences were truly meant to remedy disadvantage they would be given on the basis of disadvantage not on the basis of race. Another myth is that preferences simply give minority applicants a small plus. In reality the average SAT disparity between Stanfords AfricanAmerican and white admittees reached 171 points in 1992 according to data compiled by the Consortium on Financing Higher Education and cited in Richard herrnstein and Charles Murrays book The Bell Curve. The fundamental unfairness and arbitrariness of preferences why should the underqualified son of a black doctor displace the qualified daughter of a Vietnamese boat refugee? has led supporters to shift rationales in recent years. Instead of a remedy for disadvantage many supporters now claim that preferences promote diversity. This same push for diversity also has led Stanford to create racially segregated dormitories racially segregated freshman orientation programs racially segregated graduation ceremonies and curricular requirements in race theory and gender studies. But if diversity were really the goal then preferences would be given on the basis of unusual characteristics not on the basis of race. The underlying assumption that only minorities can add certain ideas or perspectives is offensive not merely because it is untrue but also because it implies that all minorities think a certain way. If after 25 years affirmative action has not succeeded in ending discrimination perhaps it is time to try something else. Whats gone wrong? The basic problem is that a racist past cannot be undone through more racism. Raceconscious programs betray Martin Luther Kings dream of a colorblind community and the heightened racial sensitivity they cause is a source of acrimony and tension instead of healing. When University officials boast of looking for racism everywhere as multicultural educator Greg Ricks did in a 1990 Stanford Daily interview then perhaps the most sensible and certainly the most predictable response will be for white students to avoid dealing with such quarrelsome people. In this way the stress on diversity has made interracial interaction strained and superficial multiculturalism has caused political correctness. None of this is to deny that there are some people in America who are racist and that there are some features of American life that are legacies of a much more racist past. But racism is not everywhere and there is very little at a place like Stanford. Certainly no one has accused Stanfords admissions officers of being racist so perhaps the real problem with affirmative action is that we are pretending to solve a problem that no longer exists. Moreover there is a growing sense that if affirmative action has not succeeded in ending discrimination after 25 years of determined implementation then perhaps it is time to try something else. Although Stanfords admissions office cannot undo the wrongs of history its mission is still very important namely admitting the best class of students it can find. The sole criterion in finding the members of this class and in defining merit should be individual achievement not just grades and test scores of course but a broad range of accomplishments in athletics music student government drama school clubs and other extracurricular efforts. But race and ethnicity or gender or sexual preference do not have a place on this list these are traits not achievements. Perhaps the most tragic side effect of affirmative action is that very significant achievements of minority students can become compromised. It is often not possible to tell whether a given student genuinely deserved admission to Stanford or whether he is there by virtue of fitting into some sort of diversity matrix. When people do start to suspect the worst that preferences have skewed the entire class they are accused of the very racism that justifies these preferences. It is a strange cure that generates its own disease. A Stanford without affirmative action will be a Stanford in which the question of who belongs here will no longer need to be answered. It will no longer need to be answered because it will no longer need to be asked not even sotto voce. David Sacks 94 is a law student at the University of Chicago. Peter Thiel 89 JD 92 runs an investment firm. They are coauthors of The Diversity Myth Multiculturalism and the Politics of Intolerance at Stanford.   Universities must cultivate a climate in which students feel comfortable taking intellectual risks. Four faculty members weigh in on why setting that culture is hard. We live in a world where one person s disinformation is another person s truth. But the university s free exchange of ideas can sharpen the picture.  Frances C.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/07/02/affirmative-action-supreme-court-civil-rights-law/, The Supreme Court was considering Regents of the University of California v. Bakke its first major case about affirmative action in university admissions. Both parties in the case had asked for a ruling on whether the 14th Amendment to the Constitution with its guarantee of equal protection to all people allowed universities to take applicants race into account. Stevens argued that the court did not need to answer that question to decide the case. Our settled practice he wrote is to avoid the decision of a constitutional issue if a case can be fairly decided on a statutory ground. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 provided just such a statutory ground It forbids any institution receiving federal money from subjecting any person to discrimination based on race. It does not say that such discrimination may be allowed to rectify the effects of past discrimination or to construct demographically representative student bodies or to secure educational benefits from racial diversity. It flatly prohibits it. That s what the court should have said 45 years ago and what it should have said this year too. But Stevens did not prevail. In Bakke five justices wriggled free of the text of law. The statute they claimed in two separate opinions was an attempt to vindicate the 14th Amendment and it was up to the justices to say what the amendment s guarantee of equality means. If they decided the amendment allows discrimination for supposedly benign purposes then that s what the statute allows too. George F. Will The court did not end affirmative action. This was just a skirmish. Ever since then arguments in court about affirmative action have continued to dwell on the Constitution rather than on the law Congress enacted. Stevens himself silently abandoned his initial opinion. The court s new decision on affirmative action is also based on the Constitution. Six justices voted to hold that Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill violated the equal protection clause. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. writing for the majority declined to separate the statutory and constitutional questions that Bakke fused. The dissenters are committed to the view that both the statute and the Constitution allow raceconscious admissions. Justice Neil M. Gorsuch s opinion comes closest to resurrecting the old Stevens argument. The Civil Rights Act has independent force he argues and forbids a thumb on the scale for any applicant based on race. But Gorsuch joined the majority s constitutional holding too. Patient readers might be wondering what difference it would have made if the justices had made a statutory ruling against the universities rather than a constitutional one. Either way they would have had to adopt raceneutral admissions. The statutory option would however have had two advantages. First it would have been more persuasive. The case that the Civil Rights Act bars discrimination based on race is openandshut. The case that the equal protection clause with its more generalized phrasing forbids it especially when practiced by a private institution such as Harvard is trickier. Justice Clarence Thomas tries to establish the point with an originalist argument that seems to me only partially successful and won the endorsement of no other justice. Second it would have been a humbler and more democratic decision. If the court ruled that Congress had outlawed university affirmative action programs it would have left open the question whether Congress could reconsider that policy. Supporters of affirmative action would have had a legislative outlet for their concerns rather than being told that they would have to amend the Constitution or change the lineup of justices to get the policy they want. Many polls show that racebased admissions are unpopular so any such revision of the Civil Rights Act would be uphill sledding. The court might then never have had to decide whether Congress could embrace raceconscious admissions. In that scenario it would have been clear that the problem for advocates of such policies is their inability to build a political consensus rather than the obstruction of the justices. Only two cheers for the court s conservative majority then which has reached the right result via the wrong reasoning.

The US Supreme Court has struck down raceconscious admissions policies at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina effectively banning affirmative action on college campuses nationwide. The muchanticipated decision came down on Thursday June 29. Last Octoberthe US Supreme Court heard two cases filed by the Students For Fair Admissions SFFA organization both challenging the lawfulness of affirmative action at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. Affirmative action aims to address racial discrimination by recognizing and responding to the structural barriers that have denied underrepresented students access to higher education and has been an integral part of many US college and university admissions policies since the 1960s and 70s.  The SFFA argued that the 14th Amendment s Equal Rights Provision makes raceconscious admissions policies illegal. The Court sided with the SFFA in a 63 vote against UNC and a 62 vote against Harvard.   The entire point of the Equal Protection Clause is that treating someone differently because of their skin color is not like treating them differently because they are from a city or from a suburb or because they play the violin poorly or well wrote conservative Chief Justice John Roberts in the Court s majority opinion.That means race may never be used as a negative and that it may not operate as a stereotype Our cases have stressed that an individual s race may never be used against him in the admissions process.  In a sharp dissent liberal Justice Sonia Sotomayor stated Today this court overrules decades of precedent and imposes a superficial rule of race blindness on the Nation. The devastating impact of this decision cannot be overstated. The majority s vision of race neutrality will entrench racial segregation in higher education because racial inequality will persist so long as it is ignored.  NYU News spoke with Professor of Clinical Law and American Civil Liberties Union President Deborah Archer about the history of affirmative action and how higher education institutions can continue to strive for diversity. Deborah Archer What was your reaction to the phrasing of the majority opinion? I think the court got it all wrong. They misstate and distort how affirmative action works and the current reality of racism. Justice Roberts said eliminating racial discrimination means eliminating all of it. But it is racial discrimination that makes affirmative action programs necessary. Affirmative action and race conscious admissions policies helped address our country s long history of racial discrimination and systemic racial inequality by increasing access to higher education for underrepresented racial and ethnic groups who face systemic barriers and admissions criteria that capture and magnify racial bias. The Court s decision is a devastating blow to efforts to expand access to higher education to increasing access to opportunity and to preparing future generations to learn challenge and build across the differences that have divided this country since its beginning. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson spoke powerfully about this in her dissent. Those racial divisions systematically lock students of color out of opportunities not only in higher education but also in elementary and secondary education housing employment and more which all impact their access to the resources and opportunities that could increase their access to higher education. Those divisions still exist yet the Supreme Court has adopted this view that affirmative action is no longer needed because America has moved beyond racist policies of the past. We haven t the tools may have evolved but the racially exclusionary impact remains. Justice Sonia Sotomayors dissent asserted that the Supreme Courts decision stands in the way and rolls back decades of precedent and momentous progress and cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter. How might Sotomayors dissent and those of the other two liberal judges Ketanji Brown Jackson and Elena Kagan be used in future advocacy attempts? Pushing us into this colorblind paradigm is going to do real damage and set us back in a world that is undeniably shaped by race. Ignoring race does not make the reality of racial inequality go away. Race continues to constrain opportunities and life outcomes for some and expand opportunities and outcomes for others. Color blindness will only make that worse. It will only exacerbate racial injustice and delay the vital work of grappling with the way race shapes access to opportunities. Ignoring race does not make racism go away. Justice Sotomayor talked about the meaning of the 14th Amendment. The purpose of the 14th Amendment was not to ignore race in decision making. It was not to end raceconsciousness. It was to end oppression. It was to end the political economic and social subjugation of people on the basis of their race. That is the goal of affirmative action. I hope that future advocacy efforts can help to reclaim the 14th Amendment as a tool for racial equity. How was affirmative action previously implemented in college admissions processes? Over the past 45 years the US Supreme Court has repeatedly held that raceconscious admissions programs are constitutional with substantial benefits that flow to individual students the educational institution and the larger society. The law which has been clarified in Bakke two cases against the University of Michigan and two cases against the University of Texas says that race can be one factor among many in a holistic admissions program provided that it is narrowly tailored and there is no raceneutral alternative that would achieve the same results. This is how affirmative action is implemented today and how it is implemented at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.  In some states they also use top10 percent plans as part of their efforts to achieve a diverse class. With top10 percent plans high school students who graduate in the top 10 percent of their graduating class are guaranteed admission to the state s public university. North Carolina is one of those states and its plan was at issue in the lawsuit against UNCChapel Hill.  What do you consider the biggest misconception about affirmative action? One widespread misconception is that affirmative action is a preference. Affirmative action programs do not give a preference to any student because of their race. Preference is a loaded term and not an accurate one. The law is clear that admissions programs cannot give automatic preferences or points or reserve spots for applicants of certain races. Another misconception is that affirmative action is an exception to a meritbased system. Raceconscious admissions programs are still meritbased admissions programs. Holistic review encourages admissions officers to look beyond conventional credentials and also consider context for the credentials and achievements.  Our underlying admissions practices are far from meritocratic. Many of the measures are better predictors of access to wealth than a student s potential. And many students are admitted because they are the children of donors alums or faculty members. Moreover racial inequality in K12 schools feeds the racial inequality we see in higher education. Most K12 schools are racially identifiable and those racially identifiable schools do not have equal access to the resources and opportunities that are traditionally valued in the admissions process.  How could banning raceconscious admissions policies for universities impact similar diversity efforts in the workplace? This decision should be limited to higher education admissions. Corporations and other organizations should not read something into the decision that is not there. However affirmative action is ground zero in a larger fight around racial justice. It is one step in a much larger effort to impose a colorblind framework on all of society and to make it impossible for public policy to address the deep and profound racial inequality. Colorblindness is the antithesis of diversity and it exacerbates racial injustice by preventing all of us from grappling with the ways race shapes our lives experiences and opportunities.  Has the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action before? Yes the Court has ruled on this issue many times over the past 45 years. But these cases raise some new issues. First previous cases were brought against public institutions using the Equal Protection Clause of the US Constitution. Here they are suing Harvard a private institution using Title VI of the Civil Rights Act.  These cases are also different in the remedy they seek. They are not just asking that race not be a consideration in the admissions process they have requested that conduct all admissions in a manner that does not permit those engaged in the process to be aware of or learn the race or ethnicity of any applicant for admission. And yes that means just what you think it means. This would require applicants to erase any trace of their race or ethnicity from their application for admissions. It would prevent an applicant of color from fully expressing their identity and in particular those parts of their identity inextricably bound to their race. Are there other avenues for universities to strive for diversity postaffirmative action? Nine states have prohibited the use of race and other protected characteristics in various settings including university and college admissions. What institutions in those states have done is helpful and instructive in understanding what avenues could remain available to support diversity in higher education. Those efforts have included Evaluating academic achievement in context giving credit to students who have attended underserved and underrepresented schools considering socioeconomic status and English language learner status considering group or community demographics and expanded outreach and recruitment efforts.
