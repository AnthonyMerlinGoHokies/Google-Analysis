https://www.sanders.senate.gov/press-releases/news-sanders-introduces-legislation-to-ensure-corporations-finally-pay-their-fair-share-in-taxes/, WASHINGTON April 10 As millions of Americans prepare to file their taxes ahead of the federal deadline on April 15 Sen. Bernie Sanders IVt. today introduced legislation to ensure that large corporations are finally required to pay their fair share. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would stop corporations from sheltering profits in tax havens like the Cayman Islands and Luxembourg eliminate tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas and close loopholes in the tax code that allow corporations to get away with paying little to nothing in taxes. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation closing corporate use of offshore tax havens would raise more than 1 trillion in revenue over 10 years. This legislation would also roll back the Trump corporate tax rate cut and restore the top rate to 35 percent a move that would raise an additional 1.3 trillion over 10 years. Sanders is joined by Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky DIll. who has companion legislation in the House.  At a time of massive wealth and income inequality and soaring corporate profits it is an outrage that many large profitable corporations continue to pay little to nothing in federal income taxes said Sanders. As working people struggle to pay rent and put food on the table we have a corrupt and rigged tax code that is designed to benefit the wealthy and the powerful at the expense of working families. Meanwhile Republicans would make a bad situation even worse by providing even more tax breaks to their corporate campaign contributors and the billionaire class while proposing massive cuts to Social Security Medicare and Medicaid. That is unacceptable. We need to create an economy and a government that works for all of us not just the top one percent. And one of the ways we can begin to do that is by making sure that large corporations pay their fair share of taxes. American workers should not be paying more in federal income taxes in a given year than profitable companies like Target Amazon and TMobile.   We live in the richest country in the world at the richest moment in history yet many Americans are unable to feel the magnitude of our wealth. One of the biggest problems we face is income inequality. As big corporations continue to rake in record profits there are many families struggling to put food on the table said Schakowsky. Thanks to President Joe Biden we are growing the economy from the bottom up and the middle out but we must go even further by passing the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act to help put the interests of everyday Americans ahead of billionaires and transnational corporations. I thank Senator Sanders for devoting his career to tackling income inequality and am proud to partner with him on this important measure.  Despite record breaking profits many of the largest and most profitable corporations in the United States continue to pay little to nothing in taxes. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would build on the important progress made by the Inflation Reduction Act in reversing corporate tax breaks which included a 15 percent minimum tax on large corporations that will raise 222 billion over the next 10 years. Sanders legislation would go well beyond this by entirely shutting down offshore tax avoidance and restoring the top corporate tax rate to 35 percent where it was before Trump became president. Together these policies will raise more than 2.3 trillion over the next 10 years. According to a study from the Government Accountability Office GAO 34 percent of large profitable corporations paid nothing in federal income taxes during the first year that the Trump tax cuts went into effect. Overall the study found that large profitable American corporations on average paid less than 9 percent of their profits in federal income taxes in 2018. Another study found that 109 large profitable corporations paid zero federal income tax in at least one of the last five years. For example any American worker who paid a single dollar in income taxes paid more than the below companies paid in corporate incomes taxes How do companies get away with paying little to nothing in taxes? The biggest loophole in the corporate tax code is the one allowing corporations to pay a lower or even zero percent tax rate on profits stashed in tax havens. This loophole explains why American corporations report 59 percent of their offshore profits in tax havens and the absurd situation where one fivestory office building in the Cayman Islands is home to about 20000 corporations. The collapse in corporate revenue is notable both in the U.S. and internationally. The corporate tax used to represent about 30 percent of total revenues to the federal government in the 1950s but that number is now down to just 9 percent in 2023. Similarly U.S. corporate tax revenue as a percentage of the economy is one of the lowest among major economies and half the level of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries OECD average. This would change under the Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act. In addition to putting an end to offshore tax havens and tax breaks for companies that ship jobs and factories overseas this legislation would reform the tax code by The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act has been endorsed by Americans for Tax Fairness ATF a coalition of more than 420 national state and local organizations.  The global tax system has long allowed corporations to avoid paying their full amount in domestic taxes by shifting their profits overseas to tax havens like the Cayman Islands and Bermuda said David Kass Executive Director for Americans for Tax Fairness. The Corporate Tax Dodging Prevention Act would remove incentives for offshoring of American factories and jobs by equalizing the tax rates between foreign and domestic profits and make corporations pay their fair share of taxes.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/04/07/top-tax-frustrations-for-americans-the-feeling-that-some-corporations-wealthy-people-dont-pay-fair-share/, About sixinten adults now say that the feeling that some corporations don t pay their fair share 61 bothers them a lot while a nearly identical share say this about some wealthy people not paying their fair share 60 according to a Pew Research Center survey of 5079 U.S. adults conducted from March 27 to April 2 2023. These percentages are essentially unchanged since 2021. About half of Americans 53 now say the complexity of the federal tax system bothers them a lot up from 47 who said this in 2021. About a third 32 say the tax system s complexity bothers them some while 13 say it bothers them not much or not at all. Ahead of Tax Day this year Pew Research Center conducted this survey to assess the public s attitudes about the federal tax system paying taxes and possible changes to tax rates. For this analysis we surveyed 5079 adults from March 27 to April 2 2023. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for the analysis and its methodology. Roughly fourinten adults 38 are bothered a lot by the amount they personally pay in taxes today a modest increase from two years ago when 33 said this. A third today say the amount they pay bothers them some while 29 say it doesn t bother them much or at all. Only about oneinten Americans are bothered a lot 13 by a sense that lowerincome people don t pay their fair share to the federal treasury. An additional 21 are somewhat bothered by this while most Americans say this bothers them not too much 28 or not at all 36. Republicans and Democrats including those who lean toward each party diverge in their frustrations with the federal tax system. Democrats and Democratic leaners overwhelmingly say they are bothered a lot by the feeling that corporations and wealthy people do not pay their fair shares 77 say this for each. By comparison fewer than half of Republicans and Republican leaners share those views 46 say this about corporations and 43 about the wealthy. Republicans express their highest levels of frustration with the complexity of the tax system 59 say this bothers them a lot compared with 49 of Democrats. Republicans are also more likely than Democrats to say the amount they pay in taxes bothers them a lot 44 vs. 31. Few in either party say the feeling that some people with lower incomes don t pay their fair share bothers them though Republicans are more than twice as likely as Democrats to say this 19 vs. 8. Today 56 of Americans say that the amount they pay in taxes is more than their fair share given what they get from the federal government up from 49 in 2021. Roughly a third 34 now say they pay about the right amount in taxes while 8 say they pay less than their fair share. Republicans are more likely than Democrats 63 vs. 50 to say they pay more than their fair share to the federal government but these percentages have increased in both parties over the last two years. The share of Republicans saying they pay more than their fair share has increased by four percentage points since 2021 among Democrats it has increased by nine points. Americans from upper and middleincome households conservative Republicans and those ages 30 to 64 are especially likely to say they pay more than their fair share in taxes to the federal government. Sixinten adults ages 30 to 64 say their personal tax burden is too high while smaller shares of those ages 18 to 29 and those 65 and older say the same 53 and 48 respectively. Upperincome 62 and middleincome 60 Americans are more likely than those with lower household incomes 47 to feel their tax burden is unfair given what they receive from the federal government. Refer to the methodology for details on how household income tiers are determined. While Republicans overall are more likely than Democrats to say they pay more than their fair share to the federal government conservatives in the GOP are particularly likely to say this. About twothirds of conservative Republicans 68 say they pay an unfair amount compared with 55 of moderate and liberal Republicans. Among Democrats there is no significant ideological gap in views of personal tax burdens 52 of conservative and moderate Democrats say they pay an unfair share as do 47 of liberal Democrats. Republicans with higher household incomes are especially likely to be critical of the taxes they pay. About threequarters of upperincome Republicans 76 say they pay more than their fair share while twothirds of middleincome Republicans 66 and about half of lowerincome Republicans 48 say the same. By comparison about half of Democrats across income tiers say they pay more than their fair share. As a result the partisan divide in views of one s personal tax burden is particularly pronounced among upperincome Americans. About half of Democrats with high family incomes 47 say they pay an unfair share in taxes almost 30 percentage points lower than the share of Republicans in the same income bracket who say this 76. In contrast nearly identical shares of lowerincome Democrats 45 and Republicans 48 say they pay too much. About sixinten Americans 61 favor raising tax rates for households that make more than 400000 including a quarter who say these tax rates should be raised a lot and 36 who say they should be raised a little. Another 20 say tax rates for this group should be kept the same as they are now while a similar share 17 say taxes should be lowered for these households. These views are little changed in recent years. Democrats especially liberal Democrats overwhelmingly favor raising tax rates for highincome households. About threequarters of Democrats 77 say tax rates should be raised for those with incomes above 400000. That share jumps to 86 among liberal Democrats including 47 who want rates to be raised a lot. A smaller majority of conservative and moderate Democrats 68 want rates raised on these households. Republicans are less likely than Democrats to say tax rates should be raised for those with incomes over 400000 but more Republicans support raising rates for these high incomes 46 than say rates should be kept the same 29 or lowered 24. Moderate and liberal Republicans 56 are more likely than conservative Republicans 39 to say taxes should be raised on these incomes. Majorities of upperincome 56 middleincome 63 and lowerincome 61 Americans say tax rates should be raised on household incomes over 400000. However within both parties support for raising taxes on high earners varies by household income. Upperincome Republicans are the least supportive of raising tax rates for those with incomes over 400000. About a third 35 say this compared with 48 of middleincome Republicans and 53 of lowerincome Republicans. Among Democrats those in lowerincome households are less supportive than those with middle and upper incomes of raising rates for incomes over 400000. About twothirds of lowerincome Democrats say these taxes should go up while about eightinten middleincome 82 and upperincome 80 Democrats say the same. A majority of Americans 65 say that tax rates on large businesses and corporations should be raised a lot 39 or a little 26. About twointen 19 say large businesses tax rates should be kept about the same while 14 say their taxes should be lowered a little 8 or a lot 6. There are deep partisan divisions over raising tax rates for large businesses 85 of Democrats say these rates should be raised at least a little compared with 45 of Republicans. Among Republicans moderates and liberals are more supportive of raising taxes for large businesses and corporations 58 favor raising them a lot or a little than conservatives. Conservative Republicans views are almost equally divided between raising corporate taxes 37 lowering them 30 and keeping them about the same 30. Among Democrats large majorities of both liberals 93 and conservatives or moderates 78 say that large businesses and corporations should have higher tax rates. However while threequarters of liberal Democrats favor raising large businesses taxes a lot a smaller share 44 of conservative and moderate Democrats say the same. When it comes to household income Americans views of raising tax rates on large businesses and corporations are similar to the patterns observed in their attitudes toward raising taxes on incomes over 400000. Among Democrats those with lower household incomes are less supportive than those in higher income groups of raising large businesses taxes while among Republicans those with lower incomes are more supportive of higher corporate tax rates than those with middle or upper incomes.

https://www.nber.org/reporter/2023number3/how-do-corporate-taxes-affect-economic-activity, Local and state policymakers compete to attract companies to their jurisdictions. Proponents of using business tax cuts as incentives for firm location argue that increases in job creation justify losses in revenue while detractors argue that incentives have little economic impact and mostly benefit firm owners. Our research provides new empirical evidence of the effects of corporate taxes on local economic outcomes and develops a new framework to quantify the incidence of business tax cuts and the distribution of the benefit of such cuts among firm owners land owners and workers.1 Corporate taxes in an open economy are conventionally thought to reduce both efficiency and equity they distort the location and scale of economic activity and ultimately fall on workers via lower wages. Previous models of corporate taxation and spatial equilibrium have limitations for addressing this issue. Models of corporate taxation usually assume that firms earn zero profits which implies that firm owners cannot benefit from business tax cuts. On the other hand models of spatial equilibrium assume a single firm in each location which obviates a meaningful role for firm location incentives. We develop a spatial equilibrium model with imperfectly mobile firms and workers. Firm owners may earn profits and may be inframarginal in their location choices due to differences in locationspecific productivities. This modeling innovation allows the analysis of the effects of tax incentives to attract firms to be informed by data. We find that tax cuts are associated with an increase in the number of local firms. Moreover as firms locate in areas with lower taxes there is an increase in employment wages and rents. We use the evidence on these responses to tax changes to estimate who benefits from tax cuts. We find that firm owners bear a substantial portion of incidence. This implies that while business tax cuts may grow the local economy most of the benefits of the tax cut accrue to relatively wealthy firm owners.2 In contrast the burden of higher sales taxes which are often used to counterbalance the reduction in revenue from business tax cuts falls disproportionately on lowerincome workers. Our most recent work presents new theoretical and empirical results.3 First we enhance the empirical analysis of the effects of state business taxes using new data from the US Census Bureau s Longitudinal Business Database and Annual Survey of Manufactures. We provide new evidence that business tax cuts increase the local labor demand of incumbent firms and lead to the entry of relatively less productive firms. Second we show that these new reducedform effects identify the benefits to firm owners from state corporate tax cuts. We update our modeling approach to estimate profit effects and to account for the effects of taxes on the composition of firms and the cost of capital thereby allowing for more flexible responses of the local cost of capital to changes in business taxes.4 Finally we show how to derive income shares for each of the agents of the model and compute incomeshareweighted incidence estimates. Our central finding is that firm owners receive roughly half of the benefit of a corporate tax cut while workers and landowners receive 35 40 percent and 10 15 percent respectively. While states compete for businesses by lowering tax rates they also attract them by providing tax credits and generous deductions. We reassess the state corporate tax structure tax rates and tax base rules and document how it has changed over time.5 The average statelevel corporate tax rate has remained relatively stable over the last three decades while the ratio of corporate tax revenue to state GDP has generally decreased. Changes in tax base rules such as loss carry forward provisions and investment tax credits explain more of the variation in the ratio of state corporate tax revenue to GDP than do changes in state corporate tax rates. These rules account for 60 to 90 percent of the explained variation in corporate tax revenues and the trend toward narrower state corporate tax bases helps explain the reduction in corporate tax revenues as a share of GDP. This shows that relatively obscure changes in tax policy may be more important for state finances than welldebated changes in state tax rates. Overall we find that changes in the structure of the corporate tax system have been favorable for corporations and have reduced the extent to which tax rate increases raise corporate tax revenue. In addition to tax rates and tax base rules business tax incentives are also relied upon by states to attract and retain companies. Cailin Slattery and Zidar characterize these firm incentive policies describe the selection process that determines which places and firms give and receive incentives and evaluate their economic consequences.6 In 2014 states spent between 5 and 216 per capita on incentives for firms in the form of firmspecific subsidies and general tax credits. These mostly targeted investment job creation and research and development R D. Collectively these incentives amounted to nearly 40 percent of state corporate tax revenues on average but in some states incentive spending exceeded corporate tax revenues. States with higher per capita incentives tended to have higher state corporate tax rates. Recipients of firmspecific incentives were usually large establishments in manufacturing technology and highskilled service industries. The average discretionary subsidy cost 160 million in return for 1500 promised jobs. Firms tend to accept subsidy deals from places that are richer larger and more urban than the average county while poor places provide larger incentives and spend more per job. While the study yields some evidence of direct employment gains from attracting a firm it does not find strong evidence that firmspecific tax incentives increased broader economic growth at the state and local levels. Although incentives are often intended to attract and retain highspillover firms the evidence on spillovers and productivity effects of incentives is mixed. Ethan Rouen Suresh Nallareddy and Su rez Serrato use regression and matching techniques to study the effects of corporate tax cuts on income inequality.7 They find that state corporate tax cuts lead to increases in the share of income accruing to the top 1 percent of tax filers. Specifically a 1 percentage point pp state corporate tax cut increases the share of income to the top 1 percent of the income distribution by 1.5 pp. Since the share of income accruing to the top 1 percent increased by 6.1 pp between 1990 and 2010 this implies that the average tax rate cut of 0.5 pp was responsible for 12.4 percent of this overall increase in the top income share. This result corroborates the findings that landowners and business owners gain the most from business tax cuts. Analyzing the regional effects of changes in spending and taxes allows us to use policy changes as plausibly exogenous natural experiments to measure the effects of fiscal policy on economic activity. A drawback of this approach is that reducedform regional analyses are not able to measure the aggregate consequences of policy changes. In work with Pablo Fajgelbaum and Eduardo Morales we quantify the nationwide effects of fundamental tax reform across states by combining the insights from our work on corporate taxation in spatial equilibrium models with a quantitative model of trade between states.8 One insight is that when firms choose a location they trade off higher productivity which is partly location specific with lower taxes and production costs. Thus a location that lowers its taxes attracts more firms that were on the margin more productive elsewhere. While the local increase in jobs may benefit the local population the aggregate consequences may be negative on net as overall productivity and employment may decrease. We explore this issue by studying whether the wide variation in taxes across states generates spatial misallocation in the United States. We build a spatial generalequilibrium framework that incorporates salient features of the US state tax system. It allows us to compute nationallevel effects of reforms that limit crossstate competition in business taxation as well as to simulate the effects of specific aspects of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 TCJA. Our model includes the amenity value of public services. This allows us to compute the effects of tax reform on worker welfare accounting for the fact that some states may be underproviding public goods due to crossstate tax competition. We use changes in state tax rates between 1980 and 2010 to estimate the model parameters that determine how worker and firmlocation decisions respond to changes in state taxes and government spending. We find that state differences in tax rates generate spatial misallocation which leads to aggregate losses in GDP and welfare. Specifically worker welfare increases by 0.6 percent when we simulate the effects of harmonizing taxes across states while holding spending constant. The gains to workers are twice as large when government spending responds endogenously to the changes in taxes. Panel A in Figure 1 shows how the gains in GDP are distributed across states. While there is considerable variation in effects states that experience large increases in government spending such as Texas Florida Nevada and New Hampshire experience the largest gains from harmonization. Panel B shows that most of the gains from tax harmonization can be achieved by harmonizing state taxes within census regions. In addition to studying the effects of tax harmonization we simulate the effects of the limit on the state and local tax SALT deduction that was enacted as part of the TCJA. Prior to the TCJA taxes paid to state and local governments were deductible from federal income taxes. This policy effectively subsidized taxes in states with higher tax rates but it also reduced the dispersion in net tax rates across states. We find that removing the SALT deduction nearly doubles the standard deviation in average effective personal income tax rates across states. This increase in tax dispersion lowers welfare by 0.75 percent. Policymakers in the US and elsewhere often use tax incentives to stimulate the economy. While many of these incentives target corporate investment policymakers often advocate for them by arguing that the additional investment will create jobs and raise wages for workers. In contrast detractors of these policies argue that by lowering the cost of laborsaving machines tax incentives for investment may accelerate the pace of automation. We have studied whether incentives for capital investment stimulate the labor force lead to productivity growth or lead to the substitution of workers with machines. To identify the effects of changes in capital investment we analyze the effects of a policy called bonus depreciation which lowers the tax cost of investment by allowing companies to claim an additional tax deduction in the year that equipment investments are made. Bonus depreciation policies which have been in place in the US for most years since 2001 were significantly expanded as part of the TCJA and have been adopted by other countries including China Germany and the United Kingdom. In work with Dan Garrett and Eric Ohrn Su rez Serrato studies the local labor market effects of bonus depreciation.9 While bonus depreciation applies to all corporations in the US firms in industries that rely on assets with longer depreciation schedules benefit most from the policy. The effects of the policy can be identified by studying local labor markets with greater exposure to the industries that benefit the most from it. Figure 2 plots the results of an eventstudy analysis showing that the introduction of the policy in 2001 led to significant employment growth in locations with greater exposure to bonus depreciation. Increasing a location s exposure to bonus depreciation from the 25th to the 75th percentile of the distribution increased employment by 2.1 percent on average over the sample period. The estimates suggest that every job created by this policy cost taxpayers between 20000 and 50000. On the other hand Figure 2 also shows that these employment increases were not accompanied by increases in the average earnings of workers. A benefit of studying the local labor market effects of tax policies is that these estimates capture spillover effects of capital investment on the local economy. However this benefit comes at the cost of not being able to directly estimate how individual plants substitute between capital and labor or whether the policy leads to additional productivity growth. A related study by Mark Curtis Kevin Roberts Garrett Ohrn and Su rez Serrato examines how US manufacturing plants responded to this tax policy.10 It analyzes confidential plantlevel data from the Census Bureau. To measure the effects of the policy the study compares plants that had more to gain from the policy to those that would benefit less relying on industrylevel tabulations from Eric Zwick and James Mahon.11 The data show that plants that could benefit the most from bonus depreciation saw sustained relative increases in capital investment and in capital stocks. Relative to other firmlevel datasets such as financial statements data or tax data the data from the Census Bureau provide insight into manufacturing plants response to tax policy. Plants that increase their capital use also have large increases in employment. Interestingly the employment increases are concentrated among production workers who are more likely to operate new machines. Using more aggregate data the research also shows that bonus depreciation led to larger employment increases for workers in demographic groups that have been historically excluded from the manufacturing sector Black Hispanic female and lesseducated workers see larger employment increases because of the policy. These employment gains raise the question of whether policies that incentivize capital investment can also increase worker pay. In the case of bonus depreciation capital accumulation was not accompanied by gains in total factor productivity at the plant level or by increases in the average earnings of workers at the plants that could benefit the most from the policy. These findings bear on the question of whether tax incentives for capital investment benefit workers or lead to automation. The finding of employment increases suggests that the worst fears about policydriven automation did not materialize. At the same time increased capital accumulation did not translate into productivity or wage growth. While wages did not increase on average the results show that the policy helped workers from traditionally underrepresented groups gain a foothold in the manufacturing industry historically a pathway to the middle class. While the research described above focuses on the US economy research by business tax scholars on other leading economies has also made inroads. A particularly interesting case study is that of China which has long spent more in capital investment than the US and which is also increasing its emphasis on innovation and R D. In a series of coauthored papers Su rez Serrato has studied the structure of business taxation in China12 how Chinese firms respond to tax incentives for R D investment13 and how tax policies interact with other investment frictions.14 Research on business taxation in China can improve our understanding of policies used to stimulate the economy and to transition from a productionbased to a knowledgebased economy. International taxation is also a fertile area for business taxation research. A key concern in this literature is that multinational corporations shift profits to lowtax countries at the expense of domestic taxpayers. Some of our recent work uses tax data to document the prevalence of advanced tax planning structures among US multinationals15 and to examine whether policies meant to limit profit shifting can be circumvented by multinational corporations.16 Ongoing research also studies the domestic employment effects of policies that either facilitate profit shifting17 or that aim to limit the use of tax havens by US multinationals.18 This research focus is particularly timely given that international corporate taxation is in a period of flux with the introduction of global minimum taxes and increased interest in new approaches for cooperation. We are currently exploring the effects of recent reforms on the investment behavior of US multinationals.19  Who Benefits from State Corporate Tax Cuts?

While raising the corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 percent will likely be heavily debated among policymakers in the coming weeks a new Morning ConsultPolitico poll finds that voters are mostly fine with increasing taxes on corporations to fund infrastructure improvements.  Sixtyfive percent of registered voters said they strongly or somewhat support funding Biden s infrastructure plan through 15 years of higher taxes on corporations while 21 percent somewhat or strongly oppose it  While the new poll doesn t mention a specific level of taxation the concept of raising taxes on corporations to fund Biden s infrastructure plan is overwhelmingly backed by Democratic voters with 85 percent support. Just 4 percent of Democrats said they oppose the tax hike. Republican voters were nearly split 42 percent back the president s plan to raise corporate taxes while 47 percent oppose it. Independents were much more likely to support funding the infrastructure plan through corporate tax hikes 60 percent than not 21 percent. When voters were presented with the choice between making improvements to America s infrastructure funded through increases to the corporate tax or improving infrastructure only if it were done without the tax increases 53 percent backed the former option.  Julia Kagan Senior Editor of Investopedia.com in a Feb. 6 2021 article Corporate Tax available at investopedia.com stated   A corporate tax is a tax on the profits of a corporation. The taxes are paid on a company s taxable income which includes revenue minus cost of goods sold COGS general and administrative G A expenses selling and marketing research and development depreciation and other operating costs. Corporate tax rates vary widely by country with some countries considered to be tax havens due to their low rates. Corporate taxes can be lowered by various deductions government subsidies and tax loopholes and so the effective corporate tax rate the rate a corporation actually pays is usually lower than the statutory rate the stated rate before any deductions  The federal corporate tax rate in the United States is currently a flat 21 as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA which President Donald Trump signed into law in 2017 and which went into effect in 2018. Previously the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate was 35.  The Groundwork Collaborative in an Apr. 2021 report Progressive Policies Are Good for the Economy Raise Corporate Taxes available at groundworkcollaborative.org stated  Low taxes on the wealthy and corporations contribute directly to our weak and precarious economy by magnifying inequality concentrating economic resources and power undermining democracy and suppressing consumer demand. 50 years of failed trickledown tax policy has left the United States with insufficient revenues anemic economic growth and skyrocketing inequality and the 2017 Trump tax bill only magnified these problems. A recent report found that 55 corporations paid 0 in federal taxes on 2020 profits. Corporations can and should pay more. Congress should act now to increase corporate tax rates close corporate loopholes and fix our broken international tax system. Doing so will not only pay for needed investments raised corporate taxes will directly counter damaging inequality rebalance power in our economy and are a critical step toward advancing racial equity and reducing racial and gender income and wealth gaps. Adequately taxing corporations can narrow racial income and wealth gaps and reduce economic inequality The majority of corporate stock owned by people in the U.S. is held by people in the top one percent and nearly 90 percent is held by the top 10 percent. Almost 90 percent of corporate equities and mutual shares are owned by white families while just one percent is owned by Black families. Furthermore corporations continue to pay less in taxes even while their profits rise. Taxing this income is tantamount to curbing the increasing power of corporations and the very wealthy predominantly white families who reap economic benefits and to narrowing income and wealth gaps along racial ethnic and economic lines.  The Biden Administration in an Aug. 19 2021 statement Fact Sheet The Build Back Better Agenda Will Provide Greater Tax Fairness for Small Businesses available at whirehouse.gov stated   The current tax system unfairly prioritizes large multinational corporations over Main Street American small businesses. Small businesses don t have access to the army of lawyers and accountants that allowed 55 profitable large corporations to avoid paying any federal corporate taxes in 2020 and they cannot shift profits into tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes like multinational corporations can. U.S. multinationals report 60 percent of their profits abroad in just seven low tax jurisdictions that combined make up less than 4 percent of global GDP. These corporations do not make money in these countries they just report it there to take a huge tax cut. In 2018 married couples making about 150000 working at their own small business paid over 20 percent of their income in federal income and selfemployment taxes. By contrast U.S. multinational corporations paid less than 10 percent in corporate income taxes on U.S. profits  President Biden has laid out a comprehensive tax reform plan to level the playing field address the concerns of small business owners and raise revenue that will help pay for new programs for Main Street. The President s plan will  Chuck Marr MBA Senior Director of Federal Tax Policy Samantha Jacoby JD Senior Tax Legal Analyst George Fenton PHD Senior Policy Analyst and Sam Washington Research Assistant all at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in a May 25 2021 article Corporate Rate Increase Would Make Taxes Fairer Help Fund Equitable Recovery available at cbpp.org stated   First raising taxes on corporations would make the tax code more progressive while helping to generate the revenue needed to help finance investments that would promote an equitable recovery Second the dramatic corporate tax cuts of 2017 provided few benefits to the economy in general and to low and middleincome households in particular Third raising corporate taxes by a modest amount will not undermine the economic recovery and in fact using those revenues to finance needed investments will help make the economy stronger and Fourth reducing the favorable tax treatment for offshore profits and investments which the 2017 law largely did not do would ensure that U.S. multinationals pay their fair share while positioning the United States as a leader in global tax negotiations.  Jeff Bezos founder and CEO of Amazon.com in an Apr. 6 2021 statement available on aboutamazon.com stated   We support the Biden Administration s focus on making bold investments in American infrastructure. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported infrastructure in the past and it s the right time to work together to make this happen. We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides both on the specifics of what s included as well as how it gets paid for we re supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate. We look forward to Congress and the Administration coming together to find the right balanced solution that maintains or enhances U.S. competitiveness.  Jason Furman PhD Economics Professor at Harvard University in a Jan. 28 2020 chapter How to Increase Growth while Raising Revenue Reforming the Corporate Tax Code included in Tackling the Tax Code Efficient and Equitable Ways to Raise Revenue available at brookings.edu stated   This chapter proposes reforms to business taxes that would address some of the challenges facing the current system. These challenges include historically low revenue collections instability distortions failure to address positive spillovers from research and development and failure to address the increased returns to corporations that derive from their monopoly power. The proposal would raise the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent require large passthrough businesses to file as C corporations and close other loopholes. In addition it would expand incentives for new investment by allowing businesses to expense all their investment costs and get a nearly 50 percent larger credit for their research and development spending. The proposal would raise the long run level of GDP by at least 5.8 percent adding at least 0.2 percentage point to annual GDP growth over the next decade. The combination of tax increases and additional growth would raise 1.1 trillion over the next decade and 1.1 percent of GDP in steadystate. The middle quintile of the income distribution would see a 3.5 percent increase in its aftertax income after taking into account the uses of the money raised. The overall gain to society in the long run would be about a 5.0 percent increase in wellbeing.  The US Department of the Treasury in an Apr. 2021 report The Made in America Tax Plan available at home.treasury.gov stated  The Made in America tax plan will increase the corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent. This increase maintains a tax rate on corporate profits which is approximately 7 percentage points below the rate that was in place from the late 1980s until 2017 and it is paired with attendant reforms designed to promote competitiveness and reward productive investments.  As noted above the United States raises less corporate tax revenue as a share of GDP than almost all of the advanced economies in the OECD. Raising the corporate income tax rate would modestly increase corporate revenues relative to GDP still leaving them below those of our trading partners. In addition to raising revenue to fund urgent fiscal priorities raising the corporate income tax rate would also help attenuate inequality. The corporate income tax is one of the most progressive taxes in our tax system. Also the corporate tax is an essential lever for taxing capital in general serving as a critical backstop to ensure that capital is taxed at least once in the absence of the corporate tax a substantial share of capital income would escape taxation altogether.  Parker Sheppard PhD Research Fellow for Dynamic Modeling and Simulations in the Center for Data Analysis at the Institute for Economic Freedom of The Heritage Foundation in an Apr. 15 2021 article The LongRun Economic Effects of Raising the Corporate Tax Rate to 28 Percent available at heritage.org stated   The proposal to raise the corporate income tax is motivated in part by a desire to pay for 2.65 trillion in spending over the 10year budget window. Many of the provisions in the American Jobs Plan such as building energyefficient housing and producing electric vehicles are things that the private sector is already doing. Providing public funding for those activities and raising corporate taxes merely produces the same goods at a higher cost. Taxes lead to market distortions and inefficiencies as households and businesses adjust to the costs that they impose. The reduction in trade benefits no one as the government cannot collect tax revenue on income that is not produced. Technically speaking the reduction in welfare from lost gains in trade is referred to as deadweight loss. Deadweight loss measures the increase in welfare that would have accrued to producers or consumers but did not happen because the gain from trade was not high enough to pay for the tax levied on it. The best policy to promote prosperity for all households in the United States is to keep taxes low and to keep spending in line with revenue.  Joshua Bolten JD Business Roundtable President and CEO as quoted by Thomas Franck in a Sep. 28 2021 article Top CEOs say they re worried about corporate tax hikes as Dems push bills aimed at boosting working families available at cnbc.com stated   Increasing taxes on America s largest job creators by almost 1 trillion nearly three times the net corporate tax cut from 2017 tax reform would be one of the largest corporate tax increases in history. Tax increases on job creators would make it harder for U.S. companies to compete and would hinder investment in America.  Caroline L. Harris JD former Vice President of Tax Policy and Economic Development and former Chief Tax Policy Counsel at the US Chamber of Commerce in a Jan. 27 2021 article The Case for Preserving a Competitive Corporate Tax Rate available at uschamber.com stated   Raising the corporate rate would derail economic recovery since higher corporate income taxes harm economic growth and ultimately hurt workers Corporate income taxes are the most harmful for economic growth. Further the burden of corporate taxes falls most heavily on workers. High corporate tax rates divert investment away from the corporate sector curtailing investment that would raise the productivity of American workers and increase those workers real wages. Studies estimate that labor likely bears about 70 of the burden of the corporate income tax. In other words raising the U.S. corporate tax rate is a bad idea at any time given its impact on growth and real wage levels. Undertaking this worldwide to globally slow growth and lower real wages is simply a bad idea on a larger scale  Raising the corporate tax rate would make our tax system less competitive. The current U.S. combined statutory corporate tax rate is 25.9 21 federal corporate income tax rate plus a 4.9 average state corporate income tax rate. This rate is still above the worldwide average combined corporate income tax rate measured across 177 jurisdictions of 23.85 and the OECD rate of 23.5. In fact raising the 21 rate to 28 would give the United States the highest combined corporate tax rate in the OECD. This is not how we want America to be 1.  Garrett Watson Senior Policy Analyst and William McBride PhD Vice President of Federal Tax and Economic Policy both of the Tax Foundation in a Feb. 24 2021 article Evaluating Proposals to Increase the Corporate Tax Rate and Levy a Minimum Tax on Corporate Book Income available at taxfoundation.org stated  An increase in the federal corporate tax rate to 28 percent from 21 would raise the U.S. federalstate combined tax rate to 32.34 percent highest in the OECD and among Group of Seven G7 countries harming U.S. economic competitiveness and increasing the cost of investment in America. We estimate that this would reduce longrun economic output by 0.8 percent eliminate 159000 jobs and reduce wages by 0.7 percent. Workers across the income scale would bear much of the tax increase. For example the bottom 20 percent of earners would on average see a 1.45 percent drop in aftertax income in the long run  Raising the U.S. corporate income tax rate would erode America s international tax competitiveness giving us the highest combined corporate tax rate in the OECD. Such a relatively high corporate tax rate would encourage profit shifting abroad and otherwise out of the U.S. corporate sector.  Adam A. Millsap PhD Senior Fellow for Economic Opportunity Issues at Stand Together and the Charles Koch Institute in an Apr. 28 2021 article Higher Corporate Taxes Affect Everyone available at forbes.com stated   There is plenty of evidence that raising corporate income taxes affects all workers by reducing wages slowing employment growth and impeding innovation. Federal corporate income tax changes are relatively rare but with 50 states there is a lot of change and variation at the state level. Rates vary from a high of 11.5 in New Jersey to a low of 2.5 in North Carolina. Economists have studied state corporate tax changes for decades and several studies over the last 15 years find that state corporate tax increase have adverse economic consequences  There is strong evidence that corporate tax increases cause worse economic outcomes at the state level. At a time when unemployment claims remain high and thousands of firms are still in survival mode it seems imprudent to raise corporate taxes at the federal or state level.  Erica York economist and Alex Muresianu Federal Policy Analyst both of the Tax Foundation in an Apr. 21 2021 article Raising the Corporate Rate to 28 Percent Reduces GDP by 720 Billion Over Ten Years available at taxfoundation.org stated   Using the Tax Foundation General Equilibrium Model we estimate the longrun impact of a 28 percent corporate income tax rate a raise from 21 would be a 0.7 percent reduction in GDP amounting to about 160 billion in today s dollars of lost output each year. Similarly the level of American incomes measured by Gross National Product GNP the capital stock wages and fulltime equivalent employment would also be lower  The 720 billion in lost GDP over 10 years slightly exceeds the estimated 694 billion of tax revenue that would be raised over 10 years after accounting for the smaller economy. For instance in year 10 the economy would be about 137 billion lower and the government would raise about 65 billion of revenue implying about 2.10 of output lost for each dollar of dynamic revenue raised or about 1.34 using conventional revenue in the 10th year  Corporate income taxes are one of the most harmful ways to raise revenue. They place a higher burden on investment reduce economic output and reduce aftertax incomes across the income spectrum negative economic effects that compound over time.

https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/videos/who-bears-burden-corporate-income-tax/, Raising the corporate income tax is often promoted as a way to generate revenue for helpful government services. Unfortunately higher corporate taxes typically hurt the very people they re supposed to help because they lead to lost wages and fewer opportunities for many workers. Imagine a business in the early 2000s considering moving part of their workforce from desktop computers to laptops. Field engineers who used pen and paper and then had to reenter data and reports on desktops back in the office were instantly more productive. Other workers gained the freedom to work from home. This boosted performance and increased job satisfaction. The company could also now hire remote workers in other cities and attract more talent. All of these gains led to greater efficiency product breakthroughs and higher revenue which in turn enabled the company to increase wages through raises bonuses and promotions and to create new jobs. Now imagine the corporate income tax is raised and the investment is no longer viable for the company. All of the productivity and innovation gains then go unrealized and workers lose out on those increased wages and opportunities. This same story would play out in different ways for all types of companies and workers throughout the economy. This is the problem with raising the corporate income tax workers may benefit from the government services they provide but they also experience real economic harm. And studies show that higher corporate taxes reduce wages most for young workers the lowskilled and women. Many in these groups already face significant barriers to working like limited transportation or high childcare costs which when coupled with lower wages can make it unaffordable to work at all. Many economists agree that the corporate income tax is one of the most harmful and least efficient ways to fund our priorities. Taxes are necessary to pay for government services. But they shouldn t come at the cost of the people who those services are supposed to help. The global economy needs policymakers who are invested in seeing growth recover and avoiding unnecessary barriers to crossborder trade and investment. The challenges countries face will become even more difficult to solve in a stagnant global economy. It s unlikely these implemented and proposed windfall taxes will achieve their goals of raising additional revenues without distorting the market. Instead they would penalize domestic production and punitively target certain industries without a sound tax base.

The President s plan delivers tax cuts for families with children and working Americans invests in America and reduces deficits by trillions of dollars by enacting a new billionaire minimum tax and cracking down on multinational companies shifting jobs and profits overseas.Since taking office President Biden has fought to build a fairer tax system that rewards work not wealth asks big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share and requires all Americans to play by the same rules and pay the taxes they owe. Despite Republican opposition President Biden secured historic legislation to make our tax code fairer from enacting a 15 corporate minimum tax so that billiondollar companies can t get away with paying 0 in federal income taxes to giving the Internal Revenue Service IRS the tools it needs to make wealthy tax cheats pay the taxes they owe.President Biden will fight to stop Republican plans to add trillions to the deficit with tax cuts skewed to big corporations and the wealthy doubling down on their failed trickledown tax cuts that already increased the nation s debt by trillions of dollars. Republicans have proposed making all of President Trump s tax cuts permanent while refusing to pay for them by increasing taxes on big corporations or the wealthy. Instead they would rather add trillions to the national debt than take back even one dollar of the 150 billion annual rate cut corporations received under President Trump. Their plan would add more than 3 trillion to deficits over 10 years while providing tax cuts worth 175000 per year to the top 0.1 percent of Americans that have incomes over 4.5 million. President Biden supports continuing tax cuts for families making less than 400000 but opposes extending tax cuts or restoring tax breaks for those making more than 400000 per year. And he believes that any extensions should be paid for by asking big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share.While big corporations and the wealthy will pay more in taxes under President Biden s policies President Biden opposes tax increases on middleclass families. He has pledged that under his Administration no one earning less than 400000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes not one penny.Making Big Corporations Pay Their Fair SharePresident Biden has secured major reforms to crack down on big corporations paying little or nothing in taxes and on stock buybacks that provide large lowtax payouts to wealthy investors and CEOs. President Biden s tax plan would build on this progress by finally making big corporations pay their fair share in taxes Making the Wealthy Pay Their Fair SharePresident Biden has already secured funding for the Internal Revenue Service IRS that is enabling it to crack down on wealthy and big business tax cheats. The IRS has used this funding to collect more than 500 million in unpaid taxes from fewer than 2000 delinquent millionaires launch enforcement action against 25000 millionaires who have not filed a tax return since 2017 and crack down on highend tax evasion like deducting personal use of corporate jets as a business expense. In total the IRS is projected to collect hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over the next decade thanks to this investment. President Biden s tax plan would build on this progress with reforms that will finally make the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share Cutting Taxes for Working Families and the Middle ClassPresident Biden s tax cuts cut child poverty in half in 2021 and are saving millions of people an average of about 800 per year in health insurance premiums today. Going forward in addition to honoring his pledge not to raise taxes on families earning less than 400000 annually President Biden s tax plan would cut taxes for middle and lowincome Americans by 765 billion over 10 years including by In addition President Biden s plan will extend all middleclass tax cuts as the President has repeatedly promised he will not raise taxes on anyone making less than 400000 per year. He will fully pay for these extensions with additional reforms to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share so that they do not add to the debt. And he opposes extending tax cuts or restoring tax breaks for those making more than 400000 per year.The Congressional Republican Plan Adding Trillions to Deficits With Tax Cuts Skewed to the Wealthy and Big CorporationsRepublicans are working to make all of former President Trump s tax cuts permanent adding more than 3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years with unpaidfor tax cuts that are skewed to the wealthy and large corporations.

https://corporatetax.procon.org/, Proponents of raising the corporate tax rate argue that corporations should pay their fair share of taxes and that those taxes will keep companies in the United States while allowing the US federal government to pay for much needed infrastructure and social programs. Opponents of raising the corporate tax rate argue that an increase will weaken the economy and that the taxes will ultimately be paid by everyday people while driving corporations overseas. Read more background  As a 2021 Biden Administration White House statement explains The current tax system unfairly prioritizes large multinational corporations over Main Street American small businesses. Small businesses don t have access to the army of lawyers and accountants that allowed 55 profitable large corporations to avoid paying any federal corporate taxes in 2020 and they cannot shift profits into tax havens to avoid paying U.S. taxes like multinational corporations can. U.S. multinationals report 60 percent of their profits abroad in just seven low tax jurisdictions that combined make up less than 4 percent of global GDP. These corporations do not make money in these countries they just report it there to take a huge tax cut. In 2018 married couples making about 150000 working at their own small business paid over 20 percent of their income in federal income and selfemployment taxes. By contrast U.S. multinational corporations paid less than 10 percent in corporate income taxes on U.S. profits. 73 Large corporations have the ability to pay more taxes without much effect. Kimberly Clausing Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax Analysis at the US Department of the Treasury stated Corporate taxes are paid only by profitable corporations and for those without profits any percent of zero is zero. Also many companies can carry forward losses to offset taxes in future years. However companies profiting in the current environment such as Amazon or Peloton can reasonably be expected to contribute a share of their pandemic profits in tax payments. 76 Clausing explained The corporate tax when it does fall on profitable companies mostly falls on the excess profits they earn from market power or other factors due to the dominance of large companies in markets with little competition luck or risktaking not the normal return on capital investment. Treasury economists calculated that such excess profits made up more than 75 of the corporate tax base by 2013. A higher corporate tax rate can rein in market power and promote a fairer economy. 76 The overseas corporate tax rate GILTI Global Intangible LowTax Income enacted in 2017 requires corporations to pay just 10.5 on overseas profits. By raising that rate to at least 21 the new minimum tax would be calculated on a countrybycountry basis rather than on a global average which would prevent companies from exploiting tax havens to drive their average rate down to the minimum and eliminate a potential incentive to locate operations in hightax foreign countries rather than the United States if the companies average foreign tax rate is below the minimum according to experts at the Center for American Progress. 78 Itai Grinberg Deputy Assistant Secretary for Multilateral Tax and Rebecca Kysar Counselor to the Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy both of the US Treasury Department argue that under current law U.S. multinational corporations face only a 10.5 minimum tax on their foreign earnings half the rate that they pay on their domestic earnings incentivizing them to operate and shift profits abroad The Made in America Tax Plan would increase the minimum tax on corporate foreign earnings to 21 reducing a corporation s incentives to shift profits and jobs abroad Under current law companies have large tax incentives to put activities and earnings offshore a strong minimum tax can reduce that tax distortion favoring activity and earnings at home. 77 Corporate taxes pay for public services and investments that help the companies suceed. By not paying their fair share of taxes corporations transfer the tax burden to small companies and individuals. 73 74 A lower federal corporate tax rate means less government tax revenue thus reducing federal programs investments and jobcreating opportunities. When the Tax Reform Act of 1986 reduced the top marginal rate from 46 to 34 the federal deficit increased from 149.7 billion to 255 billion from 19871993. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that President Trump s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the projected federal deficit from 16 trillion in 2018 to 29 trillion by 2028. 25 65 Experts at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities concluded of President Trump s tax cuts which includied a corporate tax rate cut All of that tax cutting also significantly reduced federal revenues. Federal revenues as a share of the economy gross domestic product or GDP stood at 20 percent in 2000. In 2019 at a similar peak in the business cycle federal revenues had fallen to just 16.3 percent of GDP which is far too low to support the kinds of investments needed for a 21st century economy that broadens opportunity supports workers and helps those out of work and ensures health care for everyone. 75 Using 19702007 data from the United States a Tax Foundation study found that for every 1 increase in state and local corporate tax revenues hourly wages can be expected to fall by roughly 2.50. Lower wages for workers results in a decreased ability to buy goods which leads to lower income for businesses and a net increase in unemployment. 10 11 Forbes contributor Adam A. Millsap argued It is important to remember that corporate taxes must be paid by people. Any corporate tax increase will be paid by either shareholdersowners employees in the form of lower wages or customers in the form of higher prices. A study from 2016 finds that shareholdersowners bear around 40 of state corporate income taxes while employees bear 30 to 35. So even though corporate tax increases are not levied directly on workers they still affect workers indirectly by lowering their wages. 80 Experts from the Heritage Foundation estimate between 75 and 100 of the cost of the corporate tax falls on American workers resulting in a 1.27 about 840 a year reduction in income for the average worker. They cite research that estimated a loss of 159000 jobs and a wage reduction of 1.8 if the corporate tax rate were increased to 28. 82 In 2017 the United States had the third highest combined federal and local average corporate tax rates in the world at about 39 behind only the United Arab Emirates and Puerto Rico. The high tax rate forced American companies to relocate their employees overseas. 47 Johnson Controls a company with a market value of 23 billion moved its headquarters from Milwaukee Wisconsin to Ireland in 2016. In a memo to employees a spokesperson explained the move would save the company about 150 million dollars in US taxes annually and that setting up headquarters abroad retains maximum flexibility for our balance sheet and ability to invest in growth opportunities everywhere around the world. 47 48 High corporate income tax rates encourage US companies to store their foreign earnings abroad instead of investing it into expansion and employment in the United States. The Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that untaxed foreign earnings of American companies totaled approximately 2.6 trillion in 2015. 7 49 A J.P. Morgan study found that 60 of the cash held by 602 US multinational companies was sitting in foreign accounts. If an income tax cut were offered to companies that returned this cash to the US an estimated 663 billion could be invested into business expansion and job growth in the United States. 7 49 Erica York economist and Alex Muresianu Federal Policy Analyst both of the Tax Policy Institute estimated that raising the corporate tax rate to 28 from 21 would reduce GDP Gross Domestic Product by a cumulative 720 billion over the next 10 years. 79 They continued The 720 billion in lost GDP over 10 years slightly exceeds the estimated 694 billion of tax revenue that would be raised over 10 years after accounting for the smaller economy. For instance in year 10 the economy would be about 137 billion lower and the government would raise about 65 billion of revenue implying about 2.10 of output lost for each dollar of dynamic revenue raised or about 1.34 using conventional revenue in the 10th year. 79 York and Muresianu explain Corporate income taxes are one of the most harmful ways to raise revenue. They place a higher burden on investment reduce economic output and reduce aftertax incomes across the income spectrum negative economic effects that compound over time. 79 Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said lowering corporate income tax rates would provide a certainty premium that would allow businesses to expand you would see the economy grow and momentum continue to build and unemployment continue to ease down All that will continue to build on itself. 13 Business Roundtable Tax and Fiscal Policy Committee Chair Gregory J. Hayes Chief Executive Officer of Raytheon Technologies Corporation argued Prior to the pandemic the U.S. corporate tax rate drove economic growth creating 6 million jobs pushing the unemployment rate to a 50year low and increasing middle class wages. From 2018 to 2019 major U.S. companies grew their R D by 25 percent compared to the two years prior. The current U.S. corporate tax rate has also helped put U.S. businesses on a more level playing field with global competitors and encouraged businesses to invest and grow here in the United States. 81 Did You Know?1. Of the 500 large cap companies a market capitalization value of more than 10 billion in the Standard Poor S P stock index 115 paid a federal corporate tax rate of less than 20 from 20062011 and 39 of those companies paid a rate of less than 10. 12. At 35 the United States had the highest federal corporate income tax rate of any OECD country in 2012 and at 29.2 it had the OECDs fourth highest effective corporate tax rate in 2011 behind Germany Italy and Japan. 2 443. The federal government has collected a corporate income tax since 1909 when the rate was 1 for all business income above 5000. 34. The corporate income tax rate reached 52.8 from 19681969 the highest in US history. 3 5. From 1940 to 1942 Congress passed four separate Revenue Acts which raised the top marginal corporate income tax rate from 19 to 40. 5 People who view this page may also like1.

It is not unusual for large U.S. corporations to pay no U.S. income taxes despite making billions of dollars in profits. In fact one study of corporate securities filings found 55 of America s largest companies paid no income taxes in 2020 despite generating hefty profits while netting 3.5 billion in aggregate tax rebates. Nearly half of those companies paid no U.S. income taxes for three successive years.  Among those not paying income taxes for at least three years were profitable blue chips Nike Inc. NKE FedEx Corp. FDX and Salesforce Inc. CRM.  How do profitable corporations get away with paying no U.S. income tax? Their most lucrative and perfectly legal tax avoidance strategies include accelerated depreciation the offshoring of profits generous deductions for appreciated employee stock options and tax credits.  The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA of 2017 set a flat 21 U.S. corporate income tax rate replacing the 35 top marginal rate in effect previously.  Proponents of lower corporate taxes had long complained about the 35 U.S. rate as one the highest among advanced economies. Starting in 2018 the TCJA reduced the combined federal and state U.S. corporate income tax burden to the middle of the pack in rankings by the Organization for Economic CoOperation and Development OECD based on the effective tax rate.  By other measures the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act delivered a much more generous windfall for U.S. corporations. Corporate income tax receipts fell from 1.9 of the gross domestic product GDP in 2015 to 1 of GDP in 2020. The OECD average stood at nearly 3.  In 2018 U.S. corporations paid a 7.8 average cash effective tax rate on their U.S. income versus 18 for the income they earned on the territory of the 10 largest U.S. trading partners.  The difference between the 21 statutory corporate income tax rate and the effective rate based on the cash taxes companies actually pay is the result of generous tax breaks doled out by U.S. Congress.  The 379 profitable Fortune 500 companies paid an average effective federal income tax rate of 11.3 on their 2018 income.  One of the rationales for lowering the corporate income tax rate in the debate over the TCJA was that the cut would be offset by the elimination of tax breaks and loopholes for large companies. While the new law dropped some tax subsidies it introduced many new ones. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 imposed a 15 minimum income tax on corporations earning at least 1 billion annually. The 2017 TCJA eliminated the prior version of the corporate alternative minimum tax.  Clearly corporations have become extremely savvy at finding ways to pay less in taxes. For example when Congress passed the CARES Act in response to the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 payments to families under the legislation stole the headlines. The restoration of the carryback provision for corporations net operating losses NOLs not just for 2020 but also for 2018 and 2019 on even more generous terms than those that prevailed before elimination in the TCJA received considerably less notice.  Listed below are several key corporate taxavoidance strategies. The Business Roundtable a lobbying group representing the CEOs of the largest corporations notes many of the tax breaks that can leave some companies owing no federal income tax for some years continue to enjoy strong bipartisan support.  The TCJA moderately reduced but did not eliminate the enormous savings corporations realize by shifting profits from the U.S. to countries with lower tax rates. This can be done by shifting intellectual property to a subsidiary in a tax haven and charging U.S. corporate affiliates more to use it among other tactics.  Profit shifting to lowertax countries reduced taxable income reported in the U.S. by 300 billion annually the Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 and changes under the TCJA were expected to slow the annual profit shifting by 65 billion.  At the statutory 21 U.S. tax rate this 65 billion in reported profits not shifted abroad as a result of the TCJA would produce annual tax receipts of about 13.7 billion. Of course as already noted the effective tax rate for U.S. corporations is significantly lower.  Offsetting such potential savings under the TCJA were the costs of a shift to a system reducing U.S. taxes on the earnings of overseas subsidiaries while offering a tax break on foreign income derived from intangible assets in the U.S. Those provisions were expected to save U.S. multinationals 422.1 billion in U.S. taxes over a fiveyear period through 2024.  The TCJA did impose two new taxes on the overseas earnings of U.S. multinationals. Those companies global intangible lowtaxed income GILTI defined as overseas income in excess of a 10 return on tangible assets overseas net of depreciation is now subject to U.S. taxation at a 10.5 rate rising to 13.125 in 2026.  Another TCJA stick designed to curb profit shifting the base erosion and antiabuse tax BEAT imposes a minimum tax of 10.5 on the sum of a corporations taxable income and its tax deductible payments to foreign subsidiaries other than for cost of goods sold. BEAT applies only to companies with annual gross receipts averaging more than 500 million over the three prior years that also make more than 3 of their total deductible payments to foreign affiliates.  U.S. tax receipts from GILTI and BEAT were expected to total 198.2 billion over TCJA s first decade through 2027.  Adding up the credits and the debits the TCJA s attempts to curtail profit shifting appear to be costing the U.S. Treasury significantly more than what they save. Meanwhile the business of tax havens has been largely unaffected. In 2019 corporate profits reported in Bermuda were more than four times the size of the island country s annual GDP.  When companies acquire capital assets like buildings or factory equipment they can then deduct their depreciation cost from profits over a period of years deemed to represent those assets useful life. Accelerated depreciation allows a company to write off more of the cost faster providing a larger deduction up front against taxable income.  The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act allowed companies to deduct the full cost of such qualifying investments in the year they were made from 2018 through 2022. Bonus depreciation declines to 80 in 2023 60 for 2024 40 in 2025 and 20 in 2026 before elimination in 2027.  The congressional Joint Committee on Taxation estimates accelerated depreciation of equipment will save companies more than 130 billion in federal taxes between 2020 and 2023.  The U.S. tax code is riddled with a variety of tax breaks for businesses estimated to cost the Treasury more than 100 billion annually though that s a small proportion of total U.S. tax expenditures of about 1.6 trillion annually including associated spending and foregone payroll and excise tax receipts.  The list of industryspecific credits is long it includes the 18.2 billion cost in fiscal 2022 of the credit for increasing research activities 10.7 billion the same year in foregone revenue from the credit for lowincome housing investments 2.3 billion for the orphan drug research tax credit and so on right down to the distilled spirits credit for liquor wholesalers. The energy investment credit cost 6.6 billion in 2022 not to be confused with the 4.7 billion energy production tax credit or the 230 million cost of the marginal wells credit. The tax credit for certain expenditures for maintaining railroad tracks cost the U.S. federal government 110 million in fiscal 2022.  All of this is on top of state and local tax incentives for businesses estimated to cost 95 billion annually. Federal government outlays on everything from direct payments to farm producers to the cost of operating the ExportImport Bank add up to tens of billions of dollars in direct government subsidies for business.  Some argue the prevalence of U.S. corporate tax breaks is in line with other countries. Others have noted that the U.S. tax code offers corporations uncommonly generous tax breaks for research and development client entertainment and certain legal expenses.  In their book income financial reports listed companies subtract the estimated cost of stock options granted to employees as stockbased compensation by estimating the value of the options granted.  On their U.S. federal tax returns years later the same corporations deduct the typically higher cost of exercised employee stock options from corporate taxable income based on the value of the options when exercised.  The disparity between the estimated cost of employee stock options at the time of issue and their value for expensing purposes at exercise contributed to a large and recently increased booktax gap between the net income large companies report to investors and the taxable income on their reports to the Internal Revenue Service IRS. The expensing of employee stock options saved Fortune 500 companies 10.9 billion in taxes in 2018 including nearly 9 billion for the top 25 beneficiaries and 1.6 billion for Amazon.com Inc. AMZN alone.  Supporters of the current system note that while corporations deduct the value of employee stock options from taxable income taxed at a 21 maximum rate the employees cashing them out typically pay taxes on their value at the top marginal personal income tax rate of 40.8 leaving the Treasury ahead when whose receipts are considered.  The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reinstituted the alternative minimum corporate income tax at 15 of book income for large corporations. The book or financial income used to assess the tax would be adjusted for depreciation and wireless spectrum rights recovery carryover losses up to 80 of financial income as well as domestic business tax credits that could offset up to 75 of the tax liability and foreign business credits up to the allowance for foreign taxes paid on the financial statements.  The new alternative minimum tax was expected to apply to approximately 150 of the largest U.S. companies and raise 222 billion in U.S. federal tax revenue over a decade representing an increase of 4.7 in corporate tax revenues.  The law also imposes a new 1 excise tax on corporate share repurchases which was expected to raise 73.7 billion over a decade.  The Inflation Reduction Act also increased IRS funding by nearly 80 billion over a decade the Biden Administration publicly committed not to use the funds to increase auditing of taxpayers earning less than 400000 annually. Increased tax enforcement for the highest earners and corporations was expected to generate 204 billion in additional tax revenue over a decade.  The law provides 369 billion in tax credits over a decade to businesses and individuals for investments in renewable power clean transportation and energy security.  The U.S. tax code has conflicting aims. Its objective of equitably maximizing federal tax receipts is frequently at odds with a variety of tailored tax breaks pursuing diverse policy goals.  So long as efforts to make large corporations pay their fair share must coexist with tax credits and deductions encouraging a wide range of favored activities corporate lobbyists and tax lawyers will remain in demand.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/08/14/biden-corporate-tax/, Instead the policy championed by President Biden remains bogged down in Washington amid growing legal uncertainty and a barrage of fierce lobbying by companies that don t want to foot the bill. Nearly a year after its enactment the U.S. government still has not yet fully implemented the new corporate alternative minimum tax as the Biden administration races to finalize a complex and critical element of Democrats broader economic agenda. Its fate rests in the hands of the Treasury Department whose forthcoming rules will determine if Biden can achieve his promises to lower the federal deficit and force businesses to pay their fair share.  It s my sense we re going to raise less revenue from the tax than we initially hoped said Jeffrey Hoopes a tax professor at the University of North Carolina who previously warned Congress that its vision may not translate to good policy. Democratic lawmakers envisioned the new corporate minimum tax as a way to pay for their signature spending package the Inflation Reduction Act which included costly new programs to combat climate change and lower healthcare costs. Party leaders explicitly targeted a small set of companies that regularly report massive multibilliondollar profits to shareholders yet remit little to the government each year. In a fiscal review of the policy the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated last year that about 150 corporate taxpayers could be forced to pay the new tax later finding it could generate more than 222 billion in federal revenue over the next decade. But exactly which firms pay and how much money the government takes in hinges on a series of unresolved legal issues that stem from a law written in haste. In the meantime major lobbying organizations that represent companies like AT T Amazon Duke Energy Ford and FedEx have seized on the uncertainty to press for changes that may reduce their tax bills. One group representing gas utilities even warned they could raise prices on customers depending on how the administration implemented the tax rules. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post and interim Post CEO Patty Stonesifer sits on the company s board. The developments have raised fears among some watchdogs that savvy corporations could end up paying far less than Biden envisioned skirting a policy that explicitly aims to prevent profitable firms from dodging taxes.  These lobbies exist not to create clarity in the tax law but to reduce the tax liability of the companies they represent said Matt Gardner a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a leftleaning group. How the Inflation Reduction Act might affect you and change the U.S. Two years earlier the organization found that 55 companies including Duke Nike the steelmaker Nucor and Salesforce each paid nothing in taxes on their 2020 profits a figure that Biden repeatedly cited as he made the case for a sweeping overhaul. While he initially sought to raise the overall corporate rate to 28 percent from 21 percent the president ultimately settled on a series of lesser policies targeting corporate profits. One new tax applies to companies that repurchase their stock. Since its adoption companies including Apple Google and Wells Fargo have announced a series of sizable buybacks prompting Biden recently to call on Congress to quadruple the tax to 4 percent. The other is the new 15 percent corporate minimum initially championed by lawmakers including Sen. Elizabeth Warren DMass. and modeled in some ways after a similar effort in the 1980s. Touting the tax over the past year Biden has charged it is wrong that businesses can use generous deductions under the existing tax code sometimes reducing their bills to zero while teachers firefighters and other workers pay more than that.  Generally companies that earn 1 billion or more per year averaged over a threeyear period are supposed to owe the tax. Large firms are expected to compute what they would normally pay after accounting for deductions that can reduce their tax bill then conduct an alternative calculation based on their financial statements known as book income. They essentially are expected to pay the larger of the two. But Congress left critical details up to the Treasury Department which issued its initial guidance last year. The document little noticed outside corporate boardrooms and large accounting firms signaled the agency is still setting the terms for how companies should determine their income and more broadly which policies in the byzantine corporate tax code should apply to the new system.  We value stakeholder input as we ve worked on this project but we keep as our north star congressional intent which is the idea of making sure we make the tax code more fair said Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo. With so much to resolve though the IRS announced in June that it does not expect companies to begin estimating and paying the new tax yet on a quarterly basis and as a result would not assess penalties on those who failed to do so. Tax experts described the pause as a common practice albeit one that has illustrated the complexity of the task the government now faces.  There are virtues to the corporate alternative minimum tax but I don t think anyone with a straight face thinks that simplicity is one of them said ChyeChing Huang the executive director of the Tax Law Center at the NYU School of Law. It s a lot of decisions Congress has left to Treasury and the IRS to figure out in some of the hardest areas.  Biden won a global tax rate. Now Americans wonder if it was a good deal. Already a widening array of firms including Netflix Salesforce and Warner Bros. Discovery have told investors they are evaluating if they might face new federal tax liabilities under the law. The insurer AIG warned in February it may be required to pay the tax. In an early attempt to pinpoint who might be liable Hoopes and researchers at UNC studied companies financial statements up to 2021 before lawmakers adopted the Inflation Reduction Act and found 78 firms that year would have faced 31.8 billion in liabilities. That included Berkshire Hathaway the conglomerate owned by Warren Buffett which may have owed 8.3 billion in taxes under the law. Amazon would have faced a roughly 2.7 billion bill Ford Motor Co. would have owed 1.8 billion and AT T might have had to pay 1.5 billion according to the analysis released last September. Hoopes cautioned in a recent interview that the study was only a projection as corporate tax filings are not public. It also hinged on an assumption that Treasury might recognize for tax purposes the gains and losses in the value of some corporate assets and investments even if they are not actually sold. Like much of the law Congress left that matter somewhat ambiguous though Hoopes said the government since then has signaled it is disinclined to do so which might limit the reach and possibly the revenueraising potential of the new tax.  The vast majority of earnings reports I see say We don t expect to be subject to this Hoopes said. At least one firm Berkshire Hathaway later reported it currently does not expect that compliance with the provisions of the 2022 act will have a material impact on its finances according to its most recent earnings report. The company did not respond to a request for comment. For the Treasury Department the fiscal stakes are high since Democrats fashioned the tax as a way to ensure the Inflation Reduction Act reduces the deficit. Since its adoption though federal budget watchdogs have projected its price tag could reach as high as 660 billion more than 60 percent higher than early estimates according to the JCT. The spike is due in large part to higherthanexpected demand for clean energy tax credits including those that encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles. Congress also included a series of carveouts that allow companies to use some research and investment expenses to offset their taxes mirroring the existing code in a way that could lower corporate tax bills. And lawmakers further agreed to shield entire industries including real estate conglomerates and wealthy privateequity firms from the new tax. Sen. Kyrsten Sinema Ariz. now an independent who caucuses with Democrats pushed to protect private equity as part of a lastminute deal to win her musthave vote.  There were all these other adjustments that came along that made this tax look more and more like the regular corporate tax said Will McBride the vice president of federal tax and economic policy at the Tax Foundation a rightleaning organization. That he said threatened to depress revenue and raised the prospect that taxpayers could ultimately face an effective tax rate that s lower than the statutory tax rate.  Some corporations in recent months have shifted their lobbying to the Treasury Department urging the agency to take a lenient hand or risk a potential threat to economic growth.  There are reasons and incentives that Congress gave businesses to do certain good things in the economy said Lara Muldoon the senior director for government affairs at the Information Technology Industry Council a trade group that represents Amazon Facebook Google and other technology giants.  We want to make sure that for items that have effect in preIRA years you re not getting penalized for them because you made decisions before anyone ever thought a book tax would be implemented said Chris Netram the head of policy at the National Association of Manufacturers whose leadership includes executives from Caterpillar Dow ExxonMobile Johnson Johnson and other major companies. Business Roundtable declined to comment and ACT did not respond to a request. The American Gas Association which represents utilities sought to ensure the minimum tax allowed companies to take a series of deductions under the existing tax code that benefit the construction and repair of their facilities. Those deductions provide a substantial benefit to the customers of their companies the group wrote warning that a failure to incorporate them will void this customer benefit and result in substantial increases to customer rates. The group did not respond to a request for comment. As the Biden administration crafts its rules some opponents similarly have reengaged the issue on Capitol Hill according to two congressional Democratic aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe private discussions. Oil companies for example have sought special treatment for new drilling costs under the minimum tax one of the people said even though the Inflation Reduction Act aimed to reduce the country s dependence on fossil fuels. Representatives for major privateequity firms including Blackstone and the Carlyle Group similarly have blitzed lawmakers attempting to ensure they are not taxed based on the gains and losses of assets they have not sold according to Democratic aides. Blackstone did not respond to a request for comment and a spokeswoman for Carlyle Group declined to comment. In its most recent earnings report Blackstone signaled it expects to have a liability in 2023 while Carlyle indicated in its annual report this March that the tax provisions broadly in the Inflation Reduction Act have not had and are currently not expected to have a material impact on its finances. Even in the face of intense corporate lobbying experts say they still expect Treasury to offer additional guidance about the tax how it applies and to whom it applies before the end of the year. In the meantime top administration officials have promised that their labors still can erase decades of corporate tax dodging.  By ensuring large profitable companies and highincome individuals pay their fair share through these provisions and others we are making our tax system and economy work better for everyday Americans said Lily Batchelder the assistant treasury secretary for tax policy in a speech in San Diego earlier this year.
