https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/state/sales-tax-base-broadening/, Since the creation of the modern sales tax in 1930 state sales tax bases have been narrower than ideal. Economic theory says that sales taxes should apply to all final personal consumption yet partly due to historic accident and partly due to policy efforts to exempt some goods the median state sales tax base covers only 23 percent of final personal income. The narrow tax bases undermine neutrality favoring one product or industry over another. States have experimented with broadening their sales taxes but most efforts have been piecemeal and frequently involved additional taxation of businesstobusiness transactions. Meaningful base broadeningBase broadening is the expansion of the amount of economic activity subject to tax usually by eliminating exemptions exclusions deductions credits and other preferences. Narrow tax bases are nonneutral favoring one product or industry over another and can undermine revenue stability. however remains a worthwhile endeavor as base expansion allows for greater tax neutrality and revenue stability and can be paired with more targeted relief for lowincome households. In 1930 Mississippi became the first state to adopt a general sales tax.2 In the decade that followed 23 other states followed suit see map below as the Great Depression disrupted state and local economies. In 1927 property taxes made up 20 percent of state government revenue and 82 percent of local government revenue. In total twothirds of all state and local government revenue came from property taxes. However from 1929 to 1936 property taxA property tax is primarily levied on immovable property like land and buildings as well as on tangible personal property that is movable like vehicles and equipment. Property taxes are the single largest source of state and local revenue in the U.S. and help fund schools roads police and other services. assessments fell substantially approximately a 20 percent decline. The decline in property values combined with deteriorating farm prices and high industrial unemployment reduced property tax collections.3 At the same time individual and corporate income taxes became less productive. These revenue constraints were coupled with increased spending mandates from the federal government. Participation in new government programs required investments by states.4 States began to look for alternative sources of revenue to fund government services and began turning to the sales tax. The sales tax as John Due and John Mikesell have noted with its low rate large yield and relatively painless collection was especially attractive. 5  Currently 45 states impose a sales tax. Only Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon forgo a sales tax.6 When states began to levy a sales tax in the 1930s the tax applied to tangible personal property items such as clothing home appliances and furniture among other taxable goods.7 This made the tax relatively easy to administer. It also produced sufficient revenue as the economy largely consisted of manufacturing and tangible goods. Over time however the U.S. economy has changed from a manufacturingbased economy to a servicebased economy. Americans are purchasing more services than goods as a percentage of their consumption. In the first quarter of 2017 services accounted for approximately 68 percent of personal consumption expenditures in the United States.8 Despite the transformation in the economy states have responded slowly to updating their sales tax bases.   The economic transition to a servicebased economy is not the only reason sales tax bases are shrinking. This trend has accelerated as states exempted a variety of household goods to mitigate the perceived regressivity of the sales tax. Together these two longterm trends have led to improper sales tax bases. The median state s sales tax base only includes 23 percent of a state s personal income.9 Despite goods representing a declining share of the economy they remain an important component of consumption representing 32 percent of total personal consumption.10 While services have in large part been exempt from taxation due to historic reasons goods are frequently exempt from sales tax bases due to proactive exemptions issued by state legislatures. This is frequently due to perception of the regressive nature of the sales tax. Proponents of exempting consumption goods point out that the sales tax is regressive. They argue that lowincome households spend a larger portion of their income on these goods and therefore there is an inherent inequity in taxing necessities.11 It is unfair to tax basic needs per their argument. While it is true that such a tax would be regressive that does not mean that exemptions are the correct policy choice. These arguments sometimes presuppose that sales taxes should only apply to luxury goods not necessities but again this is a political argument not one of economics.12 These arguments also tend to overestimate the extent to which sales taxes are regressive. In the short term sales tax are regressive but economic research shows that over a lifetime the sales tax is only slightly regressive. 13 According to Laird Graeser individuals adjust their spending patterns to approximate their longterm economic power and consumer proportionately to this longterm expectation of income. Assuming that all consumption is taxed equally lifetime consumption taxes are proportional to lifetime income. 14 Even so states frequently address regressivity issues by modifying their sales tax base. 15 The common exempted goods in the United States include clothing groceries and prescription drugs.16 Twentyfive states and the District of Columbia exempted two or more of these goods in 2017 see Table 2. These goods represent a significant portion of a state tax base. Louisiana estimates that its sales tax exemptionA tax exemption excludes certain income revenue or even taxpayers from tax altogether. For example nonprofits that fulfill certain requirements are granted taxexempt status by the Internal Revenue Service IRS preventing them from having to pay income tax. for groceries cost the state 424 million in fiscal year 2016 while its exemption for prescription drugs costed 358 million for the same fiscal year.17 Arkansas which still taxes groceries at 1.5 percent lost an estimated 197 million in fiscal year 2012 the most recent year for which data are available.18 Exemptions can force odd choices for consumers. New York s clothing exemption only applies to clothing or footwear costing less than 110. This creates an incentive to purchase an item that is slightly less than 110 rather than one that is slightly above 110 regardless of the consumer s preference for one item or the other.19 But sales tax exemptions can extend far behind clothing groceries and prescription drugs. Many states exempt flags newspapers and magazines from the sales tax items that are far from being considered necessities. Pennsylvania even exempts youth sports programs.20 A number of states in recent years have moved to exempt feminine hygiene products from sales taxes.21 States can also engage in shortterm sales tax exemptions known as sales tax holidays. In 2017 16 states held sales tax holidays 22 ranging from back to school holidays to ones for hurricane preparedness in Florida. Sales tax holidays involve political gimmicks and favor one industry or product over another.23 States also tend to exempt items which are subject to additional excise taxes such as gasoline or cigarettes. Only four states Hawaii Illinois Indiana and Michigan completely include gasoline in their sales tax base.24 It is often stated that these products are exempt from the sales tax base because of concerns over double taxationDouble taxation is when taxes are paid twice on the same dollar of income regardless of whether that s corporate or individual income. however this argument falls flat. These taxes have two separate purposes. Gasoline along with other items is indeed final personal consumption and it should be taxed accordingly. It can also then be true that gasoline is a good proxy for road usage and an excise taxAn excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or activity. Excise taxes are commonly levied on cigarettes alcoholic beverages soda gasoline insurance premiums amusement activities and betting and typically make up a relatively small and volatile portion of state and local and to a lesser extent federal tax collections. to fund general transportation expenditures is necessary. But the presence of an excise tax does not negate that gasoline should be subject to a general sales tax. If the total tax burden is deemed too high the preferred approach is to lower the excise tax not to exempt the item from the general sales tax.25 While several states have made forays in this direction such as Florida s brief attempt in 198626 most states do not broadly tax personal services in their sales tax base. The lack of sales tax on services is one of historical accident not logic. 27 As John Due described Acquisition of services by households constitute consumption expenditure in the same fashion as the purchase of commodities there is no basic difference between the two that warrants different tax treatment. 28 Not taxing services similar to exempting goods introduces distortions into consumer decisions. Imagine that a state taxes the purchase of appliances but does not tax repair services.29 This encourages the consumer to repair the current appliance rather than purchase a new one. There are obviously many reasons why someone could decide that repairing an appliance is preferable to purchasing new but now the sales tax treatment has given repair companies a competitive advantage over appliance retailers.30 The tax code should not favor the repair industry over the retailing industry. Table 3 shows four selected personal services and whether they are taxable in each state. An overly narrow sales tax base introduces a number of problems. Sales taxes are not neutral across consumer purchases and they are not as effective at raising revenue as they could be. Furthermore exempting items is also not an ideal way to address regressivity. Base broadening fixes these issues and also reduces tax administration costs. However all base broadening must provide exemptions for businesstobusiness transactions. The presence of exemptions creates demand for further exemptions as political interests organize to demand more exemptions. Broadening the tax base sends a strong signal in the opposite direction. The overall goal of expanding the sales tax base is increased neutrality within the tax code. Consumers are likely to shift towards untaxed purchases regardless of their actual preferences. Ideally the sales tax would apply to all consumer transactions as to not bias consumer behavior.31 Investment can also be misappropriated due to sales tax exemptions. Firms or industries might see increased demand encouraging further expansion through capital expenditures. Narrower bases also limit the ability to collect necessary revenues. A broader sales tax base provides the opportunity for additional revenue because there is a larger basket of goods and services to tax. In contrast exempting items from the sales tax base means that the tax rate on taxable items must be higher than it would otherwise be. Pennsylvania s sales tax exemptions on groceries prescription drugs and clothing totaled 3.2 billion in fiscal year 2016 compared to the 10 billion in total sales tax collections for the state. The sales tax on all the remaining taxable items must be significantly higher to offset the 3.2 billion in exempted purchases. These are obviously not the only sales tax exemptions in Pennsylvania adding all of Pennsylvania s exemptions would result in an even greater imbalance. Tax rates in Pennsylvania are notably higher to generate the 10 billion in revenue than they could be if the base was expanded to include these previously exempted transactions. Additionally narrow sales tax bases hinder a key feature of consumption taxes revenue stability. Sales tax revenue collections are currently dominated by large purchases such as appliances furniture or motor vehicles all types of items where purchases slow during times of economic weakness. Expanding the sales tax base to include items deemed to be essential such as food and clothing limits the volatility of collections. Even during recessionA recession is a significant and sustained decline in the economy. Typically a recession lasts longer than six months but recovery from a recession can take a few years.s these basic necessities would be purchased though the items purchased might vary slightly for instance away from expensive cuts of meat like steak to less expensive like ground beef. Carving away the base introduces more volatility to revenue collections. Blanket exemptions are also blunt instruments for ameliorating regressivity which as discussed previously is often overstated. Exempting all grocery items while sold as a help to lowincome taxpayers benefits all consumers regardless of their income level. Arguably the exemption actually benefits higherincome individuals more than lowerincome individuals as their total grocery spending will be higher. These families might spend substantial amounts on expensive cuts of meat fresh fruit out of season exotic seafoods and other items. 32 Households that shop at more expensive grocery chains or buy more expensive items benefit disproportionately from the exemption.33 Additional research has found that broadening sales tax bases and using the new revenues to reduce rates is actually less regressive than the status quo. For instance a study by the Minnesota Department of Revenue found that an expanded base and lower rate of 5 percent down from 6.5 percent would be less regressive than their current structure.34 Additionally sales tax base broadening can be used to fund other tax reforms. Expanding the sales tax base increases revenue providing the funds necessary to offset tax changes in other areas. For instance North Carolina s tax reform in 2013 lowered and flattened its individual income taxAn individual income tax or personal income tax is levied on the wages salaries investments or other forms of income an individual or household earns. The U.S. imposes a progressive income tax where rates increase with income. The Federal Income Tax was established in 1913 with the ratification of the 16th Amendment. Though barely 100 years old individual income taxes are the largest source of tax revenue in the U.S. and lowered corporate income taxA corporate income tax CIT is levied by federal and state governments on business profits. Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as passthrough businesses with income reportable under the individual income tax.. The changes were in part financed with a broadened sales tax base that included admissions charges to live entertainment movies and certain attractions. The District of Columbia followed a similar path. Its tax reform package in 2014 included an expansion of the sales tax to include gym memberships among other items.35 These sales tax base expansions helped finance cuts to the individual and corporate income tax and an expanded Earned Income Tax CreditA tax credit is a provision that reduces a taxpayer s final tax bill dollarfordollar. A tax credit differs from deductions and exemptions which reduce taxable income rather than the taxpayer s tax bill directly. EITC. Broadening the sales tax base also eases tax administration.36 Much time and effort is spent trying to distinguish between taxable and nontaxable items leading to complex and complicated questions on how to define various items. Many states for example do not tax groceries but do tax candy and soda. But what are the defining features of candy?37 This quickly becomes a difficult question. In many states the inclusion of flour makes an item food and therefore exempt while candy without flour would be taxable. The presence of sweeteners could make something candy too. New Jersey includes sweetened chocolate chips in its tax base but excludes unsweetened chocolate chips.38 The Wisconsin Department of Revenue released a guidance document in 2010 discussing the various tests for determining whether an ice cream cake was subject to the sales tax.39 Taxability hinges on several key questions such as whether the retailer provides utensils and if there are multiple food items like fudge and a cake layer in the ice cream cake. These kinds of tax structures create unnecessary compliance costs for businesses and for the state. Now all of this is not to say that expanding the sales tax base is without challenge. Questions regarding situsing40 particularly around services are important but broader bases reduce the costs of tax administration.41 While all final consumption both goods and services should be taxed within a sales tax it is crucial that consumption by businesses should be exempted.42 This is not due to a preference for businesses over the general public but rather an attempt to avoid tax pyramidingTax pyramiding occurs when the same final good or service is taxed multiple times along the production process. This yields vastly different effective tax rates depending on the length of the supply chain and disproportionately harms lowmargin firms. Gross receipts taxes are a prime example of tax pyramiding in action.. 43 By taxing inputs goods or services the price of the final product becomes more expensive taxes are assessed multiple times as the goods or services come to market increasing costs and yielding higher prices for consumers. Firms would pass the burden of the tax forward to their customers to manage their profit margins and the multiple layers of sales taxes on inputs would turn the state sales tax into a gross receipts taxA gross receipts tax also known as a turnover tax is applied to a company s gross sales without deductions for a firm s business expenses like costs of goods sold and compensation. Unlike a sales tax a gross receipts tax is assessed on businesses and apply to businesstobusiness transactions in addition to final consumer purchases leading to tax pyramiding..  But passing the tax forward isn t always possible. In firms or industries with strong price competition firms would be hesitant to pass costs directly to consumers. In some cases such as products with suggested manufacturers retailing pricing and national pricing strategies the retailer is strictly prohibited from passing the costs forward.44 In those instances the firm instead might shift the increased costs to labor perhaps by cutting hour and benefits or limiting overall hiring. It also introduces a number of biases. Items with longer production cycles bear a disproportionate share of the tax. Firms may choose to streamline the production process so that everything is made inhouse. In this way they would not be subject to the sales tax on business purchases creating an incentive for vertical integration. At its most extreme taxing all business inputs converts a sales tax into a gross receipts tax.45 However most states exist somewhere in between a purely personal consumptionbased sales tax and a gross receipts tax. According to data from the Council on State Taxation firms paid 150 billion in general sales taxes on inputs in fiscal year 2015.46 Care must be given to ensure that any base broadening does not unintentionally include businesstobusiness transactions. As discussed sales tax exemptions are frequently rooted in concerns over the regressive nature of sales taxes. However limiting tax bases through blanket exemption is a problematic approach in terms of both neutrality and administration. There are several preferred ways to ameliorate regressivity without providing broad exemptions in a sales tax code. Expanding sales tax bases to services is one way to broaden the tax base in a relatively progressive fashion.47 Consumption of many personal services such as cosmetic and beauty services fitness pet grooming and veterinary services and landscaping among others skews towards the higher end of the income scale. Including personal services would increase tax neutrality while providing for increased revenue allowing the state to reduce the overall tax rate. Tax credits could protect lowincome households without preventing a broad base sales tax structure. One option for states is to increase the Earned Income Tax Credit EITC for lowincome households. Currently 26 states and the District of Columbia have their own EITC in addition to the federal one. Twentytwo of these states make the credits fully refundable if the amount exceeds taxes owed.48 Providing an EITC would also eliminate nonneutralities introduced by exemptions while providing an offset to any regressive effects of the sales tax. Another option is to apply a grocery tax credit to offset the sales tax paid on food purchases similar to those instituted in Oklahoma and Idaho. Residents in Idaho receive a tax credit of 100 to offset sales tax paid on groceries.49 Oklahoma s credit is 40 per year if the household income is below 20000 or below 50000 for those who have at least one dependent.50 In both states the credit is refundable for those without income tax liability. As noted previously blanket food exemptions actually provide substantial tax cuts to highincome households as all their grocery purchases are also exempt. Food purchases would no longer be exempt from taxation as they currently are in most states which disproportionately benefits those with high food expenditures. A grocery tax credit is a more targeted approach.51 Finally states can always increase the standard deduction for their income taxes for those filing single married filing jointly or head of households. An increase in the standard deduction has been a part of the successful tax reform packages North Carolina has enacted in the last few years as a means to protect lowincome households. The proliferation of internet retailing provides a challenge to states. As more individuals purchase items via online retailers state sales tax collections have fallen as many retailers do not have sufficient nexus traditionally defined as property or payroll in a state to require the retailer to collect and remit sales taxes. Many online retailers fail to meet this standard putting strain on state sales taxes. The scope of the issue however is not immediately clear. Americans spent almost 400 billion online in 2016 or approximately 8 percent of all retail sales.52 However given narrow state sales tax bases it s not obvious that all these transactions would be taxable if they had been purchased inperson via a brickandmortar location. A 2009 study53 estimated that state revenue collections would fall by 11 billion in 2012 due to internet purchases however their estimates seem too large based on state experiences.54 In 2017 Amazon the largest online retailer announced that it would start collecting sales tax on its purchases excluding items sold via its Marketplace feature in all states with a sales tax likely increasing state sales tax collections and limiting the amount of lost revenue.55 Partly due to historic accident and partly due to proactively carving up their tax base state sales tax bases are exceedingly small with the median state only taxing 23 percent of its personal income. The lack of a broad tax base introduces a number of distortions to the marketplace influencing consumer behavior. Expanding state sales tax bases improves neutrality. Frequently sales tax base exemptions are presented as a way to make the tax code more progressive but broad sales tax exemptions can actually benefit highincome households more than lowincome households. States concerned about regressivity should consider other options than broad exemptions for entire classes of goods. Sales taxes are key in a state revenue toolkit for numerous reasons such as revenue yield and stability and ease of administration but if states continue to erode the base through exemptions the effectiveness of sales taxes will be lessened. Expanding sales tax bases to services and removing previouslypassed exemptions would allow states to improve the revenue collections and stability from their taxes while improving neutrality. States should confront this challenge if they hope to retain this important feature in their revenue toolkits. 1 The author thanks Isai Chavez for his research assistance and analysis. 2 John F.

A slowdown in tax revenue is forcing states to scale back ambitious projects or raise taxes to help pay for them. Brandon BellGetty Images From health care for immigrants in California to universal school vouchers in Tennessee states are being forced to rethink expensive projects as tax revenues decline and federal pandemic aid ends. State tax revenue fell last year by 4 according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28 though higher than the inflation rate of about 18 in that time. California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined 56 billion in state tax revenue the bulk of the 66 billion national loss. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to 73 billion called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes including a proposed 1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for lowincome people regardless of immigration status. Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion which would include 4 billion in state funds money we don t have for illegal immigrants in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber who is also a San Diego physician said the expansion would mean we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.  The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction homeless housing broadband or transit funding. Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead  Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia according to the Stateline analysis. Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee s 140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools. Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee s voucher plan includes an extra 320 million for public school funding in rural areas staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs spending the state can t afford given its 400 million budget deficit he said. Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle In New Jersey where state tax revenue dropped 4 last year but remains 32 higher than 2019 Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about 1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people. In Arizona a projected 1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8 or about 1.9 billion last year compared with 2022 but up 26 from 2019. Some states economies cool even as the nation s sizzles  Tax cuts may be coming home to roost for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic slowing states ability to improve things such as schools and housing said Wesley Tharpe senior adviser for state tax policy at the leftleaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax Tharpe said. In several states the reductions are really genuinely historic like Arizona North Carolina West Virginia. It s not only that states might have to cut services when they cut taxes this deeply it s also that they re forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.

State tax revenue fell last year by 4 according to a Stateline analysis of U.S. Census Bureau estimates released this month. Revenue is still up since 2019 by about 28 though higher than the inflation rate of about 18 in that time. California and New York bore a disproportionate share of the loss even accounting for their large populations. Those states lost a combined 56 billion in state tax revenue the bulk of the 66 billion national loss. California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom confronting a budget deficit that has ballooned to 73 billion called on lawmakers to reopen the state budget for changes including a proposed 1.5 billion increase in taxes on health insurers to maintain an expansion of state health insurance for lowincome people regardless of immigration status. Republican Assemblymember Bill Essayli called the expansion which would include 4 billion in state funds money we don t have for illegal immigrants in a March 14 budget committee meeting ahead of an Assembly vote. Democratic Assemblymember Akilah Weber who is also a San Diego physician said the expansion would mean we can keep on doing our work and helping patients without having to cut services.  The higher tax would need to be approved by March 21 to get federal approval. The governor and lawmakers are negotiating other budget changes which could include more taxes or billions of dollars in cuts to school construction homeless housing broadband or transit funding. Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead  Conservative agendas also are under scrutiny as tax revenues dipped in 32 states last year and failed to keep up with inflation in 40 states and the District of Columbia according to the Stateline analysis. Tennessee Republicans favor Republican Gov. Bill Lee s 140 million proposal for universal school vouchers. But a budget deficit has some GOP members questioning increased public school funding meant to sweeten the deal and dampen opposition from Democrats and others who fear the program will harm public schools. Republican state Rep. Charlie Baum noted that the current House version of Lee s voucher plan includes an extra 320 million for public school funding in rural areas staff health insurance subsidies and construction costs spending the state can t afford given its 400 million budget deficit he said. Some states are adding taxes to find more money as surpluses dwindle In New Jersey where state tax revenue dropped 4 last year but remains 32 higher than 2019 Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy asked lawmakers to approve a tax on large businesses to support the state transit system by raising about 1 billion this year. The extra funds may help preserve a program to lower property taxes for older people. In Arizona a projected 1.7 billion budget deficit looms after a flat income tax enacted by Republican Gov. Doug Ducey in 2021 took effect last year. Current Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs proposed clawing back money from road projects and school vouchers approved under rosier forecasts. The Stateline analysis shows Arizona state tax revenue was down 8 or about 1.9 billion last year compared with 2022 but up 26 from 2019. Some states economies cool even as the nation s sizzles  Tax cuts may be coming home to roost for states such as Arizona that cut deeply during the pandemic slowing states ability to improve things such as schools and housing said Wesley Tharpe senior adviser for state tax policy at the leftleaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  More than half of states used the cover of temporary surpluses coming out of the COVID19 recovery to enact permanent reductions in their state income tax Tharpe said. In several states the reductions are really genuinely historic like Arizona North Carolina West Virginia. It s not only that states might have to cut services when they cut taxes this deeply it s also that they re forgoing revenues that could be used for unmet needs.  But conservatives insist cutting taxes will help states in the long run by putting more money back in the hands of consumers and attracting more highincome workers.

This go around it s the retail sales tax. Advocates praise the simplicity the potential for economic growth the enforceability and the fairness of a tax system based on consumption. But when examined closely the simplicity breaks down payments would be close to impossible to collect and the tax s fairness would be at best questionable. Nonetheless more plausible consumption and income tax reform plans should not be ignored. The politics of tax reform are cyclical and once again we re hearing the call for sweeping change. The flat tax and the idea of fundamental tax reform dominated policy discussions in 1995 and the early part of 1996. These proposals aimed to replace the income tax drastically simplify taxes and spur economic growth by flattening tax rates eliminating tax preferences and taxing consumption rather than income. In 1997 however Congress and the President moved in essentially the opposite direction. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 showered new deductions and credits on various groups of taxpayers made taxes more complicated and raised effective marginal tax rates for many people. Now as 1998 begins there are once again renewed calls to tear out the income tax and start over. Although the flat tax has certainly not disappeared the newest plan to attract significant attention is a national retail sales tax. Representatives Dan Schaefer RColo. and Billy Tauzin RLa. have proposed a 15 percent sales tax which they claim will replace the personal and corporate income taxes and the estate tax. A group called Americans for Fair Taxation has launched a multimillion dollar campaign to replace income estate and payroll taxes with what they claim would be a 23 percent sales tax. These plans would tax almost all private consumption and all government expenditures. Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer RTexas has indicated general support for a sales tax but to date has officially kept his options open. Sales tax advocates claim their plans would dramatically boost prospects for economic growth simplify the tax system to the point where states could collect the tax and the IRS could be abolished reduce costs of compliance by an order of magnitude and provide Americans with a tax system that is fair visible and understandable. All worthy goals but that s a very tall order. Can it be filled? Retail sales occur when businesses sell goods or services to households. Businesstobusiness transactions are not retail sales because the purchase is used as an input not as household consumption. Householdtohousehold sales of goods or services are not included either since tax should have already been paid when the good was originally sold to a household from a business. For example the sale of a newly constructed home to a family that will occupy it is a retail sale. But the sale of that same newly constructed home to a business that is planning on renting it to others is not a retail sale. Nor is a sale of an already existing home from one occupant to another. Measuring the sales tax rate would seem to be a simple problem. Suppose a good costs 100 and there is a 30 sales tax placed on the item. Most people would probably consider that to be a 30 percent sales tax since the tax is 30 percent of the selling price. This is known as the taxexclusive tax rate. An alternative would divide the 30 tax payment by the total cost to the consumer 10030 making it a 23 percent rate. This is known as the taxinclusive tax rate. Sales taxes are typically quoted as taxexclusive rates. Income tax rates however are typically quoted as taxinclusive rates. For example a household that earns 130 and pays 30 in taxes would normally think of itself as facing about a 23 percent 30130 income tax rate. Although there is no one true method of reporting the rate it is crucial to understand which approach is being used since the taxinclusive rate will always be lower than the taxexclusive rate and the difference grows as the rates rise. At a rate of 1 percent the difference is negligible but a 50 percent taxexclusive rate corresponds to a 33 percent taxinclusive rate. Both the SchaeferTauzin ST and the Americans for Fair Taxation AFT plans would attempt to tax all goods or services purchased or used in the United States. Exemptions would be provided for business purchases for resales purchases to produce taxable property or services and exports. Expenditure on education would be exempted on the grounds that it is an investment. The sale of newly constructed singlefamily homes would be taxed as would improvements to existing singlefamily houses. Already existing owneroccupied housing would be exempted. All financial intermediation services would be taxed. The tax would exempt expenditures abroad by U.S. residents and half of foreign travel but tax domestic expenditures by nonresidents. Notably the proposals would tax all federal state and local government consumption items as well as government investment in equipment and structures. The plans would offer demogrants or rebates for each family equal to the tax rate times the poverty line the amount of income a family needs officially to stay out of poverty. Both plans would allow businesses who remit taxes to government to retain a small percentage of revenues collected as compensation for collection costs. A national retail sales tax structured along these lines would represent a sharp break from the current tax system. First the tax base would shift. Currently our system taxes something loosely related to income. Under a pure sales tax the base would be consumption. Second marginal tax rates currently rise with income but would be flat in a sales tax. Third for reasons of social policy tax administration and politics the income tax contains a series of deductions exemptions and tax credits. Under the proposed sales tax all of these would be eliminated. Finally the sales tax would make vast changes in the tax system s administration enforcement and point of collection. Sales taxes already exist in 45 states the District of Columbia and over 6000 localities. State tax rates range from 3 percent to 7 percent. While state sales taxes are widely viewed as successful they are very poor models for federal reform. States only tax about half of private consumption of goods and services. Many states exempt goods such as food electricity telephone service prescription medicine and so on. Most states do not tax services very well if at all. In addition between 20 and 40 percent of state sales tax revenue stems from business purchases which are not retail sales. This causes cascading of the sales tax which distorts relative prices in capricious ways and gives firms incentives to merge with other firms in order to avoid the tax. States often do not require their own government to pay sales taxes. And states do not provide demogrants instead they help the poor by exempting specific items like food. These findings suggest that running a pure broadbased sales tax as envisioned by ST and AFT could be quite difficult in practice. Determining the appropriate tax rate in a national sales tax can be tricky. For example if a there is zero tax evasion b state and local taxes do not change c the tax base is not reduced by political or other factors d nominal government spending is held constant and e transition issues and economic growth are ignored the AFT proposal would require a 23 percent tax on a taxinclusive basis or a 30 percent tax rate in the more familiar taxexclusive approach. All of the following rates are taxexclusive. But realistic adjustments for each of the stringent conditions listed above raises the estimated tax rate. The tax evasion rate under the income tax is between 15 and 20 percent. Evasion issues are discussed in the next section here we simply note that a 15 percent evasion rate in the sales tax which is probably conservative would raise the rate to 35 percent. In the absence of federal income taxes states would likely have to convert their own income taxes to sales taxes and conform closely to the federal tax base. Add in the revenues from existing state sales taxes and the combined federal and state sales tax rate would climb to 45 percent. Suppose the tax base were reduced by onethird from the pure consumption tax proposed. In light of all the preferences in the current income tax and the exemptions in state sales taxes this is probably not an unreasonable assumption. It would come about for example if just food and health were exempted or if just government expenditures were exempted. Cutting the base like this would raise the required rate to 67 percent. Since a sales tax would likely raise prices nominal government expenditures on goods and services consumed by government and on transfer payments would have to rise to hold constant the inflationadjusted effects of government policy. This could add another 10 percentage points to the required tax rate. Any transition relief provided to households would reduce the tax base and raise the required rate further. For example the ST plan would make payments to those on fixed annuity incomes to account for any increase in prices. Economic growth could reduce the required tax rate but as discussed below probably not by very much. And if saving rises following the implementation of a sales tax consumption would have to fall which would reduce the tax base and raise the required tax rate further. The clear result then is that any realistic sales tax plan would have tax rates much higher than the 23 percent rate promised by the AFT. Sales taxes at such high rates raise crucial questions about enforceability. Tax simplicity and tax enforcement should be analyzed together any tax can be simple if it is not enforced. If it could be enforced the sales taxes would be quite simple for the typical household but problems would arise for businesses. The likely rate of evasion in a sales tax is a key issue. Sales tax advocates admit that evasion would be a certainty yet make no account for it in their estimates and hope that sentiments of fairness will induce taxpayers not to cheat. They also point to low marginal tax rates as an inducement not to cheat but as shown above the tax rate would not likely be low. Another claim is that detection of cheating would rise dramatically since only retailers would have to be audited but this is misleading. Under the sales tax businesses that make retail sales would be responsible for sending tax payments to the government unless the buyer used a business exemption certificate in which case no tax would be due. But the buyer would have the legal responsibility for determining whether the good is used as a business input or a consumption item. This means that auditing and enforcement would have to focus not just on retailers but also on all businesses that purchase from retailers to ensure that business exemption certificates were used appropriately. One study found that in Florida where sales taxes have never exceeded 6 percent 5 percent of all purchases made with business exemption certificates were used inappropriately to exempt personal consumption from taxes. At the much higher tax rate needed in a federal sales tax a much larger percentage of sales to businesses might be expected to fall into this category. Most importantly the sales tax would generate tremendous opportunities for evasion. For example in the income tax the rate of evasion is around 15 percent. But income where taxes are withheld and reported to government by a third party has evasion rates of around 5 percent. For income where taxes are not withheld and there is no crossreporting evasion is around 50 percent. Since the sales tax would feature no withholding and no crossreporting the possibility of high evasion rates needs to be taken quite seriously. Advocates also assert that the sales tax would be more effective than the current system at raising revenue from the underground economy. The classic example is that of a drug dealer who currently does not pay income tax on the money he earns but would be forced to pay taxes under a sales tax if he took the drug money and bought for example a Mercedes. The problem with this argument is laid out best by Rep. Richard Armey RTexas If there is an income tax in place he the drug dealer won t report his income. If there is a sales tax in place he won t collect taxes from his customers and send the taxes to government. In the end neither system taxes the drug trade. Many other countries have attempted to implement a retail sales tax or variants and almost all have abandoned the tax and moved to a valueadded tax. Governments have gone on record as noting that at rates of more than 12 percent sales taxes are too easy to evade. The most optimistic assessment would be that there is no historical precedent for a country to enact a highrate enforceable national sales tax. That does not mean it is impossible but extreme caution would be appropriate. Finally some sales tax advocates would eliminate the IRS and have the states administer the tax. Even though the states would keep 1 percent of the revenue they collect they would have poor incentive to collect federal taxes adequately. Even the Wall Street Journal no fan of big government notes that it is fantasy to think of getting rid of the IRS.  For reasons of equity efficiency and simplicity establishing a broad tax base is a key element of sales tax proposals. The broader the base the lower the rate can be. As the income tax shows allowing specific exemptions creates a political slippery slope. Loopholes accorded to one group breed additional loopholes by fueling demand from other groups for equally favored treatment and by weakening congressional resolve to stem the tide of special requests. But taxing a broad base will be hard. Some items are quite difficult to tax like imputed financial services. Other items may not be taxed for reasons of social policy. Child credits rental payments and some or all food may fall into this category. Finally some sectors might not be taxed because of strong political influences housing and health for instance though exemptions here may also be related to social policy. These issues create serious tradeoffs. For example taxing health insurance would raise the number of uninsured by an estimated 6 million to 14 million people. Not taxing it would raise the sales tax rate by several points. Even with extreme political discipline in avoiding subsidies it will be difficult to tax more than 80 percent of personal consumption. Retaining some of the major preferences in the income tax could reduce the private consumption base to about 60 percent of personal consumption. The most controversial and interesting feature of the proposed sales tax base is the provision to tax all consumption and investment purchases made by the federal state and local governments. These provisions increase the tax base by more than 40 percent. But taxing government only helps keep the sales tax rate down when government is not allowed to raise the additional amount of revenues it collects to pay the tax. If this restriction takes effect real government spending would have to fall dramatically. Tax reform could increase economic growth in several ways. A broader tax base that eliminated loopholes would help direct assets and efforts to their most productive economic use. Lower tax rates would encourage working saving and investing and reduce incentives to avoid or evade taxes. Simpler taxes would reduce compliance costs. Changing the base from income to consumption would enhance the aftertax return to saving and investment. But growth projections also need to take into account transition relief. Consider a 65yearold who retires the day that a sales tax takes effect. While she worked her income exceeded her consumption and she paid income taxes. Now in retirement when her consumption will exceed income she will be asked to pay consumption taxes. Should she be given tax relief for consumption financed by drawing down her assets? Giving such people tax relief on their accumulated assets would raise the sales tax rate considerably and reduce growth but not giving tax relief seems unfair. Politically some sort of relief seems almost a certainty. Estimates suggest a wellfunctioning broadbased consumption tax with limited personal exemptions and limited transition relief could raise income per person by up to 2 percent over 10 years. But more generous transition relief or erosion of the tax base would drive the growth effects to zero fairly quickly. These results stand in sharp contrast to AFT s claims that after 10 years of a sales tax the typical American household would be at least 10 percent and probably 15 percent better off than they would have been otherwise. The issue of fairness in taxation is often contentious and always subjective. The sales tax would tax consumption at a flat rate compared to the current system which taxes income at progressive rates. Taxing consumption instead of income is often justified on grounds that consumption may be a better indicator of longrun ability to pay taxes since income varies significantly from year to year. But for people who face constraints on what they can borrow the long run may not be the most relevant time period. Clearly there is nothing inherently fair or unfair about having just a single rate. If households are classified by annual income the sales tax is sharply regressive. Under the AFT proposal taxes would rise for households in the bottom 90 percent of the income distribution while households in the top 1 percent would receive an average tax cut of over 75000. If households are classified by consumption level a somewhat different pattern emerges. Households in the bottom twothirds of the distribution would pay less than currently households in the top third would pay more. Still households at the very top would pay much less again receiving a tax cut of about 75000. There appears to be little sound motivation for heaping huge tax cuts on precisely the groups whose income and wealth have benefitted the most from recent events and raising burdens significantly on others. The proposed sales tax also contains potentially severe marriage penalties. Recall that the demogrant would equal the tax rate times the poverty line. The poverty line is 7890 for one person plus 2720 for each additional person. At a sales tax rate of 30 percent a conservative estimate two single people would be entitled to rebates of 2367 each for a total of 4734. If they married they would receive 3183 so their annual marriage penalty would be 1551. At higher rates the penalty would rise. Advocates like to assert that sales taxes are profamily relative to the income tax. However children and families benefit disproportionately from numerous features of the current system including dependent exemptions child credits child care credits earned income credits and education credits. And the preferential treatment of housing health insurance and state and local tax payments also plausibly helps families since they consume relatively more housing medical services and governmentprovided services such as education. All of these preferences would be eliminated under a sales tax. Moreover compared to childless couples families with kids generally have high consumption relative to income so switching from income tax to a consumption tax would further raise tax burdens during years when family needs were highest. Based on 1996 data a recent study found that enactment of a broadbased flatrate consumption tax like the sales tax or flat tax would hurt families with incomes less than 200000 because of the loss of tax preferences but would help families with income above 200000 due to the dramatic reduction in the top tax rate. Incorporating the 1997 tax changes especially the child and education credits would only exacerbate these results. As a replacement for the existing federal tax system a national retail sales tax is a nonstarter. After accounting for evasion the conversion of state and local taxes adjustments to keep government benefits constant and plausible reductions in the tax base the required rate would be sufficiently high to make enforcement too difficult and evasion too tempting. The historical record should suggest great caution in this regard. Even if the tax were enforceable at these rates the implied effects on economic growth would be small at best and certain sectors of the economy such as employerprovided health insurance could be affected significantly. The sales tax would raise burdens on low and middleincome households and sharply cut taxes on the top 1 percent. Opposition to the sales tax is not a partisan issue. Robert McIntyre of Citizens for Tax Justice decries the sales tax as unworkable. The Wall Street Journal calls the sales tax a VAT valueadded tax in drag and highlights concerns about administration and enforcement. Bruce Bartlett of the National Center for Policy Analysis concludes that the sales tax is a poor choice for replacing the tax system. Joel Slemrod of the University of Michigan pronounces the sales tax as NAUSEAI an acronym for not administrable at usual standards of equity and intrusiveness.  These problems with the sales tax do not imply that tax reform is a bad idea. Improvements to the tax system are sorely needed. Other types of consumption taxes like valueadded taxes or variants of the flat tax should receive careful consideration. Many of the gains of moving to a consumption tax could also be obtained through judicious modifications of the income tax. Since income tax reform may also generate much smaller transitional problems it should be considered seriously and first.

https://itep.org/sales-taxes-and-social-distancing-state-and-local-governments-may-face-their-steepest-sales-tax-decline-ever/, view  view  By Meg Wiehe and Carl Davis Last week the nation focused its attention on the debate over the 2 trillion federal relief package. The final package included critical aid for states and localities to invest in pressing needs related to COVID19. But this aid will not be enough in the short or long term to help states address sizable revenue shortfalls. It s too early to assess the full impact this pandemic will have on state and local revenues but to get ahead of the curve we should ask tough questions and explore solutions now. One pressing question is what will an economic downturn in which consumers are anxious facing job loss or simply spending their time sheltering in place and not spending money in typical ways mean for states ability to raise revenue? Retail establishments from clothing to home goods stores are shuttered until further notice. In many cities all restaurants are closed except a few able to offer food for carryout. People are buying fewer hotel stays and restaurant meals both items often taxed at a higher rate than other services or goods. Services that are taxed from yoga studios to gyms and other activities are halted. In addition to the downward pressure on consumer spending that accompanies any economic downturn the current pandemic also may be reshuffling the ways in which people spend money into categories of consumption that are less likely to be subject to sales tax. For instance an increase in spending on health care groceries and digital streaming services during this period of social distancing may not help offset revenue decline since some of these categories of spending are often exempt from sales tax. Early indications are that consumers are cutting back or spending much less due to personal economic uncertainty. Even people who still have jobs may substantially cut back their spending because there are limited ways for them to spend their money. Moreover as consumers shift some of their shopping online sales tax revenue is not captured as consistently as it is at brick and mortar retailers because some states have yet to set up broad requirements for sales tax collection by eretailers. This will have sweeping ramifications for most states budgets especially those that raise most of their revenue from sales and excise taxes. In a typical economic downturn sales and other consumption taxes are among the first revenue sources to suffer as consumers begin cutting back on spending. Of course there s nothing typical about our current situation. But there s every reason to think this pattern will hold this time around and may even be more pronounced than usual. Clearly this will be harsh for state and local budgets particularly those that rely more heavily on sales tax revenue. ITEP s most recent Who Pays? report finds that Florida Nevada Tennessee Texas South Dakota and Washington derive roughly half to twothirds of their tax revenue from sales and excise taxes compared to the national average of 35 percent. We ve written extensively about why over reliance on sales taxes is bad policy. Foremost sales taxes are regressive. ITEP estimates that lowincome families typically spend threequarters of their income out of necessity on salestaxable items while middleincome families spend about half and upperincome families spend roughly onesixth. This contributes to income inequality prevents states from raising more from higherincome households and gives a pass to those who can pay more. Given the nature of our current crisis states may seek to plug holes in their sales tax bases created by outdated laws that fail to apply tax to 21stcentury goods and services such as digital downloads streaming and online services. Doing so is overdue. But while sales tax reforms have a role to play they are not the best path forward for closing yawning state revenue gaps. At a time when so many Americans are facing economic uncertainty or even disaster the first place states should look to address revenue shortfalls is their highestincome residents taxpayers managing to earn substantial incomes this year even in the midst of our current economic upheaval. Raising personal income taxes on top earners is the most straightforward means of generating tax revenue without worsening economic hardship. Many states did so during the last recession and they should do so again. Crises expose existing weaknesses. It s abundantly clear at this moment that our public health infrastructure needs shoring up and our education system needs the tools to provide equal education to all children in the classroom or remotely. And these systemic weaknesses are just the tip of the iceberg. Fundamental longterm policy change is hard to navigate in the middle of a crisis. But in the short and long term states should take a hard look at how they are raising revenue and who they are requiring to pay more. ITEP analysts recently wrote about what states can do now to address fiscal challenges brought on by the COVID19 crisis.

In this installment of Academic Perspectives on SALT the authors explore the general case for why states should consider expanding their sales tax bases to more services as a response to the fiscal challenges of the COVID19 crisis. States are facing a severe budget crisis as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. And with the federal government unlikely to pass a relief bill to address those state budget issues1 states will need to play a significant role in making up revenue shortfalls. This is the first in a threepart series which is a contribution to Project SAFE State Action in Fiscal Emergencies. This essay will lay out the general case for why states should consider expanding their sales tax bases to more services as a response to the COVID19 crisis. The followups will discuss further mechanics and details of how best to accomplish this goal. In particular the second essay will argue that there are lowhanging reforms that could raise substantial revenue would represent good tax policy and might be politically possible even during the current crisis. In the third essay we will then introduce reforms to help with the critical problem of tax pyramiding. States depend primarily on income and sales tax revenue to fund services including education and healthcare. COVID19 has decimated these revenue sources. Income tax revenue plunged because of the rise in unemployment and the sharp decline in retail sales was due to social distancing restrictions that prevent most retailers from operating at full capacity.2 Although it is impossible to predict the full effect of COVID19 on state budgets estimates indicate that states and localities will face shortfalls between 450 billion and 650 billion over the next two years with the higher end of those estimates being reached if a surge in COVID19 cases causes a doubledip recession.3 These estimates are somewhat smaller than forecasters projected during the height of the pandemic but still represent massive shortfalls especially in light of the expiration of federal aid programs and rising pandemicrelated state expenses.4 Because states generally operate under balanced budget requirements they either need to bring in more money or cut costs during a recession.5 The federal government which has more flexibility than states to borrow money and raise revenue provided 150 billion to the states through the Coronavirus Aid Relief and Economic Security Act P.L. 116136 in March. However that amount fell far short of filling the state budget gaps.6 Since March Congress has considered several bills to provide additional funding to states but the House and Senate have been at a political impasse thanks to contrasting views as to what a relief package should include.7 Given the recent elections and continued division in Congress new federal aid will almost certainly fail to make up for state budget shortfalls even if additional relief is approved.8 It therefore seems inevitable that over the next few years states will need to play a significant role in closing their budget gaps by raising taxes cutting expenses or some combination of the two. During a recession states primarily balance their budgets by reducing spending rather than raising taxes as evidenced by the extensive state budget cuts to education health and social services during the Great Recession.9 Unfortunately these cuts tend to slow economic recovery and shrink states safety net for vulnerable residents when state services are needed most.10 Despite the harmful ramifications of budget cuts during a recession states have responded to the current recession by reducing spending including for essential state services and they will have to make deeper spending cuts over the next few years unless they raise additional revenue.11 For example Medicaid which is funded by a mix of state and federal dollars represents an important share of state spending12 and enrollments tend to rise during an economic downturn. But with revenue streams now pinched many states have enacted or proposed bills to cut state Medicaid funding despite a projected rise in enrollments through 2021.13 The same is true for education Since the start of the pandemic approximately half of states have cut education funding despite the increase in COVID19related costs borne by schools for example personal protective equipment facility cleaning virus testing and distance learning costs.14 This is troubling because remote and hybrid learning is particularly difficult for vulnerable populations yet education funding cuts tend to disproportionately affect poorer school districts.15 To limit the harmful consequences of cuts to education healthcare and other important programs states should rely more heavily on tax increases during this recession than they have in the past.16 Some options include raising income taxes on the wealthy modifying statutory balancedbudget rules decoupling from the federal base imposing new statelevel taxes and expanding the state sales tax bases.17 This series will focus on just one of those options broadening the state sales tax base to services.18 We do not believe that states should rely on expanding the sales tax alone rather we think that this sensible reform should be part of the revenue mix that the states use to counter the crisis. In particular given how the crisis has disproportionately hurt the already vulnerable taxing on the basis of ability to pay or wealth seems appropriate. Further states should and in many cases could borrow and therefore we do not believe that revenue increases need to make up for the entire shortfall.19 If the states make wise basebroadening reforms then they should be able to borrow the funds they need to avert the most destructive cuts. There are several arguments to support the expansion of state sales tax bases to services. In 2020 the most pressing reason is that taxing services would significantly increase revenue in most states.20 For example when Utah attempted to expand its retail sales tax base to all services by default in 2019 state auditors estimated the legislation would bring in an additional 230 million in 2020.21 In 2017 Illinois estimated that it could raise close to 3 billion more per year if it taxed the same services that are taxable in Iowa which taxes a relatively broad range of services.22 And North Carolina which added several services to its tax base in 2016 estimated that the change raised at least 84.8 million more in sales tax revenue in the first year.23 Since each state includes a different mix of transactions in its sales tax base economists and policymakers have found it difficult to make concrete projections about how much revenue a broad services tax would raise if all states were to add consumer services to their tax bases. At least one estimate though places the potential annual nationwide revenue yield from taxing all services purchased by households in the tens of billions.24 COVID19related budget shortfalls could provide the political impetus for expanding states sales tax bases much as collapsing revenues during the Great Depression led to states adopting general retail sales taxes in the first place.25 But beyond the revenue potential taxing services makes substantive policy sense too. First expanding the base would help modernize state sales taxes.26 When states first enacted sales taxes the purpose was to capture consumer spending.27 Because at that time consumers spent much more on goods than services states were able to tax most consumer spending by taxing the sale of goods but excluding all but a few services.28 Since the mid20th century consumer spending has shifted toward services and away from goods.29 Sales of goods may have been a workable albeit imperfect sales tax base in 1950 when services only accounted for 39 percent of personal consumption.30 Today however services account for 69 percent of consumer spending31 meaning that most state sales taxes are based on the economy as it existed nearly a century ago. It is further worth noting on this point that the U.S. tax system as whole considering both the state and federal levels dramatically undertaxed spending as compared with every other developed nation.32 This is because every other developed nation raises a large portion of its overall revenue from a value added tax.33 By contrast the United States levies neither a value added tax nor any substantial tax on spending and U.S. state sales taxes are much smaller in both scope and magnitude as compared with other nations VATs.34 Second a tax on services could help eliminate the current arbitrary distinctions between closely related consumer goods and services which may distort consumer choices by artificially making service transactions less expensive.35 For example if purchasing a lawn mower with a useful life of four years and hiring a lawn care service over that same period each cost 400 before sales tax and only the lawn mower purchase is taxable the fact that the latter is taxed makes it more expensive relative to the cost of the lawn care service. A general maxim of tax policy is that broadbased taxes are superior at minimizing economic distortions. Expanding state sales taxes to services would broaden their base and enhance their efficiency. Indeed the arbitrary sales tax distinction between goods and services in a sense results in higher taxes on goods because the items that remain in the tax base must bear the full brunt of the sales tax revenue burden.36 Adding services to their sales tax bases allows states to lower their overall average sales tax rates perhaps after state finances recover from the pandemic which would reduce the price of goods and services already subject to tax without decreasing overall sales tax revenue.37 Of course all consumption taxes raise significant design concerns. First business inputs should generally remain untaxed.38 When business inputs are taxed businesses raise retail prices to cover sales taxes paid on transactions during production a concept often referred to as tax pyramiding that is a tax on a tax.39 This is especially problematic in the sales tax context in which there may be many levels involved in production processes. To address this issue the third essay in this series will evaluate options for credits deductions or exclusions for businesstobusiness purchases so that services can be incorporated into the sales tax base without exacerbating tax pyramiding concerns. Another concern is that sales taxes like other consumption taxes are generally regressive because they are imposed at a flat rate and lowerincome taxpayers spend a greater portion of their income on goods and services.40 But this concern is likely to be more than offset by the progressivity of how revenues are spent. Because most major categories of state spending benefit lowincome populations the overall result of funding incremental spending or preventing cuts through an expanded sales tax base is in fact progressive.41 Overall the benefits of taxing consumer services for both policy and revenue reasons are important enough that through thoughtful design state legislatures can largely avoid the problems that taxing services might otherwise raise. Especially in this time of severe revenue needs the modernization of state sales taxes via broader bases is overdue. In the two planned followups in this series we will explain how best to accomplish this. 1 Alexis Gravely Smaller COVID19 Relief More Likely as Dems Underperform in Election Tax Notes Federal Nov. 9 2020 p. 982. 2 See Michael Leachman and Elizabeth McNichol Pandemic s Impact on State Revenues Less Than Earlier Expected but Still Severe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities Oct. 30 2020 showing estimates by Moody s Analytics of shortfalls totaling 450 billion to 650 billion and explaining their own estimates of shortfalls totaling 480 billion to 620 billion Kate Davidson and David Harrison CoronavirusHit State Budgets Create a Drag on U.S. Recovery The Wall Street Journal Aug. 12 2020 and Nelson D.

They may therefore include tax revenue from items that policymakers and scholars generally agree should not be in the base.

https://www.ncsl.org/resources/details/what-happens-when-states-ditch-income-tax-for-sales-tax,  Besides permanent tax exemptions many states also offer temporary sales tax holidays for certain purchases commonly clothing footwear school supplies and computers. Since emerging from the pandemicfueled economic downturn state budgets have been flush with cash and lawmakers across the country have enacted a historic amount of income tax relief. At least 20 states have cut personal or corporate income tax rates or both since the start of 2021 reducing revenues by hundreds of millions or in several cases billions of dollars annually. Going into 2023 the push to cut income taxes does not appear to be over. Governors in several states Nebraska North Dakota and West Virginia for example have proposed reducing income taxes or even eliminating them. Eliminating the income tax is a highly contentious proposition. Replacing the average state s most productive revenue stream could lead to budget instability and would increase the regressivity of the overall tax system. Those with lower incomes typically spend about threequarters of their earnings on items that are subject to sales tax whereas top earners spend about a sixth of their income on taxed items. To the extent that states continue to reduce income taxes more reliance inevitably will fall on sales taxes the secondlargest state revenue source. Some economists who favor the sales tax say that taxing consumption is less economically distortive and more conducive to growth than taxing income. However states wishing to transition from income toward consumption taxation will eventually need to reckon with longstanding issues facing the sustainability of state sales taxes which have not kept pace with changes in the economy and have gradually eroded over time. While sales tax collections have been strong over the last two years because of increased spending on durable goods sales revenue growth was slow or flat in many states in the years leading up to the pandemic. Going into 2023 with many states forecasting slower revenue growth sales tax revenues may become particularly sluggish. Because of persistent high inflation we are seeing substantial weakness in sales tax revenues as consumers are recognizing the toll of higher prices according to the Urban Institute s analysis of monthly state revenues. For tax policy purists the ideal sales tax would fall on all final consumption but state sales taxes are far from having such breadth. In fact a growing number of consumer purchases are not subject to sales tax in most states. Many have excluded the purchase of services and digital goods from tax and many provide exemptions and holidays for other specified purchases. According to the Tax Foundation the average sales tax breadth or share of a state economy included in the sales tax base was 29.71 in fiscal year 2021. This represents the lowest point in a consistent downward trend over the past several decades the mean sales tax breadth was 49 in 1970. As a result of the narrowing of state sales tax bases statutory rates have gradually increased. The median state sales tax rate was 3.25 in 1970 4.0 in 1980 5 in 1990 through 2000 and is at 6 today. Rising tax rates are not the only consequence of a narrow tax base weakened revenues increased budget instability and questions about tax fairness could become increasingly salient issues if sales tax base erosion is left unaddressed. When the first state sales taxes emerged in response to dire state and local revenue needs during the Great Depression tangible goods accounted for most of personal consumption. Most states chose not to apply sales tax to services because they would be more difficult to administer and such exemptions weren t nearly as expensive. Today services account for about 70 of all personal consumption and most of those transactions are not subject to sales tax. The Federation of Tax Administrators has periodically surveyed states on the extent to which they tax services. The group s 2017 survey its most recent found that only five states Delaware Hawaii New Mexico South Dakota and Washington taxed a significant majority of 176 specified services. A handful of services such as cellphone or electric and gas utility services are taxed by most states but most are not. Professional and personal services such as legal or accounting services hair dressing and tax preparation are rarely taxed. The digital era has also eroded the sales tax base. Many tangible objects such as books are being replaced by intangible digital versions and about half the states still do not tax digital products or streaming services. It is estimated that states could gain tens of billions of dollars in additional revenue if services were taxed broadly. States often estimate tens to hundreds of millions in new revenue from taxing digital goods as well. Furthermore maintaining taxes on some purchases but not others can create clear competitive advantages for certain digital or servicebased industries. In some cases it could incentivize retailers that sell both taxable goods and nontaxable services to attribute a greater portion of a given bundled transaction to a nontaxable service. While some disagreement still exists about whether certain services should be taxed most tax policy analysts agree that states would do well to include more of them in their tax base. But there is a long list of states that have tried and failed to do so in comprehensive fashion. The Council on State Taxation has noted that over the last 30 years about onequarter of the sales tax states tried to enact sweeping sales tax reform that would extend the sales tax base to cover all or most services. In several instances opposition from affected industries and public resistance to tax increases has resulted in states repealing new sales tax reform laws just days after enacting them. Rather than try to tax services in one fell swoop several states have been adding more services to the tax base in piecemeal fashion often as part of legislation that provides relief in other areas. This year Kentucky approved taxes on over 30 new services as part of a larger measure that reduced income tax rates. Connecticut and Iowa undertook similar modest expansions in 2018 and 19. In addition to excluding services and digital goods from the tax base many states also exempt commonly purchased items such as food or prescription medicines. These exemptions are typically adopted to reduce the regressivity of sales taxes as those with lower incomes will need to devote a larger share of their income to meet their food needs. Still such exemptions can be quite costly. Most states Georgia and Iowa offer recent examples estimate that tax exemptions for groceries annually cost hundreds of millions of dollars or more. Besides permanent tax exemptions many states also provide temporary sales tax holidays for certain purchases commonly clothing footwear school supplies and computers. Tax policy experts from both ends of the political spectrum have cast doubt on tax holiday proponents arguments and lament there is no good policy justification for treating certain transactions made at certain times differently than others. The evidence suggests such holidays merely shift the timing of consumer purchases and do not increase the amount people spend. Nevertheless 20 states held at least one sales tax holiday in 2022 and such programs are generally anticipated to cost tens of millions in revenue. While sales taxes do not apply to many purchases one might expect they would they do apply to transactions economists argue should be exempt. Specifically business inputs office computers utensils used by restaurant customers building materials etc. often are taxable. Because these are costs of production rather than consumption and often do not reflect the final consumer economists generally discourage their taxation on the grounds that they create distortions and inefficiencies. Business purchases account for about 42 of total state sales tax revenues the collections are about three times higher than state corporate income taxes. These sales taxes can be built into a product s final selling price which unbeknownst to consumers makes the effective tax rate higher than the advertised statutory retail tax rate. This is a challenge for state tax modernization efforts. There are regular calls to provide increased exemptions or tax credits for certain business purchases but doing so would further erode the sales tax base. Dissatisfaction with taxing business inputs has also hampered the policy goal of extending the sales tax to include services as doing so would mean many additional businesstobusiness purchases of services could be included in the tax base. While many business purchases are subject to sales tax exemptions for business inputs are not uncommon. For example many states exempt manufacturing equipment or machinery used in agriculture production. A typical case would be a manufacturer receiving a sales tax exemption for the purchase of a tangible product that is incorporated into a manufactured good. Some question whether the exemptions states have adopted for business inputs are merited. For example exemptions for rental car businesses which generally don t pay sales taxes on fleet vehicles are estimated by some states to cost tens of millions of dollars in lost revenue annually see examples from Illinois and Maryland. But whether these purchases are truly business inputs is not clear since rental car companies do not resell the cars or use them to produce other goods and services. Notably legislative history in several states shows that adopting a separate excise tax on rental car transactions usually imposed in addition to sales tax was a means of offsetting revenue lost to the vehicle sales tax exemptions. Massachusetts proposed legislation in 2022 to remove an exemption for vehicle purchases by rental car companies. If enacted the state would join Georgia North Dakota Hawaii and Oregon in applying sales tax to such purchases. The sales tax has many longstanding weaknesses and limitations. As states push forward with plans to rely more heavily on consumption taxes these issues will only become more pronounced. History however suggests states will have an uphill battle in effecting lasting reform. While 2023 seems ripe for sales tax modernization it may be that the status quo will continue to reign supreme.
