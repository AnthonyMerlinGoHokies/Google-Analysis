By Corine Lesnes San Francisco United States correspondent   Time to 3 min.   During a protest by National Homelessness Law Center activists outside the US Supreme Court Washington DC on April 22 2024. SAUL LOEB AFP Could the US Supreme Court help solve the homelessness crisis on the West Coast? Thats the hope of the regions major cities from Los Angeles to Seattle via Portland Denver Phoenix and San Francisco which have been overwhelmed in recent years by an influx of people camping out on their streets. These municipalities all Democratic are usually critical of the conservativemajority Supreme Courts decisions. This time theyre counting on the justices to give them back the authority to ban sleeping in public spaces which was stripped from them by a previous court ruling. On Monday April 22 the Supreme Court considered their petition meanwhile outside National Homelessness Law Center activists sat on the asphalt with signs reading Housing not handcuffs! The dispute regards the legality of a series of anticamping rulings passed in 2013 by Grants Pass Oregon population 40000. The municipality wanted to prohibit tents or sleeping bags in public places with fines of up to 300 281 and arrests if the fines are not paid. In 2018 three people punished through this measure filed a complaint citing the lack of places in the citys only shelter the Gospel Rescue Mission a 138place religious establishment where one of the admission requirements is to attend church services. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals whose jurisdiction covers nine Western states ruled in their favor. It ruled that the bans and fines imposed on people without access to a shelter were contrary to the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The same court had previously invoked the amendment in 2006 to protect homeless people on Los Angeles Skid Row and then in 2018 to overturn anticamping ordinances issued by Boise Idaho. In 2019 the Supreme Court refused to take up Idahos case. This year as residents and business owners in Western cities grow increasingly fed up with the number of homeless people in their neighborhoods it has agreed to consider Grants Pass appeal against the Court of Appeals. According to experts the majority of judges seemed to side with the cities argument. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts and the conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked why their institution was being deemed more suitable for judging decisions affecting local populations than the municipalities themselves. The three liberal justices on the other hand criticized Grants Pass attempt to criminalize certain basic human needs. Sleeping is a biological necessity said Judge Elena Kagan. For a homeless person who has no place to go sleeping in public is kind of like breathing in public. You have 42.06 of this article left to read. The rest is for subscribers only.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/21/politics/supreme-court-debate-cities-punish-homeless/index.html,  Advocates hand out supplies to the unhoused community at Morrison Park in Grants Pass Oregon on March 28 2024. Melina MaraThe Washington PostGetty ImagesFile CNN When Helen Cruz pitched her tent in a city park a few years ago and made it her home she chose the location for one reason She wanted to be close to the houses she cleans for a living but could never afford for herself.   People see the irony of it said Cruz 49. I never looked at it like that.   What Cruz didn t realize then was that living in a park in Grants Pass Oregon would place her in the middle of a national debate that will reach the Supreme Court on Monday about whether cities can respond to a spike in homelessness by punishing homeless people.   Supreme Court Police officers stand on the steps of the Supreme Court on April 16 in Washington DC. Kent NishimuraGetty Images Related article Supreme Court makes it easier to sue employers for job transfers   In the most significant appeal involving unhoused Americans to reach the high court in decades the justices will hear arguments Monday on whether ticketing people who live on the streets is cruel and unusual and violates the Eighth Amendment.   The case is being watched closely by city and state officials who are uncertain how to respond to a surge in homelessness and encampments that have cropped up under bridges and in city parks across the nation. It s also being followed by people who live in those encampments and are alarmed by efforts to criminalize the population rather than build shelters and affordable housing.   Nobody wants to be out here said Cruz who has since moved into a church where she also serves as a caretaker. We know the parks are for family and children. The thing is we have no place to go. There s no housing.   Between 2022 and 2023 the number of people experiencing homelessness increased 12 according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development report in December.   On any given night that study found more than 650000 people in the United States are unhoused including roughly 40 without adequate shelter.   Grants Pass a city of 38000 people in southern Oregon responded by intensifying enforcement of anticamping ordinances that bar people from sleeping in public with bedding which can include sleeping bags or bundledup clothing. The city says the prohibitions apply to everyone not just the unhoused.   Critics say the only people pitching tents on sidewalks are homeless.   The debate about whether the ordinances apply to a class of people or to prohibited conduct will feature prominently Monday. A 1962 Supreme Court decision found that a California law that criminalized drug addiction as opposed to drug possession amounted to a cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment.   I can see where the policymakers are coming from. I just think that it s so broad to say we re going ticket you for just simply existing said Mary Ferrell executive director of the Maslow Project a nonprofit that works with homeless children in Grants Pass. The sense on the ground is that the city just doesn t want people experiencing homelessness period.   City officials argue the Eighth Amendment s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment was aimed at torture or hard labor sentences imposed by 18th century kings not tickets handed out by police. Homelessness they say is a challenge in terms of public safety and health not a constitutional matter for courts to decide.   The solution lawyers for Grants Pass told the Supreme Court is not to stretch the Eighth Amendment beyond its limits and place the federal courts in charge of this pressing social problem.   A Grants Pass police officer checks on a homeless person after relatives asked for a welfare check at Fruitdale Park on March 23 2024. Jenny KaneAPFile The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against the city holding that it could not enforce its anticamping ordinances against homeless persons for the mere act of sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements or for sleeping in their car at night when there was no other place in the city for them to go.   A 2019 study found 602 people who were homeless in Grants Pass and another 1045 individuals who were precariously housed according to the plaintiffs. Meanwhile the city has extremely limited shelter space.   There is no difficulty in determining that the people who were living outside in Grants Pass were doing so because they had nowhere else to go said Ed Johnson at the Oregon Law Center who represents the plaintiffs.   The case has put some government leaders in a delicate position. California Gov. Gavin Newsom a Democrat told the high court last month that people experiencing homelessness shouldn t be criminalized but he also warned the justices against a broad ruling that could tie the hands of government in dealing with encampments.   There is no compassion in stepping over people in the streets and there is no dignity in allowing people to die in dangerous fireprone encampments Newsom told the court in a brief that sided with neither side.   The Biden administration has tried to walk a fine line too. It is urging the Supreme Court to block Grants Pass from effectively criminalizing the status of homelessness but it also suggests the matter should be returned to a lower court for a casebycase analysis of whether the individual people ticketed in fact had nowhere else to sleep.   Cruz described receiving so many tickets that she s still struggling to pay them off more than a year after she moved out of the park. She d receive a ticket she said and then have to pick up her belongings and move. Each violation of the ordinances carries a 295 fine which increases to more than 500 if not paid.   After two tickets police can order a person to avoid a park for 30 days. Anyone who violates that order can be sentenced to 30 days in jail.   For Cruz the ticketing felt like harassment an effort to nudge people experiencing homelessness out of the Grants Pass entirely.   But she said I m not going anywhere. And I m not gonna let anybody push me out.

Experience moments of joy. CapRadio A man named Frank sits in his tent with a river view in Portland Ore. in 2021. A lawsuit originally filed in 2018 on behalf of homeless people in the Oregon city of Grants Pass is set to go before the U.S. Supreme Court in April. By Jennifer Ludden NPR In April the U.S. Supreme Court will hear a major case that could reshape how cities manage homelessness. The legal issue is whether they can fine or arrest people for sleeping outside if theres no shelter available. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has deemed this cruel and unusual punishment and this case is a pivotal challenge to that ruling. The high court declined to take up a similar case in 2019. But since then homelessness rates have climbed relentlessly. Street encampments have grown larger and have expanded to new places igniting intense backlash from residents and businesses. Homelessness and the lack of affordable housing thats helping to drive it have become key issues for many voters. The case Grants Pass v. Johnson could have dramatic implications for the record number of people living in tents and cars across the United States. In the small city of Grants Pass Ore. homeless people say the city broke the law when it aggressively tried to push them out over the past decade. To discourage people from sleeping in public spaces the city banned the use of stoves and sleeping bags or other bedding. But during several years when she had lost housing Helen Cruz says she needed to live in city parks because theyre close to the jobs she had cleaning houses. Were not out there because we want to be she says. We dont have a choice. Theres no place to go. Grants Pass has no homeless shelter thats open to everyone. A religious mission takes in a few who agree to attend services. That left Cruz racking up thousands of dollars in fines which she remains unable to pay. And I keep getting mail from Josephine County court saying You owe this. If you dont pay this its going to collections she says which has destroyed my credit. A lawsuit originally filed in 2018 on behalf of homeless people in Grants Pass said the situation there was part of a larger crisis as homelessness rates around the U.S. were high and growing. It accused the city of trying to punish people based on their status of being involuntarily homeless. The 9th Circuit agreed saying the city could not ban people from sleeping outside with rudimentary protection from the elements when there was nowhere else for them to go. The same appeals court also sided with homeless people in a landmark 2018 case out of Boise Idaho which the Supreme Court later declined to take up. Critics say the Grants Pass ruling is a major expansion over the Boise one since it forbids not just criminal penalties but civil ones. Advocates for homeless people dont see much difference since some in Grants Pass who couldnt pay their fines were eventually jailed. Grants Pass petitioned the Supreme Court. And its appeal has drawn support from dozens of local and state officials across the West and elsewhere who urged the justices to take this case. Among those filing such friendofthecourt briefs are Republicanled states like Idaho Montana and Nebraska and Democraticled cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco plus a separate brief from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. States and cities contend these rulings have contributed to the growth of tent encampments. These decisions are legally wrong and have tied the hands of local governments as they work to address the urgent homelessness crisis Theane Evangelis the attorney representing Grants Pass said in a statement. The tragedy is that these decisions are actually harming the very people they purport to protect. Evangelis and others say sprawling tent camps pose a threat to public health and safety. Those living in them often face theft or assault and are at risk of being hit by passing vehicles. And they note that encampments have led to fires disease environmental hazards and high numbers of people overdosing on drugs and dying on public streets. Its just gone too far California Gov. Gavin Newsom said last year at a Politico event in Sacramento. Peoples lives are at risk. Its unacceptable whats happening on the streets and sidewalks. Compassion is not stepping over people on the streets. Critics also say the 9th Circuits rulings are ambiguous and have been interpreted too broadly making them unworkable in practice. We need to have clarity says Seattle City Attorney Ann Davison who wrote a legal brief on behalf of more than a dozen other cities plus the National League of Cities. For example what exactly constitutes adequate shelter? And what about when a bed is open but someone refuses to go? Local officials say that this happens a lot and some acknowledge that people might have good reasons to not want to go to a shelter. Yet Davison says court rulings essentially require cities to build enough shelter for every person without housing something many places cant possibly afford. They also argue that homelessness is a complex problem that requires balancing competing interests something local officials are better equipped to do than the courts. We are trying to show theres respect for the public areas that we all need to have Davison says. And we care for people and were engaging and being involved in the longterm solution for them. Attorneys and advocates for the homeless plaintiffs argue that the 9th Circuit rulings are far narrower and less restrictive than cities claim. Its interesting to me that the people in power have thrown up their hands and said Theres nothing we can do and the only solution we can think of is to arrest people says Jesse Rabinowitz of the National Homelessness Law Center. Thats simply not true. He and others say the rulings do allow cities to regulate encampments. They can limit the time and place for them ban the use of tents even clear them out. And plenty of cities do that though they often face lawsuits over the details of whats allowed. Grants Pass did whats not allowed which is ban camps everywhere all the time says Ed Johnson of the Oregon Law Center which represents those suing the city. He says that would basically make it illegal for people to exist. Its sort of the bare minimum in what a just society should expect is that youre not going to punish someone for something they have no ability to control he says. The reason they cant control being homeless Johnson says is because Grants Pass like so many cities around the U.S. has a severe housing shortage and unaffordable rents. He says that cities are blaming the courts for decades of failed housing policies and that fining and jailing people only makes the problem worse. When we criminalize people we know it impacts their ability to get a job says Ann Oliva CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. It impacts their ability to get housing in the long run if they have a criminal record. Some cities that side with Grants Pass say they have invested heavily to create more affordable housing even as homelessness rates keep going up. Thats a longterm challenge theyll still face whatever the Supreme Court decides. CapRadio provides a trusted source of news because of you.

Jenny KaneAP hide caption   A group of volunteers check on homeless people living in a park in Grants Pass Ore. on March 21. In a major case on homelessness the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday appeared to side with an Oregon citys crackdown on sleeping in public. The decision could have sweeping implications for the record number of people living in tents and cars and the cities and states struggling to manage them. The Supreme Court had declined to hear a similar case out of Boise Idaho in 2019. But since then rates of homelessness have spiked. An annual federal count found more than 250000 people living in parks on streets and in their vehicles. Sprawling street encampments have grown larger and expanded to new places igniting intense backlash from residents and businesses. The current case centers on the small city of Grants Pass Ore. which has a population just under 40000 and is a symbol of just how widespread the homelessness problem has become. A slew of other cities and states led by Democrats and Republicans alike urged the justices to take up this issue. In both the Boise and Grants Pass cases lower courts said that under the Eighth Amendment its cruel and unusual to fine or jail someone for sleeping on public land if theres no adequate shelter available. But Grants Pass and many other cities across the West say those rulings have tied their hands as they try to keep their public spaces open and safe for everyone. During Mondays arguments the Supreme Courts more liberal justices suggested this amounts to unlawfully targeting people simply because theyre homeless. You dont arrest babies who have blankets over them. You dont arrest people who are sleeping on the beach said Justice Sotomayor.  Justice Kagan said sleeping is not a criminal act. Sleeping is a biological necessity. Its sort of like breathing. ... But I wouldnt expect you to criminalize breathing in public. But the courts conservative justices said it can be hard to draw the line between someones conduct which can be legally punished and a status they are unable to change which cannot be punished. How about if there are no public bathroom facilities? Justice Gorsuch asked. Do people have an Eighth Amendment right to defecate and urinate? Is that conduct or is that status? Over and over conservative justices also said homelessness is a complex policy problem and questioned whether courts like theirs should micromanage it. Why would you think that these nine people are the best people to judge and weigh those policy judgments? Chief Justice Roberts asked.

Jenny KaneAP hide caption   Demonstrators rally outside City Hall in Grants Pass Ore. on March 20. The selfproclaimed park watch group opposes public drug use in homeless encampments. States and cities across the U.S. have struggled to manage record rates of homelessness. Some in the West have found ways to limit encampments and even clear them out without running afoul of the 9th Circuit rulings. Elsewhere several states have taken a more sweeping approach with camping bans. Floridas governor recently signed a law that seeks to move unhoused people off public property altogether and into governmentrun encampments. Some worry that a decision in favor of Grants Pass will lead to more such moves or even a worstcase scenario of a banishment race if communities seek to push people out of their jurisdiction. Justice Sotomayor raised that concern during the arguments.  Where do we put them if every city every village every town lacks compassion? she said. That shortage has pushed rents to levels many cannot afford which advocates say is a main driver of rising homelessness. Even where places are investing heavily to create more affordable housing it will take a while to catch up. This Supreme Court case wont solve any of that but it could dramatically shape the lives of those forced to live on streets parks and back alleys for years to come. Become an NPR sponsor
https://www.nlc.org/article/2024/01/29/cities-dont-give-up-on-the-fight-to-end-homelessness/, When the work of homelessness makes you feel hopeless don t give up and don t give in to calls for harsh action that punishes people who have nowhere else to go. Pause. Then use the failure of our systems as fuel to power your fight against homelessness. Homelessness is preventable and solvable. I regularly visit cities and towns that are successfully helping people stay in their homes or move into new homes after living without one. But progress can be slow and that progress is often slower when we react too quickly. Mayors local officials and city leaders in every department have long been under pressure to do something anything and the recent rise in homelessness has intensified that pressure. With severe shortages of affordable housing rents rising faster than wages and a pandemic that worsened the health outcomes or so many communities are understandably struggling with how to help. One reaction is to pass laws that make it illegal for people to lie down sleep or camp in public spaces. Yet criminalizing homelessness simply shuffles people between streets and jails when their only true offense is not making rent. This worsens rather than solves the problem. Real change can take time especially when decadesold systems are what need to change. To solve homelessness we must fix systems that contribute not blame people failed by them. Housing is the fundamental solution to homelessness. We must increase the number of homes in this country and make them more affordable. When fulltime minimum wage workers many of whom are working while homeless can t afford rent in any county in the country the system is broken. But housing alone is not enough. We must make wraparound services accessible to everyone who needs them. It is these supports like medical and mental health care substance use treatment childcare transportation and support to recover from traumatic events that can help people stay housed. We also have to go upstream. We must stop releasing patients from hospitals and kids from foster care when they have no home to go to. We must acknowledge that racism is alive and well in this nation driving high rates of homelessness for people of color. We must design more equitable policies and institutions. Homelessness is a policy choice. Our nation s response to COVID19 demonstrated that. During the height of the pandemic the nation came together and chose to invest more in housing health care and income supports to prevent people from losing homes. The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act provided the singlelargest investment in addressing homelessness in American history. Cities used that money to build more affordable housing convert vacant hotels and motels into shelters where people could socially distance create emergency rental assistance and eviction prevention systems and provide the first housing voucher for people experiencing homelessness. More than 100 cities joined the federal House America Initiative to end homelessness for more than 100000 people and create more than 40000 affordable homes. These collective efforts helped halt the post2016 rise in homelessness and prevented another rise between 2020 and 2022. Source Center on Budget and Policy PrioritiesThis showed that progress is possible even in difficult times. Unfortunately now that most of the pandemic resources have expired we re reminded of what happens when we don t invest enough in what works housing and support. In December 2022 the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness released All In The Federal Strategy to Prevent and End Homelessness. Since then the BidenHarris administration has taken major unprecedented action to address homelessness headon. In 2023 In the coming year we will build on our work to expand housing break down barriers and help even more people escape homelessness. Even when more tents appear we know it doesn t mean that communities aren t helping people. Data show that for every person who moves off the street and into a home more than one becomes homeless. That s why preventing homelessness is a priority for the federal government. In the last three years we showed the promise of eviction prevention resources providing more rental assistance than in the previous 20 years. Last year we deepened our work to help communities build better systems to prevent homelessness especially among youth. This year we are exploring publicprivate partnerships to prevent homelessness from occurring in the first place. There is so much more work to be done and we can t do it without you. Cities and towns and the people who lead them are critical to solving homelessness nationally. You have the power to update local landuse and zoning policies making it easier and faster to build or convert housing connected to the needs of your residents. You have the power to protect renters and incentivize landlords to accept people using vouchers. You have the power to make sure no one ends up in jail simply because they can t afford rent. We need you your mayors city councilors municipal employees landlords developers and others to make the choice to effectively and humanely respond to homelessness. Like air water and food housing is a basic human need required for the health of individuals and communities. Until housing is available to all don t give up.

https://stateline.org/2024/01/03/as-homeless-people-become-more-visible-some-cities-and-states-take-a-tougher-line/,  A homeless man occupies a Chicago bus shelter. As the homeless population has grown and become more visible many cities and states have moved from a focus on the rights of homeless people to the rights of local residents and businesses. Charles Rex ArbogastThe Associated Press In pushing for a bill of rights for homeless Michiganders Democratic state Rep. Emily Dievendorf encountered a cruel irony A homeless constituent providing advice on the measure was denied entry to the state Capitol because he didn t have a photo ID. Under Dievendorf s bill homeless people in Michigan would have the right to move freely in parks on sidewalks and in other public spaces and could not be denied employment for lacking a permanent address. They also would be guaranteed emergency medical care privacy protections for their personal belongings and access to the official documentation required to cast a vote in Michigan in other words a photo ID.  As a society we have to admit that it takes time for folks who are struggling and don t have a roof over their head to stabilize themselves while they wait for housing opportunities to happen said Dievendorf. This bill is about a baseline of humanity and respect that we should give humans who are unhoused.  Connecticut Illinois and Rhode Island have similar measures on the books. And this past summer New York City became the first city in the nation to pass a homeless bill of rights. It includes the right to shelter the right to sleep outside and the right to vote. But the state laws were enacted a decade ago and homeless advocates say they are often ignored. In the years since efforts to pass bill of rights measures in at least a halfdozen other states have fallen short. In New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams is fighting to suspend the city s separate 4decadeold righttoshelter policy under which it has to provide temporary housing for every homeless person. Dievendorf s bill introduced last year hasn t advanced out of committee in Michigan s Democraticdominated legislature. This bill is about a baseline of humanity and respect that we should give humans who are unhoused.  Michigan Democratic state Rep. Emily Dievendorf As the homeless population has grown and become more visible many cities and states have pivoted from a focus on the rights of homeless people to the rights of local residents and businesses that are being forced to contend with homeless encampments and other fallout from the nation s shortage of affordable housing. In the past two years Missouri Tennessee and Texas have approved statewide camping bans on public property though the Missouri Supreme Court last month struck down that state s law over a technical issue. In Georgia a new law requires cities and counties to enforce existing bans on public camping steers money toward transitional housing that requires drug treatment encourages the creation of sanctioned camping areas and calls for a performance audit of spending on programs for homeless people. San Diego and Portland Oregon recently tightened their camping restrictions. And San Diego has joined leftleaning cities including Albuquerque New Mexico Honolulu Las Vegas Milwaukee St. Paul Minnesota and Seattle in asking the U.S. Supreme Court to give them more authority to dismantle homeless encampments.  The friction in many communities affected by homelessness is at a breaking point those and other cities wrote in an amicus brief supporting Grants Pass Oregon which was sued by three unhoused residents who argued the city shouldn t be allowed to punish them for sleeping in public when there is nowhere else for them to go.  Despite massive infusions of public resources businesses and residents are suffering the increasingly negative effects of longterm urban camping the brief continues. Among them enormous volumes of garbage human waste and other health hazards like used needles.  Grants Pass is appealing a 2020 district court ruling that its ordinances regulating homelessness are unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court could decide this month whether to take the case. A pointintime count released last month by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found that about 653100 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023 up 12 compared with 2022. Sixty percent of those people were in emergency shelters transitional housing or other sheltered situations while the remainder were on the streets or in places not meant for human habitation.  The number of homeless people has spiked since the COVID19 pandemic but city efforts to crack down on camping loitering and panhandling predate the public health crisis. Between 2006 and 2019 there was a sharp increase in the number of citywide bans on camping up 92 sitting or lying in public spaces 78 loitering 103 panhandling 103 and living in vehicles 213 according to a 2021 report by the National Homelessness Law Center. The group also tracked a 1300 increase in the number of homeless encampments and noted that Black and Native American people are overrepresented in the homeless population.  That was my home   Even in Rhode Island one of the three states that have a homeless bill of rights advocates say authorities often ignore the law in their zeal to get homeless people off the streets. Providence is one of the cities asking the Supreme Court for more authority to clear encampments.  A bill of rights law without enforcement has no teeth said Juan Espinoza communications and development manager for the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness. It s especially dangerous when the individuals who are supposed to benefit from the law are disconnected and unaware of what rights they may have just because they lack a stable home.  The National Homelessness Law Center and other advocacy groups argue that state and local policies that criminalize homelessness only make the problem worse.  Because people experiencing homelessness are not on the street by choice but because they lack choices criminal and civil punishment serves no constructive purpose the report states. Instead arrests unaffordable tickets and the collateral consequences of criminal convictions make it more difficult for people to exit homelessness and get back on their feet.  Steve Berg chief policy officer for the National Alliance to End Homelessness said he expects more cities and states to take a punitive approach this year.  We re worried about states implementing criminalization and fines as a way to address homelessness when there s evidence that it doesn t work Berg said in an interview with Stateline. We ve seen these laws challenged in court and our belief is that due process would prohibit that kind of criminalization.  Instead advocates argue the solution to homelessness is more housing and behavioral health services for the many unhoused people who are struggling with mental illness or substance use. But even many progressives argue that housing and services must be combined with enforcement. In a separate amicus brief supporting Grants Pass the leftleaning California State Association of Counties and the League of California Cities point to the billions of dollars public officials have spent on supportive services outreach teams emergency shelters rental subsidies microdwellings and safe camping sites with 24hour security bathrooms and storage. It hasn t been enough.  Homelessness in California is a complex problem with many root causes and it demands a comprehensive solution they argue in the brief. Enforcing camping restrictions they say is a critical component to the overall wellbeing of the community.  In August Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom used stronger language in criticizing a court order barring San Francisco from clearing homeless encampments calling it preposterous and inhumane.   People are moving out of the cities. Businesses are shutting down. People are dying of overdoses because of this Newsom told the San Francisco Chronicle. Ultimately everyone s going to blame me for everything. But damn it they need to be accountable as well. These judges are wrong on these overriding sweeping orders.  In conservative states with recently enacted camping bans legislators have relied on model legislation drafted by the Cicero Institute a Texasbased think tank founded by Joe Lonsdale the cofounder of tech firm Palantir and managing partner at the venture capital firm 8VC. The new Georgia law is the most farreaching. It goes beyond a camping ban by steering the state away from the housing first strategy embraced by many advocates. Under that approach people experiencing homelessness are provided with free permanent housing first before they receive help with mental health issues substance use or job placement. Lonsdale and other critics say that given the high percentage of homeless people experiencing those problems housing first usually fails. The law also takes aim at what Lonsdale and other critics refer to as the Homeless Industrial Complex or the array of homelessservice providers that they argue benefit from the status quo. Under the Georgia law the state will examine the awarding of contracts and grants to service providers to determine whether they are meeting metrics of success. I find it laughable when some people say that its better to leave someone on the street because we know where we can find them to help them later.  Bryan Sunderland executive director of policy at the Cicero Institute Bryan Sunderland executive director of policy at the Cicero Institute said the group isn t advocating the criminalization of homelessness. Rather it is trying to prevent the worst outcomes of street homelessness.  I find it laughable when some people say that it s better to leave someone on the street because we know where we can find them to help them later Sunderland said in an interview with Stateline.  It boggles the mind and I don t want to impugn anyone s motivations but the folks that often make those arguments are the ones that are collecting millions of dollars from the federal government to continue running the nonprofits that they run.  In pushing for a homeless bill of rights in Michigan Dievendorf is resurrecting legislation that died in 2016 and 2017. Lisa Chapman policy director for the Michigan Coalition Against Homelessness said it s unfortunate that a bill to give homeless people basic rights is even necessary. A person s housing status shouldn t dictate whether they are protected under the law she told Stateline.  The bill is aspirational Chapman said. Of course we want everyone to have the same rights. But in reality people experiencing homelessness aren t being treated equally and there have been cities in the state responding to rising homelessness with criminalization.  Homeless Camping Bans Are Spreading. This Group Shaped the Bills.  She also cited the increasing use in Michigan of socalled hostile architecture on city benches to physically prevent people from sleeping on them. In July the Grand Rapids City Commission approved two ordinances designed to crack down on street homelessness. The first bars loitering in public or private buildings including doorways and prohibits accosting another person who is using an ATM waiting at a bus stop or eating or drinking outdoors. The second ordinance prohibits the storage of unattended or excess personal property in public rightsofway and parks and allows the city to impound such property without prior notice. The ACLU of Michigan criticized both measures as unconstitutional.  The proposed amendments criminalize behaviors fundamental to the experience of being unhoused keeping personal property in public using tents and spending time loitering in public places the ACLU wrote in a letter to Democratic Mayor Rosalynn Bliss and the other members of the commission.  This approach only pushes our unhoused neighbors further into the margins of society exacerbating their struggles. Indeed we fear that may be the goal because it is uncomfortable to be confronted with the reality that others have so much less.  by Robbie Sequeira Stateline January 3 2024 by Robbie Sequeira Stateline January 3 2024 In pushing for a bill of rights for homeless Michiganders Democratic state Rep. Emily Dievendorf encountered a cruel irony A homeless constituent providing advice on the measure was denied entry to the state Capitol because he didn t have a photo ID. Under Dievendorf s bill homeless people in Michigan would have the right to move freely in parks on sidewalks and in other public spaces and could not be denied employment for lacking a permanent address. They also would be guaranteed emergency medical care privacy protections for their personal belongings and access to the official documentation required to cast a vote in Michigan in other words a photo ID.  As a society we have to admit that it takes time for folks who are struggling and don t have a roof over their head to stabilize themselves while they wait for housing opportunities to happen said Dievendorf. This bill is about a baseline of humanity and respect that we should give humans who are unhoused.  Connecticut Illinois and Rhode Island have similar measures on the books. And this past summer New York City became the first city in the nation to pass a homeless bill of rights. It includes the right to shelter the right to sleep outside and the right to vote. But the state laws were enacted a decade ago and homeless advocates say they are often ignored. In the years since efforts to pass bill of rights measures in at least a halfdozen other states have fallen short. In New York City Democratic Mayor Eric Adams is fighting to suspend the city s separate 4decadeold righttoshelter policy under which it has to provide temporary housing for every homeless person. Dievendorf s bill introduced last year hasn t advanced out of committee in Michigan s Democraticdominated legislature.  Michigan Democratic state Rep. Emily Dievendorf As the homeless population has grown and become more visible many cities and states have pivoted from a focus on the rights of homeless people to the rights of local residents and businesses that are being forced to contend with homeless encampments and other fallout from the nation s shortage of affordable housing. In the past two years Missouri Tennessee and Texas have approved statewide camping bans on public property though the Missouri Supreme Court last month struck down that state s law over a technical issue. In Georgia a new law requires cities and counties to enforce existing bans on public camping steers money toward transitional housing that requires drug treatment encourages the creation of sanctioned camping areas and calls for a performance audit of spending on programs for homeless people. San Diego and Portland Oregon recently tightened their camping restrictions. And San Diego has joined leftleaning cities including Albuquerque New Mexico Honolulu Las Vegas Milwaukee St. Paul Minnesota and Seattle in asking the U.S. Supreme Court to give them more authority to dismantle homeless encampments.  The friction in many communities affected by homelessness is at a breaking point those and other cities wrote in an amicus brief supporting Grants Pass Oregon which was sued by three unhoused residents who argued the city shouldn t be allowed to punish them for sleeping in public when there is nowhere else for them to go.  Despite massive infusions of public resources businesses and residents are suffering the increasingly negative effects of longterm urban camping the brief continues. Among them enormous volumes of garbage human waste and other health hazards like used needles.  Grants Pass is appealing a 2020 district court ruling that its ordinances regulating homelessness are unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court could decide this month whether to take the case. A pointintime count released last month by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development found that about 653100 people were experiencing homelessness on a single night in January 2023 up 12 compared with 2022. Sixty percent of those people were in emergency shelters transitional housing or other sheltered situations while the remainder were on the streets or in places not meant for human habitation.  The number of homeless people has spiked since the COVID19 pandemic but city efforts to crack down on camping loitering and panhandling predate the public health crisis. Between 2006 and 2019 there was a sharp increase in the number of citywide bans on camping up 92 sitting or lying in public spaces 78 loitering 103 panhandling 103 and living in vehicles 213 according to a 2021 report by the National Homelessness Law Center. The group also tracked a 1300 increase in the number of homeless encampments and noted that Black and Native American people are overrepresented in the homeless population.  That was my home   Even in Rhode Island one of the three states that have a homeless bill of rights advocates say authorities often ignore the law in their zeal to get homeless people off the streets. Providence is one of the cities asking the Supreme Court for more authority to clear encampments.  A bill of rights law without enforcement has no teeth said Juan Espinoza communications and development manager for the Rhode Island Coalition to End Homelessness. It s especially dangerous when the individuals who are supposed to benefit from the law are disconnected and unaware of what rights they may have just because they lack a stable home.  The National Homelessness Law Center and other advocacy groups argue that state and local policies that criminalize homelessness only make the problem worse.  Because people experiencing homelessness are not on the street by choice but because they lack choices criminal and civil punishment serves no constructive purpose the report states. Instead arrests unaffordable tickets and the collateral consequences of criminal convictions make it more difficult for people to exit homelessness and get back on their feet.  Steve Berg chief policy officer for the National Alliance to End Homelessness said he expects more cities and states to take a punitive approach this year.  We re worried about states implementing criminalization and fines as a way to address homelessness when there s evidence that it doesn t work Berg said in an interview with Stateline.

Updated on Fri March 29 2024 by the USAFacts Team About 653104 Americans were experiencing homelessness in January 2023 according to Department of Housing and Urban Development HUD data. HUD divides the US into 381 Continuums of Care CoC which are responsible for coordinating homelessness services in their area. These regions can be a city a city and county such as Spokane County in Washington which includes the city of Spokane or a group of rural areas. In 2023 49 CoCs included major cities 58 were largely urban but without a major city 165 were largely suburban and 109 were largely rural. About 53 of the nation s homeless people lived in the CoCs containing the 50 biggest cities. Out of the CoCs containing the 50 largest cities in the US the largest homeless populations were in the CoCs containing New York 88025 and Los Angeles 71320 which were also the largest cities by total population. The populations represented by each CoC depend on the specific areas they cover and CoC population data is not directly available through government agencies. New York City CoC for example represents the five boroughs of New York City which in 2022 had a population of 8.3 million people. Los Angeles City and County CoC includes 85 of the 88 cities in Los Angeles County all except Long Beach Pasadena and Glendale. Together these areas had a population of approximately 8.9 million people in 2022. Based on these figures the New York City CoC had 106 homeless people per 10000 residents and Los Angeles City and County CoC had 78. In 2023 46 of the 49 majorcity CoCs identified at least 1000 homeless individuals each. However people experience homelessness differently in each location. For example 27 of LA s homeless population was sheltered meaning people were living in an emergency shelter transitional housing or safe haven program. In New York this figure was 95. The five CoCs with the highest proportion of unsheltered homeless people were in California San JoseSanta Clara Los Angeles OaklandBerkeley Long Beach and Sacramento. Boston New York City and Baltimore had the highest proportion of sheltered homeless people each over 93. Given that homelessness counts occur during January cities with colder climates tend to have higher proportions of sheltered people. Unbiased datadriven insights in your inbox each week Fewer people stayed in shelters from 2020 to 2022 likely due to reduced pandemic capacity. By 2023 many of those shelters had returned to full capacity. While the number of unsheltered homeless people rose by 9.7 from 2022 to 2023 the number in shelters increased by 13.7. In January 2023 60.7 of homeless Americans lived in shelters. Despite these shifts the ranking of cities with the highest numbers of homeless people has largely remained consistent with prepandemic levels. Communities count sheltered and unsheltered homeless people separately. Sheltered people are counted based on information from homeless services such as emergency shelters and transitional housing. Every January each locality conducts a pointintime count of unsheltered people an unduplicated count on a single night of the homeless people in a locality. Every locality conducts its pointintime count differently but most cities make estimates based on a random sample of locations where homeless people are known to congregate. In 2023 all but seven of the participating CoCs executed their counts in late January.
