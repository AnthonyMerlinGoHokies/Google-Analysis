https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/15/japan-streptococcal-infections-rise-details, Health officials racing to identify cause of rise in streptococcal toxic shock syndrome which has a 30 fatality rate The number of cases in 2024 is expected to exceed last year s record numbers while concern is growing that the harshest and potentially deadly form of group A streptococcal disease streptococcal toxic shock syndrome STSS will continue to spread after the presence of highly virulent and infectious strains were confirmed in Japan. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases NIID said There are still many unknown factors regarding the mechanisms behind fulminant severe and sudden forms of streptococcus and we are not at the stage where we can explain them.  Provisional figures released by the NIID recorded 941 cases of STSS were reported last year. In the first two months of 2024 378 cases have already been recorded with infections identified in all but two of Japan s 47 prefectures. Most cases of STSS are caused by a bacterium called streptococcus pyogenes. More commonly known as strep A it can cause sore throats mainly in children and lots of people have it without knowing it and do not become ill. But the highly contagious bacteria that cause the infection can in some cases cause serious illnesses health complications and death particularly in adults over 30. About 30 of STSS cases are fatal. Older people can experience coldlike symptoms but in rare cases the symptoms can worsen to include strep throat tonsillitis pneumonia and meningitis. In the most serious cases it can lead to organ failure and necrosis. Some experts believe the rapid rise in cases last year were connected to the lifting of restrictions imposed during the coronavirus pandemic. In May 2023 the government downgraded Covid19 s status from class two which includes tuberculosis and Sars to class five placing it on a legal par with seasonal flu. The change meant local authorities were no longer able to order infected people to stay away from work or to recommend hospitalisation. The move also prompted people to lower their guard in a country where widespread mask wearing hand sanitising and avoiding the three Cs were credited with keeping Covid19 deaths comparatively low. About 73000 Covid19 deaths were recorded compared with more than 220000 in Britain which has a population just over half that of Japan. Ken Kikuchi a professor of infectious diseases at Tokyo Women s Medical University says he is very concerned about the dramatic rise this year in the number of patients with severe invasive streptococcal infections. He believes the reclassification of Covid19 was the most important factor behind the increase in streptococcus pyogenes infections. This he added had led more people to abandon basic measures to prevent infections such as regular hand disinfection.  In my opinion over 50 Japanese people have been infected by SarsCoV2 the virus that causes Covid19 Kikuchi tells the Guardian. People s immunological status after recovering from Covid19 might alter their susceptibility to some microorganisms. We need to clarify the infection cycle of severe invasive streptococcal pyogenes diseases and get them under control immediately.  Streptococcal infections like those of Covid19 are spread through droplets and physical contact. The bacterium can also infect patients through wounds on the hands and feet. Strep A infections are treated with antibiotics but patients with the more severe invasive group A streptococcal disease are likely to need a combination of antibiotics and other drugs along with intensive medical attention. Japan s health ministry recommends that people take the same basic hygiene precautions against strep A that became a part of everyday life during the coronavirus pandemic.  We want people to take preventive steps such as keeping your fingers and hands clean and exercising cough etiquette the health minister Keizo Takemi told reporters earlier this year according to the Japan Times.,
https://www.machiya-inn-japan.com/blog/when-is-the-best-time-to-visit-japan/, When is the best time to visit Japan? It s a question we hear often and there is no singular answer. The best time to go to Japan depends on a combination of factors including personal travel preferences and local events such as festivals and holidays. But Japan is a great travel destination all year round regardless of the season as you ll always be able to find something interesting to do.  If you would rather bypass the crowds and enjoy a calmer vacation though you need to know when Japan s national holidays occur. Understanding the best places to visit will help you plan your perfect Japanese adventure too. In this post you ll find out when the major national holidays take place in 2024 as well as some of the best times to visit Japan.  Why visit Japan in 2024? Besides the obvious answers of of great food beautiful views and unique culture 2024 is bringing an update to Shinkansen bullet train travel here in Japan! A new extension of the Hokuriku Shinkansen became available to travelers on March 16th connecting Kanazawa city Ishikawa Prefecture to Tsuruga Fukui Prefecture. For those planning to travel from Tokyo to Kanazawa city or even further you now have the option to go by Shinkansen making your travels convenient and much quicker.  As another bonus we are seeing efforts made to lessen crowding and provide a smoother travel experience on bullet trains in 2024. After efforts during the New Years holidays met success all seats on the Nozomi superexpress trains have become reserved seating during Golden Week Obon and winter holidays for foreseable future. The Nozomi is the fastest shinkansen bullet train running between Tokyo Station and Hakata Station. Shinkansen trains have nonreserved cars for ticket holders who do not reserve seats but in an effort to lessen crowding in stations during the busiest travel times in Japan they have made all Nozomi cars reserved seating for the holidays. Other bullet trains during the holidays like Hikari and Kodama will still offer nonreserved seating. Depending on which days National Holidays fall on in Japan can greatly change the timing and lengths of breaks for Japanese locals. You don t need to get out a calendar though! The local staff here at MACHIYA INNS HOTELS have rounded up the major National Holidays in Japan for 2024 that you should be aware of when deciding on when to travel. Golden Week encompasses four national holidays in Japan   Showa Day April 29 Constitution Day May 3 Greenery Day May 4 Children s Day May 5 Most Japanese locals will be away from work between May 3 and 6. Many people will however choose to make this a longer holiday and start their time off on April 29 instead. Add the weekend prior and the period between April 27 and May 6 become the peak travel days for Japanese locals.  Locals tend to leave busy urban areas primarily Tokyo during Golden Week so public transportation can be busy. Popular tourist attractions also can be more crowded. Although the Golden Week period can be busy the weather is mild making it the perfect time to enjoy outdoor activities in Japan. There are a couple things you can keep in mind to keep your travels during this time as smooth as possible if you plan on visiting Japan in early May. First be sure to book accommodations transport and activities well in advance. Second if possible avoid public transportations and choose to do local activities close to your accommodation. The Obon festival also called Bon festival signify for most of Japan the period between August 13 and 16 in 2024. Each year this Buddhist event allows the Japanese to commemorate their ancestors their spirits are believed to return for a brief period enabling them to see their loved ones again.  In addition to the Obon period between August 13 and 16 11 is also a national holiday. As 11 falls on a Sunday this year the following Monday 12 has been designated a national holiday. Many companies and schools will set the period between August 10 and August 16 as the summer obon break. Many Japanese will choose to travel during this time either for leisure or to go back to their hometown to see family during the Obon festival. Some choose to also use their vacation days in addition to the designated break period making their total break 9 days long from August 10to August 18. If you re planning to visit Japan during summer and want to try to avoid the crowds as much as possible be aware of this period as we are likely to see more Japanese local travelers between these dates. Obon although a popular travel season for Japanese locals also makes a great time to visit Japan for international travelers as well. There are many festivals held throughout the various regions of Japan during Obon making it great way to experience Japanese culture and tradition. Daimonji Festival in Kyoto is one of the most famous events to take place during the Obon festival. During this festival also known as Gozan no Okuribi 5 huge bonfires are set on the mountainsides of Kyoto shaped like specific Japanese characters. These are visible from the city making a fantastic memory of your Japan travels that would only be possible during the Obon period. Silver Week is a relatively new term in Japanese culture and refers to a number of holidays that fall consecutively during the month of September. While 2024 s Silver Week is not a long break there are two consecutive 3day weekends in September so it is still expected to be very busy with travelers. In 2024 September 1416 and 2123 are designated as 3day weekends. Although less common Japanese locals may choose to use their time off during the weekdays in between to extend their break with the longest period some may choose to take between September 14 to the 23. If you can only visit Japan during September 2024 consider arriving at the start or end of the month. If you do plan on traveling during Silver Week however be sure to secure your reservations for lodging and travels in advance! Silver Week is also when you can find some of the earliest fall foliage in Japan. Head up north to cooler prefectures like Hokkaido or areas in the mountainside like Hida Takayama City in Gifu prefecture to catch early autumn leaves towards the end of Silver Week. Japan celebrates Christmas like many other countries but focuses more on New Year s. Most businesses and banks will close at some point between December 28 2024 and January 5 2025. During the New Year period Japanese locals tend to visit their hometowns or family during this period. With that in mind be sure to check the operating hours and and days off of restaurants shops. and tourist attractions during this time! If you are visiting during the New Year s period we recommend stopping by a depachika the delicatessen floor of a highend department store to pick up a variety of side dishes bento boxes Japanese cuisine and enjoying a meal in your accommodation. Be sure to try osechi ryori or traditional Japanese New Year s food as it can be found in many depachika. Although shrines and temples can be busy during the New Year s it is also a great chance to experience the Japanese tradition of hatsumode . Hatsumode is the Japanese tradition of visiting a Buddhist temple or Shinto shrine to ring in the new year. Many shrines and temples will extend their opening hours to accommodate visitors. Major shrines like Yasaka Shrine in Kyoto City Japan and Oyama Shrine in Kanazawa City also offer various entertainments and have many food vendors and stalls for a festival like atmosphere. We the MACHIYA INNS HOTELS local staff have picked some of the best times to go to Japan across spring summer and winter. If you re looking to explore Japan and soak up the local culture without running into holiday crowds try to schedule your travels during the time periods listed below. If you would prefer to explore Japan during a quieter period May is one of the best months to visit Japan. But make sure you arrive after Golden Week which ends on May 6. Many Japanese locals take the whole of Golden Week off so streets and popular attractions will be less crowded immediately after.  Another reason why we recommend traveling to Japan in May? You ll enjoy pleasant weather before the heat and humidity of summer sets in. That can make a big difference if you want to explore without being slowed down by high temperatures. In addition to the great weather you may still be able to catch the late blooming cherry blossoms sakura in spots like Takayama City and its surrounding mountain area in during the time directly after Golden Week.  Some of the best spots in Takayama City located in Gifu Prefecture for appreciating cherry blossoms include  Miyagawa Ryokuchi Park Enakogawa River Nakabashi Bridge Shiroyama Park Cherry blossoms bloom late March to early April in most of Japan. Takayama City and the surrounding Hida area boast a longer time period from midApril to early May if the weather cooperates.  See our recommended accommodation in Takayama THE MACHIYA HOTEL TAKAYAMA While summer can be hot in Japan you can still find plenty of places to stay cool and enjoy your stay.  Kibune in Kyoto is a fantastic option if you re looking for a place to keep cool when visiting during the summer months. Kibune is a picturesque small mountain village to the north of Kyoto. Besides Kibune s temperature being around 10 degrees lower than in nearby Kyoto many restaurants here are built directly over the water making for an amazing experience during the summer. Enjoy a refreshing breeze and reazing views as you sample delicious Japanese food over the Kibune River! Another reason to visit Kibune is the Kifune Shrine dedicated to the god of water who is believed to have arrived in Kibune at this very spot. Be sure to try the omikuji or fortune here! Instead of just drawing your paper fortune you must place your omikuji paper inside the water here at Kifune Shrine to reveal your fortune. RELATED A Train Journey from Gion to Kifune Shrine in Kyoto Japan See our recommended accommodation in Kyoto MACHIYA RESIDENCE INN KYOTO If you love winter January or February will be the best month to visit Japan.  One of our favorite places to visit during the winter months is Kanazawa City in Ishikawa Prefecture. Famous for the fresh and delicious seafood you can dine on snow crab and other Japanese seafood only available during the winter while in Kanazawa. Kanazawa City is also home to some exquisite sights including the yukizuri in the legendary Kenrokuen Garden. The yukizuri are amazing conical structures made of rope designed to protect Kenrokuen s Karasaki pine trees from heavy snowfall which can damage their branches.  Another area to visit especially during the winter are the villages of Shirakawago and Gokayama a UNESCO World Heritage Site in an extraordinary mountainous area. This region was isolated from the world for many years and it retains a wonderfully traditional feel.  During winter this area is often blanketed by snow which is a sight you ll never forget. You can access these historic villages easily from Takayama City as well if you plan on visiting there as well!

The JapanAmerica Society of Washington DC At its 10th annual Japan in the Year conference the JapanAmerica Society of Washington DC partnered with the Wilson Center to discuss what s in store for the year ahead in Japan s foreign policy and domestic affairs. As the war in Ukraine continues and tensions in the Middle East persist 2024 will be a year that will be defined by uncertainties. Elections are scheduled across the world including Asia. As a result Japan s global leadership will be critical to ensure stability in an uncertain world. At the same time a stronger USJapan relationship will be at the heart of ensuring peace across the IndoPacific and to promote a rulesbased order in the region. Japan has emerged as a global leader on a wide range of key issues that transcend its own border from economic architecture to nonproliferation and climate change. It has furthered existing relations with the United States enhanced ties with Australia and taken significant steps to working together with South Korea and the United States for trilateral cooperation. Japan has emerged as a diplomatic powerhouse acting as a trusted partner to bridge the Middle East as well as Southeast Asia to complement Washington.  Still Prime Minister Fumio Kishida faces significant challenges at home not least economic management cabinet scandals and possibility of leadership change raise questions about whether Japan itself can enjoy the consistent leadership that may be required for Japan to realize its potential for global leadership at a time when it is greatly needed.

Lax hygiene measures following the Covid19 pandemic are thought to be contributing to the spread.   By Philippe Mesmer Tokyo Japan correspondent and Julien Lemaignen   Time to 4 min.   People wearing masks on a shopping street in central Osaka Japan on March 15 2024. RICHARD A. BROOKSAFP Japan is worried about the explosion in cases of the very serious streptococcal toxic shock syndrome STSS caused by group A streptococci GAS or pyogenic streptococci. The National Institute of Infectious Diseases NIID identified 422 cases between January 1 and March 17. This compares with 941 in 2023. 27 of the 47 Japanese departments are on red alert for this infection which has a mortality rate of over 30. The situation is all the more serious since in the summer of 2023 and for the first time in Japan authorities discovered a Group A Streptococcus GAS of the M1UK lineage more virulent and more transmissible the British strain the most common in Europe. Sometimes dubbed the flesheater the bacterium which many people carry without knowing it and without becoming ill can lead to infection of subcutaneous tissue and necrotizing fasciitis named after the fascia the tissue covering the muscles. This is followed by multiorgan failure including acute renal failure acute respiratory distress syndrome and disseminated intravascular coagulation DIC a coagulation abnormality that can lead to hemorrhage and thrombosis. All at a rapid rate. Onethird of people who develop the disease can die within 48 hours explained Ken Kikuchi an infectious disease specialist at Tokyo Womens Medical University who says he is very concerned about the increase in 2024. Patients who do not succumb to the disease can suffer severe consequences. In a report on January 22 TV Asahi cited the case of a man who felt pain in his leg after a day of playing basketball. His leg swelled becoming purplish in places and his temperature reached 40 C. He saw a doctor who did not run blood tests but prescribed antibiotics and fever medication. If the pain was too much I also had painkillers he said. A week later he was rushed to hospital after fainting Sepsis due to flesheating bacteria was diagnosed. His leg was amputated but he survived after a stay in intensive care. GAS is transmitted by aerosols. But the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that for nearly half of people with GAS experts dont know how the bacteria got into the body. Sometimes they enter through openings such as a wound or surgical incision. The bacteria can also enter through mucous membranes inside the nose and throat. The first symptoms of GAS are a sore throat fever diarrhea vomiting and severe fatigue. Risk factors include a weakened immune system and a chronic illness such as diabetes. There are still many things we dont know including why the bacterium becomes fulminant added Takashi Nakano an infectious disease expert at Kawasaki Medical School.
