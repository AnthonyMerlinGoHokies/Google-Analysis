College access is good for society but student loans are a complicated business  Share post in an email One thing most people can agree on when it comes to student debt is that earning a degree is the best way to secure a good job and middleclass lifestyle. That s one big reason why the federal government makes student loans they help people to earn those valuable degrees and become part of a strong American economy.  Generally speaking more people with an advanced education is a good thing for a country as a whole. This is because educated workers boost overall economic prosperity whether it s by starting their own companies or providing the skilled workers that are needed to produce breakthroughs in science medicine entertainment and other industries. In their personal lives educated workers also drive the economy by buying homes and having more money to spend on everything from groceries to vacations. Did you know? About nine out of every 10 student loans come from the federal government. Another reason that the federal government is the primary provider of student loans is that by and large student loans are a high risk business. College students rarely have an existing debt repayment history so they don t have a track record to prove they are reliable in terms of making payments which makes it hard for lenders to assess the risk of issuing a loan. If someone doesn t finish their degree or gets a poor quality education they are also likely to struggle to repay their loan. And unlike with a home mortgage or car loan there isn t any property tied to the loan that the lender could seize if they don t get their money back. For those reasons a private lender like a bank which has to make a profit to stay in business would most likely refuse a loan to many student borrowers or would set interest rates higher than students could reasonably repay. That means there would be fewer people going to college and fewer people with degrees which leaves the country worse off in the end. The government can offer all students loans if they need them and with lower interest rates and monthly payments because it does not have to earn a profit. To the extent that there are losses on these loans i.e. payments that are not made by borrowers that taxpayers must pay for most people generally agree they are worth it the return to society will be a good one. In recent years however some people have raised concerns about the payoff from a college education due to rising costs and student debt. Read more about that here. A resource from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation created with collaboration from the Center for American Progress CAP and the American Enterprise Institute AEI.
https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/x1ida5/cmv_the_government_should_get_out_of_the_student/,  I ve seen posts here about why we should or shouldn t cancel student loans or relieve a portion of them but not just about taking government loaning out of the equation.   It seems like government guaranteeing and lending out student loans has given colleges the blank check to increase college tuition prices   It encourages predatory colleges that don t supply their student group with useful majors that know they ll get their money regardless   It encourages kids to just do whatever their heart desires instead of what is financially responsible because they feel like they have a blank check from the government and don t necessarily understand debt.   It seems like a good solution to this would just be to privatize student loaning again with specific government projects for a select group of students who aren t going to major in traditionally lucrative albeit societally useful majors.   Students should be able to declare bankruptcy on these private loans. The loaners take out this risk and should assume it.   Loaners now have the liberty of deciding who they loan to depending on their intended major and previous educational grades projects etc. you are not guaranteed a student loan.   Government can keep some amount money to pay for amazing students to major in traditionally not lucrative majors in non STEM fields.   If your parents are loaded pay the price out of pocket and you can major in whatever you want even something not usefullucrative. In the end you ll just be transitioning money from someone not productive yourself to others that are majoring in more productive things which seems like a good thing.   It should eventually also lower costs of college and make sure people that go are majoring in societally beneficial and lucrative majors.   I understand that this system wouldn t be fair to children of low income families. No system ever is or has been in the modern world and the current system certainly isn t all saddling low income low earning major students with insurmountable debt with no guardrails to taking out that debt id argue this is even worse. But I fundamentally disagree with the notion that loaners WOULDN T loan to low income people. If you re a promising smart student who is going to major in law engineering or some other lucrative major I think the data would show that these are not risky loans regardless of your parents financial state. And especially won t be as risky when prices of schooling drops due to the privatization of loans.   I don t know the the solution is for the current debt crisis. I don t necessarily think a loan you agreed was unbankrupcyable should now be able to be dismissed but this is another topic entirely. I m thinking about the ideal state.   I understand the inbetween time transitioning from our current model to a private lender free market one would be painful. Schools would need to reorient lower costs remove unnecessary administrators increase class sizes target students who want to major in lucrative majors. Don t really know how this could be a soft landing.

Higher education provides students many socioeconomic benefits and increases the global competitiveness of the United States but mounting student loan debt has sparked a debate over federal lending policies. Advocates of student loan forgiveness protest outside the Supreme Court. Kent NishimuraLos Angeles TimesGetty Images Written By CFR.org Editors Updated Last updated April 16 2024 940 am EST Print Email Share Summary For decades the U.S. government has helped students finance their higher education to bolster the country s economic competitiveness and national security.U.S. student loan debt has ballooned in recent years outpacing most other forms of consumer borrowing.President Joe Biden has launched several plans to provide student debt relief but they have sparked intense opposition and legal challenges. IntroductionStudent loan debt in the United States has grown enormously in recent years and is now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing in the country. Though the benefits of a college education outweigh the costs in most cases many graduates are concerned about entering a weak job market and worry that lingering debt could hinder their financial futures.  Most economists see student loan programs as a sound investment in U.S. workers and essential for maintaining the country s competitive edge but questions remain about the appropriate level of federal involvement. A debate has also emerged over whether the government should forgive student loan debt and if so how much it should forgive. The Joe Biden administration has introduced several student debt forgiveness plans but its most sweeping proposal was struck down by the Supreme Court.  United States   Education   Renewing America   U.S. Economy   Competitiveness  Student debt has more than doubled over the last two decades. As of September 2023 fortythree million U.S. borrowers collectively owed more than 1.6 trillion in federal student loans. Adding private loans brings that amount above 1.7 trillion so that total student debt exceeds debt from auto loans and credit cards. Only home mortgage debt at more than 12 trillion is larger. Student debt is growing as more and more students attend college. In the late 1980s and early 1990s most high schoolers did not enroll at colleges or universities of those that did less than half borrowed money to do so. In 2022 almost twothirds of recent high school graduates were enrolled and most took out student loans.  The average student is also taking on more debt the balance per borrower rose 39 percent from 2008 to 2022 according to U.S. News World Report. Students are generally borrowing more because college tuition has grown many times faster than income. The cost of college and resulting debt is higher in the United States than in almost all other wealthy countries where higher education is often free or heavily subsidized. Meanwhile U.S. states pulled back funding for public universities and colleges in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Roughly one in five Americans holds student debt. Most students graduate with around 30000 in loans but a small portion of borrowers hold an outsize share of student debt. More than onethird of the total debt is held by the 7 percent of borrowers who owe more than 100000 according to the Washington Post. However borrowers with smaller amounts of debt often have a more difficult time repaying their loans as higher debt from graduate or professional degrees can pay off with much higher incomes. Students who do not complete their degrees often struggle the most their default rate is three times higher than those who graduate. Additionally the type of institution makes a difference in how much debt is owed. About half of outstanding student debt is held by people who went to private schools which enrolled just 23 percent of higher education students in 2021.   United States   Education   Renewing America   U.S. Economy   Competitiveness  There is also a racial disparity in student borrowing that many experts say is problematic and the result of decades of systemic discrimination. Black college students generally take on more debt than white students and they are more likely to struggle with loan repayment after graduating in part because they typically have lower levels of family wealth. Black Latinx and American Indian students are all more likely to default on their loans than white students. Most U.S. students have an incentive to borrow because higher education is typically required for the highestpaying jobs. A worker with a bachelor s degree earns 1.8 times the amount a person with a high school diploma does while those with doctorates or professional degrees earn more than double according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  However analysts caution that the return on investment in terms of future income can vary widely depending on factors including a student s major and the institution they attended. A 2019 study PDF by Federal Reserve economists found that although a college education still provides a boost in earnings the increase in wealth a degree provides has declined significantly over the past fifty years due to the rising cost of college and the increase in other forms of consumer debt. The U.S. government invests in higher education for its people through needbased tuition grants student loan programs veterans benefits and research grants because an educated and highly skilled workforce promotes national prosperity. Highly educated workers provide greater tax revenues are generally more productive and civically engaged and are less reliant on social programs. Moreover postsecondary education is seen by most experts as fundamental to a dynamic innovative economy. Major U.S. research universities such as Duke Harvard and Stanford often anchor regional innovation clusters. The federal government began taking a large role in funding higher education after World War II. The Servicemen s Readjustment Act of 1944 commonly known as the GI Bill provided tuition assistance and many other benefits including lowinterest home loans to nearly eight million returning veterans. The program continues to pay tuition for hundreds of thousands of servicemembers and veterans each year.  However federal student lending did not begin until the Cold War. In response to the Soviet Union s launch of Sputnik in 1957 Congress passed the National Defense Education Act sweeping legislation that created federally funded student loan programs and supported national security related fields including science math and foreign languages. In 1965 the Lyndon B. Johnson administration expanded federal involvement at all levels of education with the Higher Education Act HEA which laid the foundation for the current system of federal student lending. Since then Congress has passed laws that expand loan eligibility and allow parents to borrow on behalf of their children.  The federal government also provides needbased aid in the form of Pell Grants which were established in 1972 and students do not have to repay. But funding levels for the program have not kept pace with the rising cost of college resulting in more students turning to loans. The U.S. government used to guarantee or subsidize private loans through the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL program but critics including President Barack Obama argued that this was a handout to commercial lenders and the program was ended in 2010. All federal student loans have since been issued directly by the Department of Education.  In response to the COVID19 pandemic the Donald Trump administration provided tens of millions of student borrowers with temporary relief from making payments on their loans. In one of his first acts in office President Biden extended the payment moratorium for federal student loan borrowers until October 2021. He also expanded it to include private loans made under the discontinued FFEL program that are in default closing a loophole that affected more than one million borrowers. The Biden administration extended the freeze multiple times with the final extension expiring in October 2023. Since then only half of borrowers have resumed payments many of the remainder have defaulted or involuntary entered forbearance.  Some education finance experts say the increase in federal student lending is making college less affordable for many by allowing institutions to artificially inflate tuition. William J. Bennett the secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush argued in 1987 that federal aid was shielding colleges from market pressures allowing them to charge ever increasing prices. The socalled Bennett hypothesis continues to be debated by education experts. A 2014 study found that federal aid led to tuition increases only at private forprofit schools though other research PDF has established a link between aid and rising tuition at public schools as well. Many experts and policymakers agree that both the rising cost of college and the existing volume of loans need to be addressed. They acknowledge that surging student debt is harming younger generations of students by preventing them from reaching their financial goals while exacerbating racial inequality. While older generations were generally able to pay their way through school or find jobs that enabled them to pay off their debts that no longer holds true for recent cohorts they argue. The combination of soaring tuition costs and the recessions caused by the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID19 pandemic have particularly affected the millennial and subsequent generations. Additionally student loans are more difficult to discharge in bankruptcy than other forms of consumer debt such as from credit cards because borrowers are required to prove undue hardship from their loans in court. However experts and policymakers differ in their proposals for how to address the problem. The most recent debate has centered on the issue of loan cancellation some have called for universal loan cancellation in varying amounts while others say only targeted relief is warranted. Still other experts have proposed systemwide reforms beyond canceling existing debt.  Largescale debt cancellation. Universal debt relief calls for a blanket cancellation of all existing student loans. Other largescale plans call for forgiving up to 50000 for all borrowers. Proponents argue that largescale debt cancellation would help advance racial and socioeconomic equality and boost the economy. Without the burden of student loans they say more people will be able to buy homes take entrepreneurial risks or save for retirement. Opponents counter that broad cancellation would be unfair to those who successfully paid off their student loans or who avoided debt altogether. They also say it would disproportionately benefit highearning Americans such as doctors and lawyers who may have large debts but would likely not struggle with their payments. Another concern is who would bear the cost since the price tag is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars. Targeted debt relief. These plans would forgive most or all debt for borrowers who make under a certain income supporters of targeted relief often advocate for incomedriven repayment IDR plans. IDRs allow borrowers to pay an amount proportional to their income and have their remaining balance cleared after ten years assuming they ve made all qualifying payments. While proponents argue that targeting the lowestincome borrowers is the fairest approach critics say that it would do little to stop universities from raising tuition and other costs. Systemic reforms. A 2020 report by the Aspen Institute proposed systemwide reforms such as limiting tuition rates at pub lic colleges increasing aid for lowincome students incentivizing employers to offer tuition assistance and restricting federalloanfund distribution to institutions that have a history of low postgraduation employment rates and other poor outcomes for students. Policymakers are now increasing their efforts to treat student loans like any other consumer debt creating pathways to discharge student debt by filing for bankruptcy. Other experts and lawmakers say public funding should be increased to for example make public colleges and universities tuitionfree.  Some analysts say the perception that college is the only path to a wellpaying job drives up demand and harms students who could be better served by other forms of education. In recent years politicians from both major parties including former President Trump have advocated increasing access to career and technical education also known as vocational education as an alternative to college. Indeed enrollment in trade programs has increased since 2020 even as enrollment at two and fouryear public institutions is yet to recover from the pandemic. In 2022 Biden proposed a landmark executive order to cancel close to onethird of the federal government s student loan holding worth 441 billion. His plan would have forgiven up to 20000 in student debt for Pell Grant recipients and up to 10000 for non Pell Grant recipients making less than 125000 per year. The program was expected to help around forty million borrowers nearly half of whom would have had their entire debt forgiven. The estimated 400 billion outlay PDF drew fierce opposition from critics who viewed the program as an inflationary burden on taxpayers. In June 2023 the Supreme Court struck down the plan in a 63 vote ruling that the president did not have the statutory authority to cancel student loan debt.  In response Biden introduced a new scaleddown plan to reduce U.S. student loan debt which launched in August 2023. Under the socalled SAVE plan borrowers with undergraduate loans could see their monthly payments cut by as much as half with loan balances forgiven after ten or twenty years of payments depending on income level. The White House anticipates that the plan will allow borrowers to repay 0.71 per dollar borrowed though some analysts expect lower repayment rates. Projections of the program s cost vary but some place it even higher than that of the initial debt forgiveness plan. The Biden administration has estimated that it will cost 138 billion over the next ten years. Biden has also introduced a new process to forgive student loans outright for more than 30 million borrowers using authority from the HEA. As of April 2024 Biden has canceled a total of 153 billion in student debt for more than four million borrowers. Opponents raised concerns about the cost of the SAVE plan though experts say it stands on stronger legal footing than the previous debt forgiveness program. Critics also say that the new plan still burdens taxpayers and does little to reduce rapidly rising tuition costs. Some progressive lawmakers while applauding the plan say that it is not radical enough to fight the spiraling debt crisis. Meanwhile many analysts point out that any plan that aims to broadly cancel debt relief is likely to face legal challenges regardless of its legislative origin. To other experts student loan forgiveness would fail to address systemic issues. CFR s Roger W. Ferguson Jr. writes that such programs miss the fundamental weaknesses of higher education namely an unacceptably low completion rate overdependence on loans to attend college and high and rapidly increasing costs. He also pushes for upgrades to modernize the system used to manage student loans which he says could expedite both loan forgiveness and repayment saving borrowers up to 100 billion. Still proponents say IDRs such as SAVE are among the best options to reduce student debt. They argue that the Biden administration should now focus on reducing administrative hurdles to signing up for the program. A 2022 study by the Government Accountability Office found that thousands of borrowers who were eligible for forgiveness under existing IDRs were still making payments on their loans and that the Department of Education hasn t done enough to ensure that all eligible borrowers receive the forgiveness to which they are entitled.
