Putin won 87.3 of the vote on a record turnout of 77.5 the Central Election Commission CEC reported Monday after all the ballots from the threeday presidential vote were counted.   The result means Putin will rule until at least 2030 when he will be 77. Russia s longestserving leader since Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin he will secure a third full decade of rule.   With most opposition candidates either dead jailed exiled or barred from running and with dissent effectively outlawed in Russia since it launched its fullscale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 Putin faced no credible challenge to his rule.   The candidates allowed to oppose Putin were carefully curated by the Kremlin. His nearest rival Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party had won just 4.3 of the ballots counted.   Russian President Vladimir Putin speaks after polls closed in Moscow on March 18 2024. Maxim ShemetovReuters Related article Putin scores a resounding win but what s next for Russia?   The result was inevitable Putin s spokesman said last year that the vote was not really democracy but costly bureaucracy but the ritual of elections is nonetheless crucially important to the Kremlin as a means of confirming Putin s authority.   The ritual used to be held every four years before the law was changed in 2008 to extend presidential terms to six years. Later constitutional changes removed presidential term limits potentially allowing Putin to stay in power until 2036.   In a victory lap at his election headquarters late Sunday Putin said the election had consolidated national unity and that there were many tasks ahead for Russia as it continues its course of confrontation with the West.   No matter how hard anyone tries to frighten us whoever tries to suppress us our will our consciousness no one has ever managed to have done such a thing in history and it won t happen now and it won t happen in the future. Never he said.   Putin s fiercest opponents have died in recent months.   After leading a failed uprising in June Wagner mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed two months later after his plane crashed while traveling from Moscow to St. Petersburg. The Kremlin denied any involvement in Prigozhin s death.   The elections were held a month after Alexey Navalny Putin s most formidable opponent died in an Arctic penal colony. Navalny s family and supporters have accused Putin of being responsible for his death a claim rejected by the Kremlin.   In his Sunday evening address Putin made an unprecedented break with his tradition of not uttering Navalny s name discussing his death and confirming discussions over a potential prisoner swap involving the opposition figure. Navalny s allies had previously claimed he was days away from being exchanged before his death.   As for Mr. Navalny yes he passed away. It is always a sad event. And there were other cases when people in prisons passed away. Didn t this happen in the United States? It did and not once he said.   Putin said a few days before Navalny s death he was told of a proposal to exchange him for prisoners held in Western countries. The person who spoke to me had not finished his sentence yet when I said I agree Putin said. But unfortunately what happened Navalny s death happened. There was only one condition that we will exchange him for him not to come back. Let him sit there. Well such things happen. There s nothing you can do about it that s life.

Ebrahim NorooziAP Acts of defiance Navalny s widow Yulia Navalnaya had urged Russians to turn out collectively as a show of opposition on Sunday the final day of voting across Russia s 11 time zones and 88 federal subjects. In the runup the Kremlin warned against unsanctioned gatherings.   A CNN team in Moscow saw the line outside a polling station grow rapidly at midday as part of the socalled Noon Against Putin demonstrations inspired by Navalny. A woman waiting in line told CNN This is the first time in my life I have ever seen a queue for elections. Asked why she had come at that hour she replied You know why. I think everybody in this queue knows why.   Similar protests were staged at Russian embassies across Europe with large crowds gathering at noon in London Paris and elsewhere. Navalnaya attended a demonstration in Berlin waiting in line with other voters in a display of opposition.   The election was also marred by more graphic acts of defiance. As of Saturday Russia had filed at least 15 criminal cases after people poured dye in ballot boxes started fires or lobbed Molotov cocktails at polling stations. Ella Pamfilova the head of Russia s CEC said 29 polling stations across 20 regions in Russia were targeted including eight arson attempts.   More than 60 Russians were detained across at least 16 cities on the final day of voting according to independent human rights group OVDInfo.

AP Wartime election Russia also held the presidential election in four Ukrainian regions it annexed during its fullscale invasion. Ukraine said the elections violated international law and would be designated null and void.   Russianinstalled authorities in occupied Ukraine reported high turnout of more than 80. But evidence has emerged of voter coercion. Russian Telegram channels have shown Russian soldiers accompanying election officials as they go housetohouse to collect votes.   One video from Luhansk showed an elderly woman inside her apartment filling out an election paper and putting it in the ballot box while a man in army fatigues stands over her with a rifle slung across his chest.   After the release of preliminary results Sunday Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called Putin a dictator and Russia s election a sham.   It is clear to everyone in the world that this individual as has happened so often in history is simply sick with power and is doing everything he can to rule for life. There is no evil he will not commit to prolong his personal power. And there is no one in the world who is immune to this Zelensky said.   The election comes after more than two years of war which have exacted huge costs on the Russian population. The Kremlin keeps its casualty numbers shrouded in secrecy but Western officials believe more than 300000 Russian troops have been killed or injured on the battlefields of Ukraine.   Responding Sunday to a journalist s question about French President Emmanuel Macron s comments last month that he would not rule out sending European forces to Ukraine Putin said such a move would be one step from the third World War.

Dmitri LovetskyAP New avenues Putin s invasion has reshaped the world s postCold War geopolitical axes prompting the West to treat Russia as a pariah state after decades of more amicable relations. The war has also shrunk Putin s world after the International Criminal Court last year issued a warrant for his arrest for alleged war crimes committed in Ukraine obliging more than 100 countries to arrest the Russian leader if he sets foot on their soil.   But the war has also opened new avenues for Russia which has sought to forge new partnerships and strengthen existing ones. Russia s relations with China North Korea and Iran which have not condemned the invasion have deepened and Putin has attempted to court countries in the Global South as he pitches a vision of a world not led by the West.   Putin s critics accuse him of inventing foreign policy problems to distract from his government s inability to solve Russia s myriad domestic problems from low life expectancy to widespread poverty.

But the Levada Center a nongovernmental polling organization reports that nearly half of Russians strongly support the war in Ukraine and more than three quarters are somewhat supportive. Levada also reports Putin s approval rating at over 80 a figure virtually unknown among Western politicians and a substantial increase compared to the three years before the fullscale invasion of Ukraine.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_Russian_presidential_election, Vladimir PutinIndependent Vladimir PutinIndependent Presidential elections were held in Russia from 15 to 17 March 2024. 1 2 a It was the eighth presidential election in the country. The incumbent president Vladimir Putin won with 88 of the vote the highest percentage in a presidential election in postSoviet Russia 4 gaining a fifth term in what was widely viewed as a foregone conclusion. 5 6 He is scheduled to be inaugurated on 7 May 2024. 7 8  In November 2023 Boris Nadezhdin a former member of the State Duma became the first person backed by a registered political party to announce his candidacy running on an antiwar platform. 9 He was followed by incumbent and independent candidate Vladimir Putin in December 2023 who was eligible to seek reelection as a result of the 2020 constitutional amendments. 10 11 12 Later the same month Leonid Slutsky of the Liberal Democratic Party Nikolay Kharitonov of the Communist Party and Vladislav Davankov of New People announced their candidacies. Other candidates also declared their candidacy but were barred for various reasons by the Central Election Commission CEC. As was the case in the 2018 presidential election the most prominent opposition leader 13 14 Alexei Navalny was barred from running due to a prior criminal conviction seen as politically motivated. 15 16 17 Navalny died in prison in February 2024 weeks before the election under suspicious circumstances. 18 19 Nadezhdin despite passing the initial stages of the process on 8 February 2024 was also barred from running. The decision was announced at a special CEC session citing alleged irregularities in the signatures of voters supporting his candidacy. Nadezhdins status as the only explicitly antiwar candidate was widely regarded as the real reason for his disqualification although Davankov promised peace and negotiations on our own terms. 20 21 As a result Putin faced no credible opposition. 22 23 AntiPutin activists called on voters to spoil their ballot. The elections saw 1.4 million invalid or blank ballots cast around 1.6 of all votes cast a 45 percent increase compared to the 2018 elections. Most international observers did not expect the election to be either free or fair 24 with Putin having increased political repressions after launching his fullscale war with Ukraine in 2022. 25 26 The elections were also held in the Russianoccupied territories of Ukraine. 26 22 27 There were reports of irregularities including ballot stuffing and coercion 28 29 with statistical analysis suggesting unprecedented levels of fraud in the 2024 elections. 30  According to clause 3 of article 81 of the Constitution of Russia prior to the 2020 constitutional revision the same person could not hold the position of President of the Russian Federation for more than two consecutive terms which allowed Vladimir Putin to become president in 2012 for a third term not consecutive with his prior terms. 31 The constitutional reform established a hard limit of two terms overall. However terms served before the constitutional revision do not count which gives Putin eligibility for two more presidential terms until 2036. 32  According to the new version of the Constitution presidential candidates must 33  The individuals below appeared on the ballot. 34  Putin submitted documents to participate in the election on 18 December 2023 which were registered on 20 December. 37 38 The CEC analyzed 60000 signatures out of the 315000 submitted by Putin and found that only 91 0.15 were invalid which is significantly below the 5 threshold. 39  Individuals in this section have had their document submissions accepted by the CEC to register their participation and later gathered the necessary signatures from voters. The deadline to submit documents was 27 December 2023 for independents and 1 January 2024 for partybased nominations with the commission already announcing the rejection of some candidates based on alleged issues with their paperwork. 40  Towards the deadline to submit documents the CEC stated that 33 potential candidates were intending to be registered as candidates 24 independents and 9 partybased nominations. The commission accepted the documents of 15 candidates. 42  The next step was to collect signatures by 31 January 2024. Independents had to gather 300000 signatures from the public in at least 40 of Russias federal subjects to support their participation and thereby be included on the ballot while potential candidates nominated by political parties that are not represented in the State Duma or in at least a third of the countrys regional parliaments had to gather 100000 signatures. 43  Vladimir Putin was the first to achieve this having gathered more than half a million signatures by 30 December by 17 January he had gathered 2.5 million signatures. 44 45 He was followed by Davankov Kharitonov Slutsky Nadezhdin and Malinkovich in no particular order. Others either failed to achieve this or withdrew from the process. citation needed  The CEC accepted the signatures of Putin while rejecting Nadezhdin and Malinkovich on the basis of what it described to be irregularities. Davankov Kharitonov and Slutsky were not required to collect signatures as they were nominated by political parties represented in the State Duma. This confimed the final number of candidates at four. citation needed   52  Case 1 c  Cases 2 3 d  Congresses of political parties are held after the official appointment of election. At the congress a party can either nominate its own candidate or support a candidate nominated by another party or an independent candidate. Twelve parties held party congresses in December 2023 at which candidates were either nominated or endorsed. At Yablokos congress which took place on 9 December 2023 somewhat unconventionally the party decided that Grigory Yavlinsky would run for president as its nominee if he obtains 10 million signatures from potential voters 66 which is higher than the total number of votes Yavlinsky obtained during his most successful run for president 5.55 million. 67 Yabloko later stated that it would not be nominating any candidate. 68 Furthermore Yavlinsky only managed to gather around a million signatures. 69  The Left Front stated that it would run a primary election between 22 candidates but later announced it would not be holding the primary due to threats received from the police. 70 Instead the party called on their comrades in the Communist Party to vote for one of the following to be nominated at the party congress Pavel Grudinin Nikolai Bondarenko Valentin Konovalov Andrey Klychkov Sergey Levchenko Nina Ostanina Igor Girkin. citation needed  In June 2023 a few posters advocating for Yevgeny Prigozhin leader of the Wagner Group private military company were noticed 71 in Krasnodar with a QR code to a website hinting at the 2024 election. 72 Prigozhin himself denied any relation to such posters and any political activity in the internet 72 but fuelled speculation that he was about to go into politics after holding press conferences across Russia 71 and leading the Wagner Group rebellion. He died in a plane crash later that year.  According to an investigation published in February 2024 by a coalition of journals including VSquare Delfi Expressen and Paper Trail Media Putin ordered Decree Number 2016 titled On deputy heads responsible for social and political work of federal government agencies on 17 February 2023. The decree stated its aim of coordination between the Ministry of Education and Science and other state agencies to increase the number of voters and the support of the main candidates in the 2024 presidential election and other elections. Documents from a governmental nonprofit organisation ANO Integration highlighted the emphasis on increasing the number of voters and the support of the main candidates with turnout being used to indicate the scale of support and opposition to Putin. 73 74  The ANO Integration documents presented a plan to create lists of all employees and sublists of opinion leaders in institutions within the ministrys responsibility and to monitor political attitudes and voting preferences and increase the employees level of sociopolitical literacy. The documents planned for the preparation of secret instructions for social events in which selected opinion leaders and experts would meet with students and teachers in preparation for the election. Martin Kragh sv of the Center for East European Studies in Stockholm described the documents by stating All these documents show how little the Kremlin believes that people might just spontaneously support the ruling party. Mark Galeotti a British historian lecturer and writer described the process as prerigging the election in order to minimise the amount of manipulation needed in the numbers of votes cast for Putin in the election. He stated The Kremlin cannot even trust what mayors and governors tell them about the political situation in their region. 73 75 76  When asked by a BBC journalist about his electoral campaign Nikolay Kharitonov refused to answer why he thought he would be a better candidate than Putin before proceeding to praise the latter for trying to solve a lot of the problems of the 1990s and consolidating the country for victory in all areas. 77 Shortly after filing his candidacy in December 2023 Leonid Slutsky said he did not dream of beating Putin and predicted that the latter would achieve a huge victory. 78 Vladislav Davankov said he would not criticize his political opponents. 79  Early voting opened on 26 February and lasted until 14 March to allow certain residents in remote areas in 37 federal subjects of Russia as well as in the regions of Ukraine that it annexed following its invasion in 2022 to vote. 80 81 In the latter areas a campaign called InformUIK was set up to encourage participation in the election with its representatives going doortodoor escorted by armed men to compile voter lists and collect ballots from residences. A resident of Kherson Oblast described the elections in his area as a comedy show noting that households were being visited by two locals one holding a list of voters and the other a ballot box and a military man with a machine gun. 82  Russian officials also used home visits by the mobile polling stations to monitor the population and find those participating in resistance activities or refusing to obtain Russian government documents. 83 Reports also emerged of Russianinstalled authorities coercing people to vote by withholding social benefits and healthcare treatment while human rights activists said at least 27 Ukrainians were arrested for refusing to vote in Kherson and Zaporizhzhia Oblasts. 29 Despite Russian electoral laws prohibiting those without Russian passports from voting voters in occupied Ukraine were allowed to present any valid identification documents including a Ukrainian passport or driving license. 84 In Melitopol Zaporizhzhia Oblast soldiers armed with machine guns sealed off apartments being visited by mobile polling teams. 85 In one instance a man who fled his village near Mariupol Donetsk Oblast to Ukrainiancontrolled territory following the Russian invasion alleged that his name appeared in Russianproduced voter lists and was listed as having voted for Putin by election officials. 86  On the eve of the first round of regular voting on 14 March Putin called on citizens to vote in order to show their unity behind his leadership saying in a video message that We have already shown that we can be together defending the freedom sovereignty and security of Russia and urged them not to stray from this path. 87  Latviabased Russian news outlet Meduza reported that Kremlin officials asked Russias regional governments to secure 70 voter turnout and more than 80 support for Putin. 74 88  Civil servants employees at staterun companies and students have been strictly ordered to vote. Videos calling on Russians to vote presented them with an image of what awaits the country if they do not participate. In methods that analysts warn will be used to inflate the voter turnout and facilitate tampering voters in 29 federal subjects are being urged to cast ballots electronically. In many regions the vote doubles as a lottery with prizes ranging from public transport credits and caf vouchers to smart speakers cars and even apartments. 89 In Omsk officials issued 50000 free tickets at polling stations to firsttime voters aged between 18 and 24 years of age for one Ferris wheel ride at an amusement park. In Altai Krai voters were to be given a chance to win sanctioned goods and appliances such as an iPhone in a raffle provided that they upload pictures on VKontakte showing them at polling stations. In Strezhevoy Tomsk Oblast the mayor promised free bread rolls and porridge to voters. In Sverdlovsk Oblast authorities set up an election day trivia quiz about the regions history with and offered 2000 smartphones 45 apartments 20 motorcycles and 100 Moskvich cars as prizes but said that correct answers would not guarantee a win. In Tatarstan officials set a music festival in Kazan on 17 March that would be open to visitors upon presentation of a bracelet obtained at polling stations that would also guarantee free and unlimited access to public transportation along with a chance to win in a raffle with three Lada Vesta cars at stake. 90  Reports also emerged of pressure being exerted by authorities on students and young people to vote. Students at a construction college in Perm Krai were ordered to vote inside the campus with the school administration pledging to monitor turnout using video surveillance cameras. At Tula State Pedagogical University students were required to submit a photo of their ballot to prove that they voted. Its rector had also publicly endorsed Putin. At Voronezh State Pedagogical University students said they were required to inform authorities about who they were voting for. 91  On the regular election days polls opened at 0800 local time in Kamchatka Krai on 15 March and are expected to close at 2000 local time in Kaliningrad Oblast on 17 March. 87 Independent watchdogs were prevented from observing the conduct of the election as only registered candidates and statebacked advisory bodies were allowed to send observers to polling stations. The independent election monitor Golos described the election as the most vapid since the 2000 election noting that campaigning was practically unnoticeable and that authorities were doing everything to prevent people noticing that an election was taking place while state media provided less airtime to the election compared to 2018. It also described Putins campaign as disguised by his activities as president while his registered opponents were demonstrably passive. 92  On 15 March the Kremlin published images of Putin casting his vote online using a computer in his office. 93 On the morning of the same day the online voting system went down temporarily with Golos and other independent electoral observers attributing the outage to the traffic generated by votes coming from workplaces. 94  According to a Novaya Gazeta investigation using a method proposed by mathematician Sergey Shpilkin ru around 22 million of the nononline polling booth votes for Putin were falsified out of 64.7 million nononline votes for Putin in total. Novaya Gazeta described the analysis showing record levels of fraud even for a Russian presidential election. 95 96  Meduza carried out statistical analyses on the official results released by the CEC. Based on scatter plots of the vote percentage for Putin compared to turnout a tail in which voter turnout visually correlates to Putin support which appeared weakly in earlier Russian presidential elections was found by Meduza to completely dominate in 2024. Churovs saw a statistical effect interpreted as fraudulent in which sharp peaks at round numbers appear in voter turnout and percentage votes for Putin was found by Meduza to have strengthened in the 2024 election with Meduza arguing that the number of polling stations with likely fraud became the majority in 2024 while earlier the fraction of fraudulent polling stations had been a minority. Overall Meduza stated that the 2024 presidential election was almost certainly the most fraudulent in modern Russian history and that the sheer magnitude of fraud eclipses that of 2018. 30  On 16 March Golos released a video on social media appearing to show staff at a polling station in Krasnodar doing ballot stuffing. 97 It also said that it had received reports of attempts to inspect filledout ballots before they were cast and one instance in which police demanded a ballot box be opened to remove a ballot. 98 Thermochromic ink that disappears when heated was also allegedly used in Kursk and RostovonDon on 15 March. 99 The usage of such ink was previously reported during the 2021 regional elections in Khimki. 100 Overall Golos described the 2024 election as an imitation adding that it had not previously observed a presidential campaign that fell so short of constitutional standards. 101  Attacks have been launched against Russian electoral institutions in occupied areas of Ukraine. On the first day of early voting on 27 February 2024 two bombs were detonated at the local offices of the United Russia party and near a polling station in Nova Kakhovka Kherson Oblast. 82 On 6 March a local official of the Russian Central Election Commission in Berdiansk Zaporizhzhia Oblast was killed by a car bomb according to Ukrainian officials. 102 When asked about the killing the Ukrainianappointed governor of the oblast Ivan Fedorov attributed the attack to our resistance adding that they were linked to Ukrainian secret services and that it is abnormal when our citizens collaborate with Russians. 82 On 15 March an improvised explosive device was detonated inside a trash can in front of a polling station in Skadovsk Kherson Oblast 103 injuring five Russian soldiers. 104 On 16 March the Russianinstalled governor of Kherson Oblast Volodymyr Saldo claimed that one person was killed and four others were injured in a Ukrainian drone strike in Kakhovka which he claimed was an attempt to disrupt voting while TASS reported that a Ukrainian drone struck a polling station in Zaporizhzhia Oblast. 28  During an incursion into Kursk and Belgorod Oblasts on 12 March the Sibir Battalion an armed Russian opposition group based in Ukraine published a video condemning the elections saying that Ballots and polling stations in this case are fiction. 105 A member of the Freedom of Russia Legion which also participated in the attacks acknowledged that they were timed with the socalled elections and referred to it as a voting method. 106 Putin also described the incursion as an attempt to disrupt the election and interfere with the normal process of expressing the will of citizens. 107 Throughout the election the border city of Belgorod was subjected to shelling and rocket attacks by Ukraine killing two people in what most analysts believed to be an attempt to disrupt the vote and incite discontent against Putin by convincing Russians of his responsibility in bringing the war on Ukraine to Russian soil by launching the invasion in the first place although the high turnout of 78 percent in Belgorod Oblast suggested that the strategy had led to increased support for Putin. 108  On 25 March the independent news outlet Mediazona reported that the Federal Security Service had arrested three people on suspicion of plotting an arson attack against a Putin campaign office in Barnaul Altai Krai prior to the election. One of the suspects was said to have been in contact with an unidentified terrorist organization. 109  During regular polling several electionrelated incidents were reported across the country resulting in at least 13 arrests seven of which were for pouring liquid substances on ballot boxes and four for committing acts of arson in polling stations 110 one of which involved a woman in Saint Petersburg who was arrested for throwing a molotov cocktail at a school hosting two polling stations after having allegedly been promised a financial incentive by a Ukrainian Telegram channel. 111 A voting booth was also set on fire in Moscow. 112 In Podolsk Moscow Oblast a voter was charged with discrediting the Russian army and fined 30000 rubles 342 after spoiling her ballot by writing an unspecified message. 97 A voter in Saint Petersburg was ordered arrested on similar charges after writing the words No to War on her ballot. 113 Some voters uploaded images of them spoiling their ballots by writing messages such as killer and thief and waiting for you in The Hague a reference to the arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court against Putin over war crimes in Ukraine. 114  On 17 March a Moldovan national was arrested after throwing two molotov cocktails at the grounds of the Russian embassy ro ru in Chi in u which was being used as a polling station for Russian nationals in Moldova. Moldovan police said that the man who also claimed to be carrying Russian citizenship justified his action by some dissatisfaction he has with the actions of the Russian authorities. 115  In response to the attacks on polling stations former president and deputy chair of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev called for charges of treason to be filed against those who vandalize polling stations for attempting to derail the vote amid the fighting in Ukraine. 114  On 16 March the United Russia party said its website was targeted by a cyberattack. 116  Exit polls on 17 March released by the Russian Public Opinion Research Center showed Vladimir Putin with 87 of the vote 10 more than in 2018 Nikolai Kharitonov with 4.6 Vladislav Davankov with 4.2 and Leonid Slutsky with 3. Invalid ballots accounted for 1.2 of votes cast. 118  The CEC said that 388791 Russians cast their ballots from abroad. 119  In contrast to the official exit polls and results of the election both inside and outside of Russia unofficial exit polls of the votes cast abroad showed a much poorer performance for Putin. According to the Vote Abroad project 120 Davankov won a plurality of the votes at most of the voting stations abroad earning his best result in Trabzon. However Putin secured pluralities in Genoa Rome Nicosia Chi in u Ankara Samarkand and Bonn. He also won 59 in Athens making it his best performance abroad. 121 Conversely he got his worst showing in The Hague with just 2 of the vote. 122 Putin won 3 in Poland Serbia and Montenegro and 8 in Almaty Kazakhstan. 123  According to the Vote Abroad project Putin was also voted for by 4 of Russians living in Lithuania and the Czech Republic 5 in Istanbul Turkey 6 in Argentina and the United Kingdom 7 in Austria Ireland and Slovakia 8 in Estonia Denmark and Yerevan Armenia 9 in Portugal 10 in Thailand Finland and Berlin Germany 11 in Madrid Spain and Paris France 13 in Norway 14 in Sweden and Hungary 15 in Vietnam and the United States 16 in Tel Aviv Israel and Bern Switzerland 17 in Japan 22 in Cyprus 23 in Milan Italy 31 in Dubai 35 in Chi in u Moldova and Uzbekistan 36 in Kyrgyzstan and 38 in Rome Italy. 120 In total exit polls organized by exiled Russian activists across 44 countries showed Davankov gaining more votes than Putin in all but five countries. 124  The election was also held in Moldovas Transnistria an internationally unrecognized state. 46179 people with Russian citizenship voted in the election the lowest turnout in a Russian presidential election in the last 18 years. 97 voted for Putin with the other three candidates not having even obtained 1000 votes combined. 125 According to TRT Russian the low turnout indicated changes in the political activity of Transnistrians with Russian citizenship with over 73000 having participated in the last election six years ago. Furthermore it stated Moldovan analysts believed the low turnout indicated a trend that Transnistria was moving away from Russia and that Moldovan President Maia Sandus proEuropean policy was influencing the region. 126  The domestic watchdog Golos was not allowed to send election observers having been previously labelled a foreign agent in 2013 after angering Russian authorities for documenting evidence of fraud in the 2011 parliamentary vote and the 2012 presidential election won by Putin. 127 128  On 29 January 2024 the OSCEs Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights ODIHR announced that the organisation would not participate in international monitoring of election citing the lack of an invitation from Russia. 129  On 14 March delegations from 36 countries arrived in Russia at the invitation of the Russian Federation Council as foreign observers of the election who in fact do not represent observer missions but a visitors programme. 130 131 On 17 March 2024 the Chair of the Central Election Commission of the Russian Federation CEC Ella Pamfilova announced that 1115 international observers and experts from 129 countries were monitoring the electoral process. 132  On 21 March the CEC officially announced that Vladimir Putin had won the election receiving 87.28 of all votes cast including invalid ballots followed by Nikolai Kharitonov with 4.31 of the vote Vladislav Davankov with 3.85 and Leonid Slutsky with 3.20. 119  On 6 August 2023 Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told The New York Times that our presidential election is not really democracy it is costly bureaucracy. Mr. Putin will be reelected next year with more than 90 percent of the vote. Later he clarified that this was his personal opinion. 134 In an interview with the RBK news agency Peskov said that Russia theoretically does not need to hold presidential elections because its obvious that Putin will be reelected. 135  On 6 November 2023 journalist Yekaterina Duntsova announced her intention to run for the presidency in the 2024 election she said she would run as an independent candidate on an antiwar platform. 136 The next month her nomination documents were rejected by the Central Election Commission. 137  In November 2023 nationalist exmilitia commander Igor Girkin announced his intention to run as a candidate in the 2024 elections describing elections in Russia as a sham in which the only winner referring to Putin is known in advance. 138  In January 2024 citing unidentified sources in the Kremlin the independent news outlet Vyorstka reported that the CEC at the behest of the Kremlin will likely reject Boris Nadezhdins registration due to his criticism of Putin and antiwar stances. 139 In late January 2024 a source in the Putin administration told the Latviabased news outlet Meduza Theres a portion of the electorate that wants the war to end. If Putins opponent in the elections decides to cater to this demand they may get a decent percentage. And the Putin administration doesnt need that. 140 Russian state media intensified a smear campaign against Nadezhdin in the weeks leading up to the election. On 30 January 2024 Kremlin propagandist and television presenter Vladimir Solovyov warned Nadezhdin I feel bad for Boris. The fool didnt realize that hes not being set up to run for president but for a criminal case on charges of betraying the Motherland. 140  Following the CECs decision to ban him from running Nadezhdin wrote in his Telegram channel I do not agree with the decision of the CEC... Participating in the presidential election in 2024 is the most important political decision in my life. I am not backing down from my intentions. 141  Prior to the release of official results former president and deputy head of the Security Council of Russia Dmitry Medvedev congratulated Putin on his splendid victory. 142 After his victory was confirmed Putin held a news conference on 18 March calling his win a vindication of his policy of defying the West and his decision to invade Ukraine. 4 He also described the result as an indication of trust and hope in him. 98 Exiled Russian dissident Leonid Volkov said that Putins percentage of victory had not the slightest relation to reality. 143  In an interview with TV3 on 4 March 2024 Latvian justice minister Inese L bi aEgnere implied that Russians in the country who would participate in the election to be held in the Russian embassy in Riga could face criminal liability for justifying the invasion of Ukraine under Latvian law. 144 On 14 March L bi aEgnere appeared to have reversed her stance stating that participation in the elections does not equate to supporting Putin and is not punishable in any way she added that Latvia does not want to provoke an international row and intends to act like a democratic state. 145 On 11 March Armands Ruks the head of the Latvian State Police announced that voters at the embassy would be subjected to police screenings before entering. 146  The Russian ambassador to Moldova Oleg Vasnetsov ru was summoned to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Moldova on 12 March following Russias decision to open six polling stations in Transnistria for the election which Moldovan foreign minister Mihai Pop oi described as unacceptable. The Moldovan government had previously agreed to open only one polling station in the Russian embassy in Chi in u as per international law as it claimed. 147 Russias opening of polling stations in Transnistria was also condemned by Romania the United States 148 and France. 149 On 19 March Pop oi announced the expulsion of a Russian diplomat in response to the holding of elections in Transnistria. 150  The Ukrainian foreign ministry called on international media and public figures to refrain from referring to this farce as elections in the language of democratic states. 151 The United States condemned voting in Russianoccupied areas of Ukraine with State Department Spokesperson Matthew Miller saying that the US would never recognize the legitimacy or outcome of these sham elections held in sovereign Ukraine. 151 On 15 March Ukraines ambassador to the United Nations Sergiy Kyslytsya released a joint statement on behalf of Ukraine the European Union and 56 other countries including the US condemning the holding of the elections in occupied parts of the country. 152 The Ukrainian government said it would not press charges against its residents of occupied areas who participate in the election saying that they were being forced to vote. 153 The UN Security Council condemned the holding of the elections in occupied territories of Ukraine with deputy secretarygeneral Rosemary DiCarlo saying that holding elections in another UN member states territory without its consent is in manifest disregard for the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity and were invalid under international law. 154  On the first day of regular voting on 15 March European Council president Charles Michel sarcastically congratulated Putin for winning a landslide victory in the elections starting that day adding that there was No opposition. No freedom. No choice. 112 On 18 March the European Union condemned the holding of elections in Russianoccupied territories of Ukraine and said it would never recognise them. The EUs foreign policy chief Josep Borrell added that the election was held in the context of a shrinking political space. 155  Following the release of the results Germany described the vote as a pseudoelection under an authoritarian ruler reliant on censorship repression and violence. 156 The UKs Foreign Secretary David Cameron condemned the illegal holding of elections on Ukrainian territory 156 adding that the vote was not what free and fair elections look like. A spokesperson for the United States National Security Council described the election as obviously not free nor fair given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from running against him 4 but said that the US would recognize Putin as president. 157 In his evening address on 17 March Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy described the election as an imitation with no legitimacy adding that Putin was addicted to power and does everything he can to rule forever and that There is no evil he will not commit to prolong his personal power. 158 Italian foreign minister Antonio Tajani described the election as neither free nor fair while Czech foreign minister Jan Lipavsk called the election a farce and parody. 159 Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis called the voting a procedure that is supposed to resemble elections adding that Some might call it reappointment lacking any legitimacy. 160 The French foreign ministry said the conditions for a free pluralist and democratic election were not met but praised the courage of the many Russian citizens who have peacefully demonstrated their opposition to this attack on their fundamental political rights. 161 South Korea refrained from commenting on the election and said that it would make considerations of appropriateness in regard to a possible congratulatory cable to Putin. 162  Leaders of countries with neutral or friendly relations with Russia sent congratulations to Putin on his victory f along with President of Republika Srpska Milorad Dodik members of the Moldovan opposition and Hamas political chairman Ismail Haniyeh. 197 198 Presidents Aslan Bzhania and Alan Gagloev of the proRussian breakaway states of Abkhazia and South Ossetia respectively also congratulated Putin. 199 200  On 1 February 2024 jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and his allies called on supporters to protest Putin and the invasion of Ukraine on the last day of the election on 17 March all going to vote against Putin at the same time. 201 Following Navalnys death on 16 February there were calls from Andrius Kubilius Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Navalnys widow Yulia Navalnaya for the EU to recognize the Russian elections as illegitimate. 202 203 204 Navalnaya called for Russians critical of Putin to join the Noon Against Putin initiative to form long queues at polling stations at noon on 17 March before proceeding to vote for anyone other than Putin spoil their ballots or cast Navalnys name. 205 On the day of the action Navalnaya joined queues outside the Russian embassy in Berlin 206 for about six hours before casting her vote for her husband and praising protesters for giving her hope that everything is not in vain. 156 In Russia queues formed at polling stations in Moscow and Saint Petersburg at noon. 207 Queues were also observed outside Russian diplomatic missions worldwide including in Belgrade London Podgorica Tallinn Paris and Milan. 114 156 208 209  In response to the protests authorities in Moscow threatened to prosecute participants under Article 141 of the Criminal Code of Russia which prescribes five years imprisonment for the obstruction of elections or citizens electoral rights. 210 On 17 March the Russian human rights group OVDInfo said that 80 people in 20 cities across Russia were arrested for electionrelated offences. 142 In response to the Noon Against Putin protests abroad foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova described the queues outside Russian embassies as evidence of support for the Kremlin. 211 ,
https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/17/putin-poised-to-win-russian-presidential-election-by-a-landslide, Russian President Vladimir Putin has cemented his grip on power in a landslide election victory that has been widely criticised as lacking democratic legitimacy. In a postelection news conference Putin cast the outcome as a vindication of his decision to defy the West and invade Ukraine.  No matter who or how much they want to intimidate us no matter who or how much they want to suppress us our will our consciousness no one has ever succeeded in anything like this in history Putin said in an address from his campaign headquarters early on Monday morning.  It has not worked now and will not work in the future. Never.  Shortly after the last polls closed on Sunday early returns pointed to the conclusion everyone expected that Putin would extend his nearly quartercentury rule for six more years. According to Russia s Central Election Commission he had some 87 percent of the vote with about 60 percent of precincts counted. The result means Putin 71 will overtake Joseph Stalin and become Russia s longestserving leader in more than 200 years. Communist candidate Nikolay Kharitonov came second with just under 4 percent newcomer Vladislav Davankov third and ultranationalist Leonid Slutsky fourth early results suggested. Nationwide turnout was 74.22 percent when polls closed election officials said surpassing 2018 levels of 67.5 percent. Putin s victory was never in doubt as his critics are mostly in jail in exile or dead while public criticism of his leadership has been stifled. The Russian leader s most prominent rival Alexey Navalny died in an Arctic prison last month. For Putin a former KGB lieutenant colonel who first rose to power in 1999 the result is intended to underscore to the West that its leaders will have to reckon with an emboldened Russia whether in war or in peace for many more years to come.  The elections are obviously not free nor fair given how Mr. Putin has imprisoned political opponents and prevented others from running against him said the White House s National Security Council spokesperson. United Kingdom Foreign Secretary David Cameron said in a post on X that the vote was not what free and fair elections look like . In Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said This election fraud has no legitimacy and cannot have any . The election came more than two years after Putin s February 2022 fullscale invasion of Ukraine Europe s deadliest conflict since World War II. On Sunday thousands of Putin s opponents staged a protest against him although there was no independent tally of how many of Russia s 114 million voters took part in the demonstrations. Supporters of Navalny had called on Russians to come out to a Noon against Putin protest. At his press conference Putin referred to Navalny by name for the first time since his death saying he had supported a proposal to release him in exchange for prisoners held in Western countries.  The person who was talking to me hadn t finished his sentence and I said I agree Putin said. Putin was first nominated as acting president when former Russian President Boris Yeltsin resigned. He then won his first presidential election in March 2000 and a second term in 2004. After two stints as president Putin switched back to being prime minister in 2008 to circumvent a constitutional ban on holding more than two consecutive terms as head of state. But he returned to the presidency in 2012 and won a fourth term in 2018.,
https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/18/putin-wins-russian-election-and-talks-about-navaln.html, Russian President Vladimir Putin was upbeat after winning a fifth term in power in Russia s presidential election over the weekend. He chose the moment to make his first public remarks on the death of his political nemesis Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny mentioning his name for the first time in years. Putin won Russia s presidential election with a landslide 87 of the votes exit polls suggested late Sunday with votes still being declared Monday morning both in Russia and from polls of Russians abroad. The head of Russia s electoral authorities stated Monday morning that voter turnout was a recordbreaking unprecedented 77 up from 67.7 in 2018. In the highly stagemanaged election each of Putin s three opponents on the ballot paper who belonged to Russia s systemic opposition garnered around 34 of the vote. Antiwar candidates were barred from the election and most Russian opposition figures are either in selfimposed exile have been imprisoned or killed in Russia such as Navalny who died in a Russian Arctic penal colony last month. Navalny s family and supporters accused Putin of ordering Navalny s death. The Kremlin denied it had any involvement in the 47yearold s death with Russian authorities saying it was due to natural causes.  Addressing his supporters and the press at his campaign headquarters last night Putin was relaxed and upbeat pledging to defend and strengthen Russia. He also used the moment to make his first public comments on Navalny s death and mentioning his most vocal critic s name for the first time in public in years. When asked by NBC s Keir Simmons about the death Putin responded by calling his death a sad event and claiming he had been prepared to involve Navalny in a prisoner swap with the West.  As for Mr. Navalny. He has perished this is always a sad event. Well we have had other instances when people died in prison. Has nothing like that ever happened in the U.S.? It has happened and not once Putin told the assembled press and supporters Sunday night in comments translated by NBC.  By the way this will be unexpected but several days before Mr Navalny perished I was told by some of my colleagues and the administration employees some people that there is an idea to exchange Mr Navalny for some people in prison in Western countries. Believe me or not the person talking to me hardly finished their sentence when I said I agree! he claimed. Putin said he had agreed to the proposal on the condition that Navalny should never return to Russia where he was the figurehead of Russia s opposition movement.  But unfortunately the thing that happened happened Putin said adding Such things happen you can t do anything about it. This is life  Navalny s supporters said last month that there had been latestage talks between Russian and Western officials about a possible prisoner exchange involving Navalny before his sudden death which was announced on Feb. 16. Last month Navalny s allies also said that talks with Russian and Western officials about a prisoner swap involving Navalny were underway. The politician s longtime associate Maria Pevchikh said the talks were in their final stages just days before the Kremlin critic s sudden and unexplained death. Putin was rumored to loathe Navalny famously refusing to even utter his biggest critic s name. Putin s comments on Sunday night are believed to be the first he has mentioned Navalny s actual name in years. The Moscow Times noted last month that since as far back as 2017 Putin has not referred directly to the Kremlin s biggest opponent instead alluding to Navalny as that character this gentleman a poor excuse for a politician and a certain political force.  The Russian media had followed Putin s cue airbrushing Navalny out of their media coverage. Last night when reporting Putin s comments they described the opposition leader as a blogger. The opposition leader s death was barely mentioned in the Russian press at all. During Putin s 24 years in power opposition figures have been harassed intimidated and imprisoned with a number dying in mysterious circumstances. The erasure of political opponents has made the reelection of Putin a foregone conclusion in recent elections and in 2024 the Kremlin was seen to be looking for a landslide victory to legitimize Putin s foreign policies particularly the war against Ukraine.  We have many tasks ahead. But when we are consolidated no matter who wants to intimidate us suppress us nobody has ever succeeded in history they have not succeeded now and they will not succeed ever in the future he said as he addressed supporters and the media late Sunday night according to comments translated by Reuters. Russian proKremlin media hailed Putin s record win with news agency RIA Novosti describing it as a record in the history of modern Russia. By the end of Putin s next term in power in 2030 Putin will have overtaken Soviet dictator Josef Stalin as the longestserving leader in Russia s modern history. The U.S. U.K. and Ukraine were among the countries decrying the latest Russian ballot as neither free nor fair.  Thousands of Russians living abroad queued up at polling stations outside Russian embassies to vote with many participating in the noon against Putin protests following a call from Navalny s widow Yulia Navalnaya for voters to spoil their votes or to vote for any candidate apart from Putin.

https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2024/3/18/24104857/putins-russia-elections-2024-results-navalny, Putin has eliminated all of his most significant rivals cementing his grip on power. Voting started Friday and concluded Sunday. Putin won the contest with over 87 percent of the vote with a reported 77 percent turnout. The record postSoviet win was Putin s choreographed attempt to demonstrate his popularity and that of the war in Ukraine. But it is impossible to take much away given the level of repression in Russian society and Putin s ambition to make himself synonymous with the Russian state. The results come just a month after the death of Putin s most potent and vocal foe the anticorruption campaigner Alexei Navalny while he was serving a 19year sentence in an Arctic penal colony on multiple charges including extremism. It s also a little over two years after Russia s invasion of Ukraine which Russia refers to as a special military operation. Western countries have backed Ukraine during the grueling twoyear war and imposed heavy sanctions on Russia but those efforts have done little to loosen Putin s grip on power on the contrary Putin s government is at its most repressive since he first took power in 2000. Even before his fifth term starts Putin will already be the longestserving Russian leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. If he serves out the entirety of this sixyear term he will surpass Stalin and be in the running next with Catherine the Great and then perhaps eventually Peter the Great two rulers whose imperial power Putin has sought to mimic in his conquest of Ukraine and other former Soviet and imperial lands. With his reelection Putin will be in power till at least 2030 unless he dies or is somehow removed from power in the intervening six years. Putin s ruthless quest to build power not only his own but Russia s might come as a surprise to anyone who saw him when he first became president in 2000.  An unknown unmemorable bureaucrat from St. Petersburg who served in the Soviet spy agency in Dresden during the tail end of the Cold War Putin hardly seemed poised to gain the neartotal power he now has in Russia. But through a combination of immense wealth cronyism fraud increasingly cruel repression and constant information warfare Putin has consolidated his power over the past 24 years even when his deputy Dmitry Medvedev was nominally in charge.  Putin came into incredible wealth following the collapse of the Soviet Union and was appointed acting president in 1999 after Boris Yeltsin resigned. He was officially elected in 2000 serving his constitutionally mandated two terms and even seemed more willing to cooperate with the West during that time. But he was also displaying imperial ambitions fighting wars in Chechnya and Georgia. After Medvedev pushed through a constitutional change allowing additional presidential terms Putin regained the presidency in 2012. Amid the most fervent protests against the autocratic and corrupt regime his government began instituting and escalating brutal crackdowns on minority groups like the LGBTQ population opposition members and civil society to entrench a narrative of Russian tradition.   In the 1990s 2000s Russia experienced a range of issues such as economic and demographic crises and the loss of its impactful role on the international stage causing the perceived emasculation of the population Radzhana Buyantueva a researcher studying LGBTQ communities in Russia and their intersection with the political sphere explained to Vox over email in December. The Kremlin has utilized these insecurities in its antigender queerphobic propaganda cracking down on LGBTQ groups and other perceived opponents while also militarizing society and culminating in the escalating military aggression toward neighboring states Georgia in 2008 and Ukraine since 2014.  Putin also systematically undermined or eliminated political opposition cementing his hold on power not just through a popular narrative about Russia s national identity but also with election fraud murder poisonings draconian jail sentences and other political repression.  Over the past year the Kremlin quashed multiple attempts to compete against him in this weekend s elections. Though three competitors did stand in this year s contest they were all statebacked and lacked any real popular support. There were multiple true opposition candidates with demonstrated popular support like Boris Nadezhdin an antiwar candidate who attempted to stand against Putin this year but were barred from doing so.  Now almost anyone who would vocally oppose or present an alternative to Russian propaganda has been silenced or has fled. Will you support Vox today?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Putin_2024_presidential_campaign, The 2024 presidential campaign of Vladimir Putin was announced on 8 December 2023 during the ceremony of awarding state awards to the Russian military. 1  This campaign was Vladimir Putins fifth presidential campaign. He previously successfully ran for president in 2000 2004 2012 and 2018. According to Putins press secretary Dmitry Peskov Putins campaign will not differ from his usual work. Putins work schedule is full of events so he does not have much time to hold election events. 2  Putin was initially elected president of Russia in 2000 and reelected in 2004. In 2008 due to the twoterm limit provided for by the constitution Putin could no longer run for president and did not participate in the elections. President Dmitry Medvedev who was elected in the 2008 election appointed Vladimir Putin as his prime minister. In 2012 President Dmitry Medvedev refused to run for a second term and supported Vladimir Putin. Putin was elected president again in 2012 and reelected in 2018. Initially Putin could not run for president in 2024 due to the current term limit but constitutional reform took place in 2020. The constitutional reform established a hard limit of two terms overall. However terms served before the constitutional revision were not counted which gives Vladimir Putin eligibility for two more presidential terms. 3  In the second half of 2023 there were rumors about the date of Vladimir Putins announcement of his participation in the election. Initially it was assumed that Putin could announce his candidacy at the Russia international exhibition which opened on 4 November 2023 on National Unity Day. 4 However Putin did not announce his presidential candidacy during a visit to the exhibition. Vladimir Putin announced his intention to be reelected president on 8 December 2023 after the completion of the award ceremony for the Russian military on the occasion of Heroes of the Fatherland Day. Putin announced his candidacy not during a public speech but during a conversation with some guests. Putin announced his participation in the election in response to a question from the speaker of the Donetsk Peoples Republic parliament Artyom Zhoga. 1  On 9 December 2023 a meeting of the AllRussian Peoples Front was held on the issue of Vladimir Putins nomination as a presidential candidate. During the meeting an initiative group was formed to nominate Putin as a presidential candidate. On 16 December 2023 a meeting of the initiator group officially nominated Vladimir Putin as a presidential candidate took place in Zaryadye Park Moscow. 5 Since Putin is running as an independent candidate this means that in order to be included in the ballot Putin will need to collect at least 300000 signatures of Russian citizens in his support. 6  Despite Vladimir Putins participation in the elections as an independent candidate his nomination was supported by a number of political parties. In particular the United Russia and A Just Russia For Truth parties officially endorsed Putins candidacy at their congresses held on December 17 and 23 respectively. 7 8 In addition the leadership of a number of political parties also decided to approve Putins candidacy without holding congresses. In particular this decision was made by the Presidium of the Central Council of the Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice 9 and by the Federal Council of the Party of Business. 10  Since Vladimir Putin is running as an independent candidate in order to be included in the ballot he needs to collect 300000 signatures of Russian citizens in his support. On 23 December 2023 the collection of signatures in support of Putins presidential nomination started. 11  Signatures are collected by volunteers of the AllRussian Peoples Front at the headquarters of the movement. 12 In addition the United Russia and A Just Russia For Truth parties that endorsed Putins candidacy are involved in collecting signatures. 13 14  On 30 December 2023 the press service of the headquarters announced that more than 500000 signatures had been collected across the country in support of Vladimir Putin. Thus Putin managed to collect the necessary number of signatures for inclusion in the ballot in one week. 15 At the same time despite reaching the required number the collection of signatures was not stopped. On 4 January 2024 United Russia Secretary General Andrey Turchak announced an increase in the number of signature collectors. According to him this decision is connected with a large number of Russian citizens who want to sign in support of Putin. 16  On 16 January 2024 the United Russia party held the socalled single day of collecting signatures in support of Vladimir Putin. 17 As part of a single day of collecting signatures the party organized the work of about 20 thousand volunteers at the headquarters of public support for Putin public reception rooms of the party chairman regional and local executive committees of the party at the headquarters of the Young Guard of United Russia. 18  On 17 January 2024 Putins headquarters announced that more than 2.5 million signatures had been collected. 19  On 22 January 2024 Putins headquarters submitted 315 thousand signatures of voters to the Central Election Commission. 20 Of the 315000 voter signatures submitted 91 were declared invalid which is 0.03 with a maximum allowable 5. On January 29 the CEC registered Putin as a presidential candidate. 21  Vladimir Putin has not officially announced plans to make campaign trips unlike other candidates. In January 2024 Putin began making trips to the regions which at the same time were of a presidential working nature and were not positioned as campaign. As part of his trips Putin held working meetings with regional governors. On January 10 Putin visited Anadyr Chukotka Autonomous Okrug in the Russian Far East. This trip was Putins first visit to Chukotka during his entire tenure. During the trip Putin met with local residents and visited a greenhouse complex. 22 The next day Putin visited another Far Eastern region the Khabarovsk Krai where he met with local entrepreneurs and discussed issues of the Russian economy. 23  Subsequently in January and February 2024 Putin made working trips to Kaliningrad Oblast St. Petersburg and Tula Oblast. 24 25 26  On 21 December 2023 Vladimir Putins federal election headquarter opened in the Moscow Gostiny Dvor. As during the 2018 presidential campaign Putins campaign headquarters is led by three cochairs namely actor Vladimir Mashkov speaker of the Parliament of the Donetsk Peoples Republic Artyom Zhoga and doctor Maryana Lysenko. 27  At the same time according to media reports published before Putins nomination the cochairs of the headquarters perform media functions. In fact the company is headed by the Head of the Internal Policy Department of the Presidential Administration Andrey Yarin who holds the position of chief of staff at the headquarters. 28 29  At the same time as the federal headquarters regional headquarters began to open throughout the country. Each regional headquarters is also headed by several cochairs. Public figures and activists have been appointed to the positions of cochairs in many regions. 30  A number of Russian officials at federal regional and local levels and other notable people have publicly endorsed Putins candidacy.,

In January 2024 Alexei Navalny called on Russians to take part in this event. 4 Navalnys last political statement was a call to support Noon against Putin. 2 In 14 January 2024 participants on the talk show What to do? on the independent Russian channel TV Rain proposed this unified strategy for the elections. 5 One participant economist Sergei Guriev noted that the election would feature no candidates who are better or worse than Putin but only one very bad candidate. 5 Maxim Katz added that for the first time in a long time the entire opposition had a common goal to campaign for a vote against Putin. 5 Ivan Zhdanov shared the same opinion noting on 8 February that Putin wants to divide people and this action aims to unite people against Putin. 6  Initially the AntiCorruption Foundation considered the idea to be weak but when they calculated and realized that with the number of 2058 polling stations in only one city Moscow if at least half a million people simultaneously come to the rally then this will be 250 likeminded people for each of the polling stations a lot of people at each site. 7 8  The action was also supported by Mikhail Khodorkovsky Dmitry Gudkov Yulia Galyamina Mikhail Lobanov Arseny Vesnin Sergey Guriev Anastasia Shevchenko Vladimir Milov Leonid Gozman Abbas Gallyamov Vladimir Pastukhov Stanislav Belkovsky Olga Romanova Alexander Morozov Alexey Venediktov Tikhon Dzyadko Ekaterina Kotrikadze Ilya Shablinsky Dmitry Oreshkin Ilya Shepelin Dmitry Kolezev Lyubov Sobol Ekaterina Shulman Ekaterina Duntsova Marat Gelman Mitya Aleshkovsky Viktor Shenderovich Evgeny Kiselyov Vladimir KaraMurza Lev Ponomarev and other public figures. 1 9 10  This action is about the unity of the place and time of our protest against Putin. That is objective parameters on which there is no need to argue and which the authorities cannot change... This is not an election this is a special election operation. Why does Putin need it? To prove the unity of the Fuhrer and the nation there is Putin there is Russia. It is important for him to confirm once again this thesis which many already believe. Our task is to show that everything is exactly the opposite... Therefore it is important for us to show ourselves and the world that there are many of us. So this noon should be everywhere in Kaliningrad Vladivostok St. Petersburg in the Nile Valley and on the top of Everest. This will be a Russian afternoon where Russians must demonstrate their attitude towards Putin. And doing it on site is safe and legal. 1 11  Alexey Navalny described the action as a safe and legal way to express his protest. 9 12 Alexei Navalny also spoke about safety for those participating since at this time the turnout is already high and there are a lot of voters and it is simply impossible to single out those who vote against. 13  Political scientist Abbas Gallyamov on 1 February 2024 agreeing that this is a performance but in his opinion with a sufficient number of participants the Russian security forces and bureaucrats the West and Ukraine will see that Putin is not as legitimate as everyone thought. 7 A similar idea was expressed by Dmitry Kolezev. 14  According to a Radio Liberty study conducted on 5 February 2024 the initiative is actively discussed on social networks. 14 Leonid Volkov notes that it is especially important to support the initiative in large cities. 14 Sergei Boyko reminds that when collecting signatures the idea of showing the mass scale of the protest has already worked before. 14 Dmitry Gudkov believes that the 2024 elections should be treated as Putins special election operation and although Putin will get more than 80 support the opposition needs to jointly show the artificiality of Putin s result. 15  On 28 February the manifesto of the civil movement Peace. Progress. Human Rights was prepared by human rights activist Lev Ponomarev and his colleagues. Among other things the manifesto calls for making the Noon against Putin action truly massscale Only mass participation gives a chance to influence the situation. So lets ensure that the whole of Russia stands in line at the polling stations and the whole world sees it. The authors of the text called on the opposition to overcome differences and strengthen common action. The task of the opposition in these weeks is to be with the Russians to offer them relatively safe options for action to maximize their voice to agitate the doubters the manifesto says. 2  On 3 March Kirill Martynov in an interview with Idel.Realii a news outlet associated with Radio Liberty noted that he considered the action good and believed that it was necessary to participate in it. 16 He was echoed by the head of the Watch Evgeny Kochegin who believes that the main thing is to fulfill Navalnys last will. 17  On 2 February authorities threatened Yulia Galyamina with criminal charges for organizing the protest. 18  On 2 March 2024 Roskomnadzor blocked the campaigns website vpolden.org. As of writing within Russia it is only accessible through VPNs or anonymizers. 19  Former Legislative Assembly deputy Sergei Gulyaev shared information that Roskomnadzor sent a notice demanding that Gulyaevs video with a statement about the action be removed from the YouTube service. 20  On 3 March 2024 the authorities of several Russian cities decided to hold Maslenitsa festivities at the same time as the Noon against Putin protest. 21 This has drawn comparisons to the Shashlik Live music festival held amid the 2019 Moscow protests. 22  On 27 February 2024 Latvian Minister of Justice Inese L bi aEgnere expressed her opinion that Russians living in Latvia planning to attend the election essentially support Russias invasion of Ukraine. 23 On 11 March 2024 the Chief of the State police Armands Ruks warned that Russian citizens visiting the Russian embassy to vote during 15 17 March would undergo police screenings those found to be illegal immigrants might be deported. 24  On 14 March 2024 the Moscow Prosecutors Office released a press statement stating that it considered organizing andor participating in mass events involving simultaneous arrival at polling stations illegal in a veiled reference to the campaign. 25 ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Kharitonov_2024_presidential_campaign, The 2024 presidential campaign of Nikolay Kharitonov member of the State Duma was announced on 23 December 2023 during the Communist Partys congress. This was Nikolay Kharitonovs second presidential campaign. He had previously unsuccessfully run for President of Russia from the Communist Party in the 2004 election in which he took 2nd place receiving 13.8 of the vote. At the age of 75 Kharitonov became the oldest Russian presidential candidate in history breaking the record of 71yearold Vladimir Zhirinovsky in the 2018 election. Had he been elected Kharitonov would have become the oldest president of Russia in history and by the end of his presidential term in 2030 one of the oldest world leaders. 1  Kharitonov stated shortly after his nomination that during the election campaign he would not be criticising incumbent president Vladimir Putin who later entered and won the election. 2  Nikolay Kharitonovs candidacy for the presidential nomination from the Communist Party was proposed on 22 December 2023 during a meeting of the plenum of the Central Committee of the party. 3 Besides him the regional branches of the party also proposed the party leader Gennady Zyuganov Oryol Oblast Governor Andrey Klychkov and former Irkutsk Oblast Governor Sergey Levchenko. 4  At the Congress of the Communist Party held on 23 December 2023 Kharitonov was the only candidate for the presidential nomination. 175 out of 188 delegates of the congress voted for his nomination and 6 delegates voted against. 5  On 16 January 2024 Kharitonov arrived on a threeday visit to the Khabarovsk Krai. During the visit Kharitonov met with local residents university students and representatives of public organizations. 6  On 18 January 2024 the Communist Party held a press conference at which Kharitonovs election campaign was presented. 7 According to the presented program Kharitonov proposes a change in socioeconomic policy the development of industrial and agricultural sectors and new industrialization which requires the nationalization of the mineral resource base. Kharitonov also advocates the introduction of a progressive scale of taxation. 8  Kharitonovs team has launched a campaign website but as of 10 February 2024 it is still under construction. Kharitonov campaigned for the total abolition of capitalism within Russia stating that We ve played capitalism and that s enough! 9  After Kharitonovs nomination Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov announced that he would head his staff. According to Zyuganov he will manage the election campaign. 10  A number of Communist Party supporters criticized Kharitonovs nomination viewing him as a weak candidate. Thus the leader of the Movement for New Socialism Nikolay Platoshkin stated that Kharitonovs candidacy was put forward without coordination with the movement and therefore would not be supported by it. 11 The leader of the Left Front Sergei Udaltsov criticized Kharitonovs nomination calling such a decision weaker in terms of competitiveness. 12  A number of political scientists such as Konstantin Kalachev Ilya Grashchenkov and Alexander Rudakov expressed the opinion that Kharitonovs nomination could lead to the loss of a stable second place in the elections for the Communist party. 13 14 ,
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/russia-vladimir-putin-2024-election-results-today/,  Updated on March 18 2024 855 AM EDT CBSAP  As CBS News senior foreign correspondent Elizabeth Palmer reports the highlypredictable election results set Putin up to be the longest serving Russian leader in 200 years. But there were small acts of visible protest against the voting which was held just one month after Putins most potent critic opposition leader Alexey Navalny died in a remote prison in Russias far north. Russias Central Election Commission said Monday that with nearly 100 of all precincts counted Putin had won 87.29 of the vote. Commission chief Ella Pamfilova said nearly 76 million voters cast their ballots for Putin his highest vote tally ever.  Putin 71 hailed the overwhelming results as an indication of trust and hope in him. Critics saw his landslide win however as merely another reflection of the preordained nature of the election.  Of course we have lots of tasks ahead. But I want to make it clear for everyone When we were consolidated no one has ever managed to frighten us to suppress our will and our selfconscience. They failed in the past and they will fail in the future Putin said at a news conference at his campaign headquarters in Moscow early Monday hours after the polls closed. Putin referenced Navalny by name for the first time in public at the news conference declaring that he was ready to release him in a swap for unidentified inmates in Western custody just days before the opposition leaders death. As for Mr. Navalny. Yes he passed away. This is always a sad event AFP quotes him as saying adding that Putin remarked that a colleague had proposed several days before Navalny died that Navalny be exchanged for some people currently held in Western nations. The person who was talking to me hadnt finished his sentence and I said I agree AFP reports Putin said. Navalny supporters have alleged that Putin ordered his killing on the eve of the swap AFP notes.  If he finishes his upcoming term Putin will have been in power longer than any Russian leader since Catherine the Great in the 18th century the French news agency AFP pointed out. Public criticism of Putin and his war in Ukraine has been stifled in Russia. Independent media have been crippled. Former Putin ally Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane explosion in August 2023 two months after he led an armed rebellion against Moscows military leadership. Putins fiercest political foe Navalny died in prison last month and other major critics are either dead imprisoned or in exile. Beyond the fact that voters had virtually no choice independent monitoring of the election was extremely limited. Even with little margin for protest Russians crowded outside polling stations at noon on Sunday the last day of the election apparently heeding a call from Navalnys movement to express their displeasure with the president.  Lines outside a number of polling stations both inside Russia and at its embassies around the world appeared to swell at that time.  Among those heeding call was Yulia Navalnaya Navalnys widow who spent more than five hours in the line at the Russian Embassy in Berlin. She told reporters that she wrote her late husbands name on her ballot. Asked whether she had a message for Putin Navalnaya replied Please stop asking for messages from me or from somebody for Mr. Putin. There could be no negotiations and nothing with Mr. Putin because hes a killer hes a gangster.  But Putin brushed off the effectiveness of the apparent protest.  There were calls to come vote at noon. And this was supposed to be a manifestation of opposition. Well if there were calls to come vote then... I praise this he said at a news conference after polls closed. Some Russians waiting to vote in Moscow and St. Petersburg told The Associated Press they were taking part in the protest but it wasnt possible to confirm whether all of those in line were doing so. A voter in Moscow who identified himself only as Vadim said he hoped for change but added that unfortunately its unlikely. Like others he didnt give his full name because of security concerns.  Meanwhile supporters of Navalny streamed to his grave in Moscow some bringing ballots with his name written on them.  Meduza Russias biggest independent news outlet published photos of ballots it received from its readers with killer inscribed on one and The Hague awaits you on another. The latter refers to an arrest warrant for Putin on war crimes charges from the International Criminal Court.  Several people were arrested including in Moscow and St. Petersburg after they tried to start fires or set off explosives at polling stations while others were detained for throwing green antiseptic or ink into ballot boxes.  Stanislav Andreychuk cochair of the Golos independent election watchdog said Russians were searched when entering polling stations there were attempts to check filledout ballots before they were cast and one report said police demanded a ballot box be opened to remove a ballot. Some people told the AP they were happy to vote for Putin however unsurprising in a country where state TV airs a drumbeat of praise for the Russian leader and voicing any other opinion is risky. Dmitry Sergienko who cast his ballot in Moscow said I am happy with everything and want everything to continue as it is now. Chinese President Xi Jinping North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the presidents of Honduras Nicaragua and Venezuela quickly congratulated Putin on his victory as did the leaders of the exSoviet Central Asian nations of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan while the West dismissed the vote as a sham. British Foreign Secretary David Cameron wrote on X formerly known as Twitter This is not what free and fair elections look like. And Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy assailed Putin as a dictator who was drunk from power AFP reported adding that Zelenskyy said There is no evil he will not commit to prolong his personal power. Voting was held across Russia as well as in Russianoccupied portions of Ukraine a move that was condemned by more than 50 countries in a joint statement issued by the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller last week referred to voting in occupied Ukraine as sham elections. The United States does not and will never recognize the legitimacy or outcome of these sham elections held in sovereign Ukraine as part of Russias presidential elections Miller said.  When asked if the U.S. would recognize Putin as an elected president Miller said We will watch the election and Im sure well have plenty to say when it concludes.

AP PhotoAlexander Zemlianichenko President Vladimir Putin extended his reign over Russia in a landslide election whose outcome was never in doubt declaring his determination Monday to advance deeper into Ukraine and dangling new threats against the West. After the harshest crackdown on dissent since Soviet times it was clear from the earliest returns that Putin s nearly quartercentury rule would continue with a fifth term that grants him six more years. Still Russians heeded a call to protest Putin s repression and his war in Ukraine by showing up at polling stations at noon Sunday.  With all the precincts counted Monday election officials said Putin had secured a record number of votes underlining his total control over the political system. U.S. and other Western leaders denounced the election as a sham. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said there was nothing free or fair about the election but seemingly resisted calls from Russia s opposition to not recognize Putin as the winner.  AP AUDIO Putin extends rule in preordained Russian election after harshest crackdown since Soviet era. AP correspondent Charles de Ledesma reports. Ahead of the election Putin s greatest political foe Alexei Navalny died in an Arctic penal colony antiwar candidates were barred from the ballot and independent voices were silenced in a Kremlinbacked media blockade. No independent monitoring organizations were able to observe the election and analysts said online polling meant the vote was highly susceptible to manipulation. Any public criticism of Putin or his war in Ukraine has been stifled.   Russians vote in election dominated by Putin Putin basks in electoral victory that was never in doubt even as Russians quietly protest Russians cast ballots in an election preordained to extend President Vladimir Putin s rule  Putin appeared Monday evening on Red Square in the heart of Moscow at a concert to mark the tenth year since he annexed Crimea from Ukraine. Putin s three token challengers for the presidency appeared on stage beside him and publicly supported him after campaigns in which none of them criticized him. Putin has led Russia as president or prime minister since December 1999. At the end of his fifth term he would be the longestserving Russian leader since Catherine the Great who ruled during the 18th century. Emboldened by his sweeping victory Putin said he planned to carve out a buffer zone in Ukraine to protect Russia from crossborder shelling and attacks. Asked if an open clash could erupt between Russia and NATO Putin responded curtly by saying Everything is possible in today s world. He added It s clear to everyone that it will put us a step away from fullscale World War III.  Russian officials said they recruited over 500000 volunteers for the army last year but many expect Putin to mobilize more forces to attempt to push deeper into Ukraine. Analysts say that in the postelection period Russian authorities could also introduce unpopular measures such as raising taxes.  The Kremlin is now increasingly confident because it has learned just how passive the population is and how effective their own repression is said Nigel GouldDavies a senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Russia s Central Election Commission said Monday that with all the precincts counted Putin got 87 of the vote. Central Election Commission chief Ella Pamfilova said that nearly 76 million voters cast their ballots for Putin.

AP PhotoEbrahim Noroozi In illegally annexed regions of Ukraine at least 249 people were detained for refusing to take part in the vote and for criticizing Russian authorities according to the Ukrainian Eastern Human Rights Group.  Voting in the occupied territories took place literally at gunpoint when members of election commissions walked from door to door accompanied by military men with weapons said Pavlo Lysianskyi head of the group. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy slammed the election and voting in the illegally annexed regions saying everything Russia does on the occupied territory of Ukraine is a crime.  Germany also sharply criticized the vote. Russia as the chancellor has already said is now a dictatorship and is ruled by Vladimir Putin in an authoritarian manner said Chancellor Olaf Scholz s spokeswoman Christina Hoffmann.  Chinese President Xi Jinping Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan congratulated Putin as did North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the presidents of nations that have historic and current ties to Russia such as Azerbaijan and Belarus. Navalny s associates urged those unhappy with Putin or the war to go to the polls at noon Sunday and lines outside a number of polling stations both inside Russia and at its embassies around the world appeared to swell at that time. Navalny s widow Yulia Navalnaya who spent more than five hours in the line at the Russian Embassy in Berlin told reporters that she wrote her late husband s name on her ballot.  Asked whether she had a message for Putin Navalnaya replied Please stop asking for messages from me or from somebody for Mr. Putin. There could be no negotiations and nothing with Mr. Putin because he s a killer he s a gangster.  Putin referenced Navalny by name for the first time in years at the news conference declaring that he had been ready to release him in a swap for unidentified inmates in Western custody just days before the opposition leader s death. Sullivan the U.S. national security adviser disputed those claims. He told reporters during a White House briefing Monday that U.S. officials had spoken to Russia for months and years about releasing American detainees but have not heard a Russian official raise Navalny as part of a prisoner swap in any of these conversations.  Supporters of Navalny streamed to his grave in Moscow some bringing ballots with his name written on them. The Russian leader brushed off the effectiveness of the apparent protest and rejected Western criticism of the vote. Instead he tried to turn the tables on the West charging that the four criminal cases against former President Donald Trump were a use of the judiciary for political aims.  The whole world is laughing at it he said. Some people told the AP that they were happy to vote for Putin unsurprising in a country where state TV airs a drumbeat of praise for the Russian leader and voicing any other opinion is risky. Dmitry Sergienko who cast his ballot in Moscow said I am happy with everything and want everything to continue as it is now.  Voting took place over three days at polling stations across the vast country in illegally annexed regions of Ukraine and online. Several people were arrested including in Moscow and St. Petersburg after they tried to start fires or set off explosives at polling stations while a few others were detained for throwing green antiseptic or ink into ballot boxes. Many more were rounded up by police for attempting to protest.  The OVDInfo group that monitors political arrests said that about 90 people were arrested in 22 cities across Russia on Sunday.

https://www.europarl.europa.eu/thinktank/en/document/EPRS_BRI(2024)760358, On 1517 March 2024 more than two years into the unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression on Ukraine and one month after the sudden death in custody of the opposition leader Alexei Navalny Russia will hold its presidential election. Over 110 million Russian citizens including more than 6 million living in Ukrainian territories temporarily occupied by Russia are invited to take part in what is largely seen as a carefully staged legitimisation ritual for Vladimir Putins reappointment to a fifth term in office until 2030. Putin has been in power as either president or prime minister since the last day of 1999 and Russia has been at war for 19 of his 24 years at the helm. The constitutional changes of 2020 allowed Putin to stand for a fifth term and possibly for a sixth term in 2030. He is running for re election without any meaningful opposition after barring the two antiwar candidates who stood for election despite the restrictions and against a backdrop of a virtually total closure of the civic space draconian repression of public dissent and suppressed freedom of expression. The reappointment of Vladimir Putin seems inexorable. The objective of the Kremlin however is not just victory but a landslide result both in turnout and percentage of votes. This would legitimise Putins legacy and his war of aggression relegating the remaining opposition to an even more marginalised role and allowing Putin to implement unchecked his vision for the next six years. Recent changes to Russias electoral laws make it virtually impossible to conduct any meaningful monitoring and have significantly restricted the role of the media. Observers from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will not be present as was previously the case with the September 2021 parliamentary elections. A number of civil society organisations and personalities have called on the international community not to recognise the results as legitimate this demand was also made by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe PACE in October 2023.,
https://carnegieendowment.org/politika/92026, Russia s presidential election this month officially broke all the records. President Vladimir Putin received an unprecedented 87.3 percent of the vote amid turnout of 77.4 percent. His sparring partners got a meager 3 4 percent of the vote two or three times less than the ratings of the parties that nominated them. Voting has conclusively transformed into an elaborate performance for a single spectator and previously concealed methods for correcting the results of voting such as mobilizing both public sector and corporate employees are now proudly on show and have de facto been legalized. The presidential administration s political bloc headed by Sergei Kiriyenko had been quite open about the fact that it was aiming to set a record having promised Putin more than 80 percent of the vote with a turnout of no less than 70 percent. Kiriyenko began heading the political bloc of the presidential administration back in 2016 and by the 2018 presidential election he was already using the system of key performance indicators commonly used by private businesses. These KPIs were regularly leaked into the public space. In 2018 the target was 70 percent of the vote for Putin with 70 percent turnout. KPIs were also set before the vote amending the constitution in 2020 to allow Putin to remain in power beyond 2024 before the State Duma elections in 2021 and before this year s presidential election which took place on March 15 17. The KPIs are usually surpassed and this time was no exception. In the 2018 election when the KPI for Putin s share of the vote was 70 percent the president s official result was 76.7 percent although turnout fell short of the target by 2.5 percent. Kiriyenko s tactic is clear he draws inspiration not only from corporate management practices but also from the legacy of the Soviet Union when if workers fulfilled the plan they were simply not punished. If they surpassed it however they were rewarded. Accordingly the political bloc always sets the KPI slightly below what it believes to be feasible and then outdoes itself. This time around the RBC news agency reported that the Kremlin s formula for creating the appearance of electoral legitimacy would be 75 percent of the vote for Putin amid a turnout of 70 percent. But those figures were presented to regional authorities with a slightly different wording 75 percent or more. This meant they were interpreted as stating that 80 percent was the bar they needed to reach in order to avoid punishment. This was a deliberate move by Kiriyenko and his team who were banking on the zeal of the regional authorities and were not mistaken the majority of Russia s regions returned figures showing support for Putin of about 85 percent or even more. Putin was clearly delighted by this show of massive support so the Kremlin is unlikely to give up on this tried and tested system of vaguely worded KPIs and record targets anytime soon.  It s not just the turnout and performance targets that have become public under Kiriyenko. Many of the state s techniques and methods have also been laid bare. In 2024 this transparency has reached new levels. One notable example is mobilizing public sector and state corporation employees to vote along with those employed by businesses loyal to the government. Previously this tactic was not exactly concealed but nor was it openly advertised. It was known about by people interested in politics but not necessarily by the average person. Most people were supposed to think that everyone follows their heart when voting and not their boss s orders. In this month s vote administrative and corporate mobilization was given pride of place. Workers in protective helmets and office staff with smartphones in hands came to polling stations in groups of their colleagues to perform their civic duty mostly on the first morning of the threeday vote. The political bloc did not consider it necessary to distribute turnout evenly across all three days. This focus on the first day of voting gave the Kremlin room to maneuver over the turnout during the next two days. For the same reason it s more convenient the political bloc decided to retain multiday voting which was only introduced in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Opening the polling stations for three days not only makes it easier to mobilize the masses but also provides plenty of nocturnal opportunities for the manipulation of ballots. The same can be said of electronic voting. If Kiriyenko s predecessors Vladislav Surkov and Vyacheslav Volodin still had to consider the image projected by any tactics those concerns are long gone. Today s coerced voters are a world away from the unfortunates who a decade ago were secretly driven to special polling stations as far as possible from the watchful eye of election observers. This time around they were part of the pageantry of the election. It was important for the leadership to see the kind of friendly support from work collectives familiar from Soviet times. Corporate and administrative mobilization has effectively been legalized by the Kremlin s political bloc and regional authorities. Indeed the outcome of the 2024 campaign was the creation of new standards and practices that have legalized all the electoral tricks the Russian authorities have up their sleeves to ensure the required results. This new set of standards and practices includes all forms of voter mobilization multiday voting and competition over figures relating to turnout and support for the government candidate. Should Kiriyenko move to another job now that the election is over his successor will easily be able to apply these new standards going forward. Of course these new standards do not represent any kind of guarantee against a crisis for the Kremlin. There have been multiple occasions in history when autocratic leaders have won supposedly record percentages in elections only to be toppled in a few short years. Kiriyenko likely knows this perfectly well but what s currently more important to him is bringing in impressive numbers for his boss and receiving personal bonuses and perks for his team for doing so. Right now his standards work just fine above all for the leadership of the administration s political bloc itself.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2018_Russian_presidential_election, Vladimir PutinUnited Russia Vladimir PutinIndependent Presidential elections were held in Russia on 18 March 2018. Incumbent president Vladimir Putin was eligible to run. He declared his intent to do so on 6 December 2017 and was expected to win. This came following several months of speculation throughout the second half of 2017 as Putin made evasive comments including that he had still not decided whether he would like to step down from the post of president that he would think about running and that he hadnt yet decided whether to run for another term. Different sources predicted that he would run as an independent to capitalize more support from the population and although he could also have been nominated by the United Russia party as in 2012 Putin chose to run as an independent. Among registered voters in Russia 67.5 voted in the election. There were allegations of widespread electoral fraud including ballot box stuffing forced voting and threats against election observers. A video widely shared online showed people stuffing papers into ballot boxes. In addition critics of Putin were barred from running. citation needed  Putin won reelection for his second consecutive fourth overall term in office with 77 of the vote. Vladimir Zhirinovsky from the Liberal Democratic Party was the perennial candidate having unsuccessfully run in five previous presidential elections. Other candidates included Pavel Grudinin Communist Party Sergey Baburin Russian AllPeoples Union Ksenia Sobchak Civic Initiative Maxim Suraykin Communists of Russia Boris Titov Party of Growth and Grigory Yavlinsky Yabloko. Anticorruption activist Alexei Navalny announced his intent to run in December 2016 but was barred from doing so due to a prior criminal conviction which was widely seen as politically motivated 1 2 3 for corruption. Consequently Navalny called for a boycott of the election. He had previously organized several public rallies against corruption among members of Putins government. The President of Russia is directly elected for a term of six years since being extended from four years in 2008 during Dmitry Medvedevs administration. 4 According to Article 81 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation a candidate for president must be at least 35 years old hold no dual nationality have permanently resided in Russia for the past 10 years and cannot serve more than two terms consecutively. 5 Parties with representation in the State Duma can nominate a candidate to run for office while candidates from officially registered parties that are not in parliament have to collect at least 100000 signatures. Independent candidates have to collect at least 300000 signatures with no more than 7500 from each federal subject of Russia citation needed and also from action groups made up of at least 500 people. 6 The nomination process took place during Russias winter holiday period and 31 January 2018 was the last day for submitting signatures in support of contested access candidates. On 3 March 2017 senators Andrey Klishas and Anatoly Shirokov submitted to the State Duma draft amendments to the electoral legislation. One of the amendments involves the transfer of elections from the second to the third Sunday in March i.e. from 11 to 18 March 2018. 7 According to article 5 paragraph 7 of Russian Federal law No. 19FZ If the Sunday on which presidential elections are to be held coincides with the day preceding a public holiday or this Sunday falls on the week including a public holiday or this Sunday is declared to be a working day elections are appointed on the following Sunday. The second week of March includes International Womens Day 8 March which is an official holiday in Russia. 8 The bill passed through the State Duma and Federation Council without delay in May 2017 and was signed into law by Vladimir Putin on 1 June 2017. 9 10 On 15 December the upper house of the Federal Assembly the Federation Council officially confirmed that 18 March 2018 will be the date of the election officially beginning the process of campaigning and registration for candidates. citation needed This date is significant in the country as it is the fourth anniversary of Russian annexation of Crimea. 11  A total of 97000 polling stations were open across the country from 0800 until 2000 local time. 12  Political parties represented in the State Duma or the legislative bodies of not less than onethird of the federal subjects could nominate a candidate without collecting signatures. The following parties could nominate candidates without collecting signatures Civic Platform the Communist Party of the Russian Federation the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia A Just Russia Rodina and United Russia. On 1 July 2017 Chairman of Rodina Aleksey Zhuravlyov announced that his party would only support incumbent president Vladimir Putin in the election. 13 On 11 December the leader of Civic Platform Rifat Shaykhutdinov also said that his party would support Putin. 14 On 24 December the leader of A Just Russia Sergey Mironov stated that his party would not put forward a candidate. Senior party member Mikhail Yemelyanov confirmed that A Just Russia would support Putins candidacy. 15  Individuals belonging to a party without any seats in the State Duma had to collect 105000 signatures to become candidates while those running as independents had to collect 315000 and also to form a group of activists made up of at least 500 people. 16 Multiple political commentators including former presidential hopeful Irina Khakamada talked about the difficulty of gathering signatures without the support of a political party a hurdle which cast doubt on many of the claims of the large number of people who said that they would run for president as independents. 17 However according to CEC Chairwoman Ella Pamfilova the conditions for contestedaccess candidates were easier than ever because such potential candidates no longer had to collect 1000000 signatures. Pamfilova incorrectly predicted that there could be even more candidates in this election than there were in 2000 when 11 candidates contested the presidency the largest number of candidates in the history of presidential elections in Russia. 18  In July 2017 the Party of Growth announced that it would hold primaries to nominate a presidential candidate. Four candidates participated in the primaries Oksana Dmitriyeva Dmitry Potapenko Dmitry Marinichev and Alexander Huruji. Voting was conducted via the Internet from August to November 2017. 19  On 10 August 2017 the partys press secretary told the media that the results of the primaries will be taken into account at the party congress which will be held to decide the candidate for Party of Growth. However the winner of the primaries would not guarantee themselves the right to run on behalf of the party. 20  On 26 November it was announced that the party would nominate Boris Titov who was not involved in the primaries. According to a person from the party leadership none of the proposed candidates could obtain sufficient support. 21  On 2 November 2017 the Left Front headed by Sergei Udaltsov started online primaries for the nomination of a single leftwing candidate. Primaries were held in two rounds the first round took place from 2 to 23 November and the second round from 24 to 30 November. The first round included 77 candidates among whom were representatives of various leftwing political parties and organizations including Pavel Grudinin Yury Boldyrev Gennady Zyuganov Sergey Mironov who later supported Vladimir Putin Sergey Glazyev Zakhar Prilepin Viktor Anpilov Valery Zorkin Zhores Alferov Sergey Baburin who later was nominated as a candidate from the party Russian AllPeoples Union Natalia Lisitsyna who was later nominated as a candidate from the Russian United Labour Front Maxim Suraykin who was nominated as a candidate from the Communists of Russia and others. 22  Boldyrev and Grudinin made it through to the second round which was won by Grudinin who garnered 4086 votes 58.4. 23  At the end of December 2017 Grudinin was officially nominated as the candidate from the Communist Party. The bloc Third Force held primaries among candidates from ten nonparliamentary parties to nominate presidential candidates. According to the organizers the primaries would determine four presidential candidates representing different views. 24 25  The official presentation of the candidates was held on 30 October 2017. The candidates included Andrei Bogdanov Andrey Getmanov Olga Onishchenko Stanislav Polishchuk Sirazhdin Ramazanov Ildar Rezyapov Vyacheslav Smirnov Irina Volynets and Alexey Zolotukhin. 26  However the block failed to identify a clear winner then all candidates except for Olga Onishchenko declared that they would participate in the elections. Later however all of the candidates refused to participate. 27 28 29  These candidates were officially registered by the CEC. Candidates are listed in the order they appear on the ballot paper alphabetical order in Russian. 30  Sergey Baburin was nominated at the party congress on 22 December 2017. 31 On 24 December Baburin filed registration documents with the CEC 32 but the documents were rejected 25 December because the CEC identified violations in the information provided regarding 18 of his partys 48 representatives. 33 On 29 December Baburin resubmitted the documents and they were approved by the CEC. 34  Russian AllPeoples Union started to collect signatures in support of Baburin on 9 January 2018. Signatures were collected in 56 federal subjects. 85 86 On 30 January 2018 Sergey Baburin handed over the signatures to the CEC. When testing revealed only 3.28 of invalid signatures Sergey Baburin was admitted to the election. 87 88  At the end of November 2017 Pavel Grudinin won the primaries of Left Front a coalition of leftwing parties with no representation in the State Duma. Some branch of the Communist Party voted to support the candidacy of Grudinin and did not deny his nomination from the Communist Party. 36 Despite the fact that in early November the First Secretary of the Communist party Gennady Zyuganov said that his nomination is supported by all leftwing organizations which the media felt was the official statement from Zyuganov to participate in the election Zyuganov later denied this saying that the official decision will be made at the party Congress in December. On 21 December it was reported that Zyuganov proposed to nominate Grudinin. 89  Initially the Communist Party and the National Patriotic Forces of Russia NPFR planned to nominate a single candidate Grudinin supported by the Communists or Yury Boldyrev supported by the NPFR. Boldyrev also participated in the primaries of the Left Front where he lost in the second round to Grudinin. 90 According to Deputy Alexander Yushchenko Gennady Zyuganov was still among the candidates for the nomination. He named the other candidates as Yury Afonin Sergey Levchenko and Leonid Kalashnikov. On 22 December Zyuganov Levchenko and Kalashnikov withdrew their bids and Zyuganov rejected the candidacies of Afonin and Boldyrev leaving Grudinin as the sole candidate. 39 Grudinin was officially selected as the presidential candidate from the Communist Party at its congress on 23 December. 91  Russian opposition figure and anticorruption blogger Alexei Navalny started his presidential campaign on 13 December 2016. 92 In early 2017 he traveled to different cities across Russia to open campaign offices and meet with his supporters despite his involvement in legal cases that might have barred him from running. As noted in an article by Newsweek and by the former Russian presidential administration adviser Gleb Pavlovsky 93 the Americanstyle campaign by Navalny was unprecedented in modern Russia as most candidates do not start campaigning until a few months before the election. The primary focus of Navalnys campaign was combating corruption within the current government under Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. 94 On 2 March Navalny published a documentary on YouTube titled He Is Not Dimon To You detailing the corrupt dealings of Prime Minister Medvedev. 95 96 He then called for mass rallies to be held on 26 March to bring attention to this after the government did not respond to the documentary which only about 150.000 people attended across Russia. 2017 2018 Russian protests 97 98 26 March rally was the largest protest held in Russia since the protests in 2011. 99 Navalny called for another protest to be held on Russia Day which is 12 June. 100  On his website Navalny listed the main principles of his presidential program combating government corruption improving infrastructure and living standards in Russia decentralizing power from Moscow developing the economy instead of remaining in isolation from the West and reforming the judicial system. 101 His more specific economic proposals included instituting a minimum wage 102 lowering prices of apartments and reducing bureaucracy of home construction making healthcare and education free lowering taxes for many citizens taxing the gains from privatization decentralization of financial management and increase in local governance increasing transparency in stateowned firms implementing work visas for Central Asian migrants coming into the country for work and increasing economic cooperation with western European states. 103  In April 2017 it was reported that Navalnys campaign staff had collected more than 300000 pledged signatures from people across 40 regions of Russia electronically. 104 More than 75000 people signed up to volunteer for his campaign and nearly 700000 has been donated. 105 However his eligibility was put into question by his fiveyear suspended sentence for embezzlement of timber from the company Kirovles when Navalny was working as an aide to Governor Nikita Belykh of the Kirov Oblast. The Russian Supreme Court overturned his sentence in November 2016 after the European Court of Human Rights ECHR determined that Navalnys rights were violated and sent the case back to a district court in the city of Kirov for review. 106 In February 2017 the district court upheld Navalnys suspended sentence. 107 The Constitution of Russia does not allow convicted criminals to run for office. Navalny promised to appeal the result to the ECHR and said he would continue campaigning 108 while in early May the deputy head of the Russian Central Election Commission CEC commented that he would not be allowed to run unless the sentence is overturned. 109 In August the head of the CEC Ella Pamfilova reinforced this sentiment saying that it would take a miracle for Navalny to be granted permission to run. 110 She cited two scenarios in which Navalny could run if his conviction was overturned or if the federal election law was rapidly changed to allow those with criminal convictions to run. Pamfilova added that the probability of either scenario was extremely low. Pamfilova later commented that Navalny could legally run for president by some time in 2028 i.e. ten years after his sentence expires. 111 The Memorial Human Rights Center recognized Navalny as a political prisoner. 112  Members of the Navalny campaign were harassed and detained by the police including his chief of staff Leonid Volkov who was sentenced to thirty days in jail in early December for organizing an unauthorized rally requests for rallies in city centers are often denied in Russia 113 in Nizhny Novgorod. 114 115  Navalny published his election manifesto on 13 December 2017 two days before the official start of campaigning. 116  He officially submitted his documents for registration as a candidate on 24 December 2017 and was rejected by the CEC the following day due to his conviction. Later that same day 25 December Navalny called on his supporters to boycott the election in response. Mass street protests were planned for 28 January 2018. 117  Vladimir Putin announced his run on 6 December 2017 during his speech at the GAZ automobile plant. 118 A Just Russia 119 Civic Platform 14 The Greens 120 Great Fatherland Party 121 Labor Party 122 Party of Pensioners 123 Patriots of Russia 124 Rodina 125 and United Russia 126 endorsed his presidential bid. Rumors about the nomination of Ksenia Sobchak in the 2018 election appeared a month before she officially announced that she would run for president. 127  Sobchak officially announced that she would run for president on 19 October 2017 in a YouTube video. In the video Sobchak said she is the candidate against all because since the 2004 election the against all option or none of the above as it is more commonly known in Englishspeaking countries has been excluded from the ballot and Sobchak wants to give people the opportunity to again vote against all. At the same time Sobchak said she will withdraw her candidacy if Alexey Navalny is registered as a candidate by the Central Election Commission. 128  Originally Sobchak put herself forward as an independent candidate. In this case she would have had to collect at least 300000 signatures to be admitted to the election. Soon after however Sobchaks campaign team said that would be nominated by a political party namely the Peoples Freedom Party or Civic Initiative. 129  On 15 November 2017 it was announced that Sobchak would be nominated by Civic Initiative at its congress in December. 130  On 23 December 2017 at the Civic Initiatives congress Sobchak was officially nominated for president. On the same day she joined the party. 131 Sobchaks team began gathering signatures in support of her candidacy on 27 December soon after her registration documents were approved by the CEC. 132  In December 2017 it became known that the party Communists of Russia nominated Maxim Suraykin as presidential candidate. 133  On 28 May 2017 the Plenum of the Central Committee of the Communists of Russia decided on the nomination of Maxim Suraykin as a presidential candidate. In November 2017 Maxim Suraykin was one of the candidates proposed by the Left Front as a single candidate from the left opposition. The results of the voting on the website of the Left Front Suraikin won 59 votes. 134  On 24 December Maxim Suraykin was officially nominated at the Communists Russia National Convention. On the same day he also submitted to the Central Election Commission. 135  Initially the Party of Growth conducted primaries which were attended by four candidates Oksana Dmitriyeva Dmitry Potapenko Dmitry Marinichev and Alexander Khurudzhi. 136 Boris Titov did not participate in the primaries. However at the meeting of the federal council of the party it was decided to nominate Titov. According to a person from the party leadership none of the proposed candidates could obtain sufficient support. 137  According to Titov the main task of participation in the election is to promote the partys Growth Strategy economic program which was prepared by the Stolypin Club and presented to President Vladimir Putin in May 2017. During the campaign Titov and his team intend to travel around the country to promote the program. 138  Titov was officially nominated by his party on 21 December. 75 He submitted to the CEC the documents required for registration the next day. 76 Titovs documents were approved by the CEC on 25 December which meant that he could begin collecting signatures. 139 A party spokesman commented that the collection signatures in support of Titov will begin in early January 2018. 140  Economist Grigory Yavlinsky announced his presidential bid in February 2016 as the candidate for the liberal party Yabloko though suggestions that he would run were first voiced in 2013 after he was barred from taking part in the 2012 election. 79 His policies mainly focus on improving the economic situation through governance reforms and stopping involvement in conflicts. 141 He was nominated by the party leader Emilia Slabunova who stressed the need to unite all democratic forces behind one candidate and noted his political experience and also received an endorsement from opposition politician Vladimir Ryzhkov. Yavlinsky had previously run in the 1996 and 2000 presidential elections getting 7.4 of the vote in the former. citation needed He spoke at a party forum announcing the start of the campaign in February 2017. One proposal he made was to give out several acres of free land to families so they could build home there and develop it which he said would house 15 million families 142 and to turn the Russian Armed Forces into a fully professional military by abolishing conscription. 143  In March 2017 Yavlinsky stated that he would be visiting several major cities in fifteen different regions across the country to raise support. He used Alexei Navalnys recent tour of different cities as an example refusing to use the traditional model of campaigning a few months before the election. Since he is unable to visit more locations Slabunova the leader of Yabloko and Nikolai Rybakov his chief of staff will go to other cities to campaign as well. 80  On 1 November 2017 Yabloko launched the official website of Yavlinskys campaign. 144  Vladimir Zhirinovsky announced his participation in the presidential elections on 28 October 2016 as the candidate for the Liberal Democratic Party. In the event of his election Zhirinovsky promised to amend the Constitution of Russia and to radically change the policies of the country. In particular Zhirinovsky promised to abolish the federal structure of Russia and to return to the Governorates rename the post of President of Russia to the Supreme Ruler of Russia and to restore Russias borders to the borders of the USSR as of 1985. 48  In March 2017 Zhirinovsky promised to declare a general amnesty if elected president. 145  On 14 February 2018 the CEC set the schedule for the distribution of airtime for presidential candidates. 146 Debates took place on five federal TV channels Russia 1 Russia 24 Channel One TV Center and PTR as well as on three radio stations Radio Rossii Radio Mayak and Vesti FM. As in previous election campaigns incumbent President Vladimir Putin refused to participate in the debates. 147 148 149 150  Debates occurred from 26 February to 15 March. 151 Vladimir Zhirinovsky was the only candidate to attend the first debate with the other three candidates sending representatives. 152 The second debate which didn not involve any candidatetocandidate discussion was attended by six candidates and Boris Titovs representative. 153  Opinion polls published in the months preceding the election consistently showed Putin with an overwhelming lead over his competitors.  The European Union had already announced in advance that it would not recognize the results of the Russian presidential election in the annexed Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea. EU foreign affairs chief Federica Mogherini said the EU would follow through with its nonrecognition policy and called on Russia to respect the rights of Ukrainian citizens. 156 President of Austria Alexander Van der Bellen also warned that Moscow could not hold a legal election on the Crimean peninsula because the annexation of Crimea was illegal. 157  The EU and the OSCE had made it clear that they would not send any election observers to Crimea as neither organizations see it as a legitimate part of Russia. Russian authorities then invited a number of friendly and sometimes marginalized foreign politicians to give the elections in Crimea the appearance of international acceptance. Leonid Slutsky chairman of the parliaments foreign affairs committee named Andreas Maurer 158 from the Left Hendrik Weber from an organization called Peoples Diplomacy Norway Pedro Agramunt and Thierry Mariani. Russia commissioned Slutskys own organization the Russian Peace Foundation and the Polish association European Council on Democracy and Human Rights which in the past had brought election observers from rightwing populist and rightwing extremist circles to Crimea to organize their trips. 159 160 161  The final results of the elections were approved by the CEC on 23 March 2018. 162  India was the first world power to react to the election results saying in a congratulatory message to Putin that it vowed to push ties with Russia to a higher level. 163 Other countries which sent their congratulations included Azerbaijan Armenia Belarus Bolivia Bulgaria Croatia 164 Cuba Czech Republic Egypt Guatemala 165 Hungary China 163 Iran Israel 166 Japan Kazakhstan Kyrgyzstan Malaysia 167 Moldova North Korea 168 Philippines 169 Saudi Arabia Serbia 170 Singapore 171 Sudan 172 Syria Tajikistan Turkey Turkmenistan United States 173 Uzbekistan and Venezuela. 174  Western reaction to the election result was predominantly muted as the election came at a time of heightened tensions between the West and Russia due to the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal the ongoing U.S. investigation of the alleged Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections and a series of other issues. 175 The European Union said that violations and shortcomings in the election flouted international standards while the White House deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley initially said that there was no congratulatory phone call scheduled between U.S. president Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin. 175 176 163 Donald Trump later congratulated Putin in a phone call while the president of the European Commission JeanClaude Juncker later congratulated Putin 177 178 their actions in turn drew criticism. 179 180 181 182 France and Germany acknowledged Putins victory but both countries avoided explicitly using the word congratulate instead wishing success to Putin for his new sixyear term in office. 179  Voting irregularities were reported by an independent election monitoring group Golos. Edward Snowden criticized what he claimed was ballot stuffing and Russian opposition entities Alexei Navalny and Open Russia criticized what they alleged to be voting fraud. 184 175 Ella Pamfilova the head of the Central Electoral Commission said that there were no serious violations and those involved in the violations would be caught she later said that Putins level of support showed that society had united in the face of pressure from abroad. 184 175 According to one monitor group who observed voters in several voting stations which showed suspicious results in previous elections the actual turnout at these stations was 2134 while official results from these stations showed 7686 in one station 8765 physical voters were counted official results showed 13235 votes. The group concluded that in these elections the government and local administration officers chose to simply falsify the voting protocols rather than use easytospot ballot stuffing or carousel voting. 185 Election statistician Sergey Shpilkin said that while this election was slightly cleaner than the preceding ones there were around 10 million votes added in favor of Putin illegally. 186  Prominent Russian dissident 187 Garry Kasparov said that the elections were a charade. 188  The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE said that the election took place in an overly controlled legal and political environment marked by continued pressure on critical voices while the Central Election Commission CEC administered the election efficiently and openly. 189  The head observer of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation described the election as transparent credible democratic while Maxim Grigoriev deputy head of the monitoring group of the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation called it unprecedentedly clean. 184 ,
