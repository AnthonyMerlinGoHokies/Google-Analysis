https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/24/columbia-pro-palestine-protesters-face-deadline-to-clear-out-whats-next,  We are making important progress with representatives of the student encampment on the West lawn Columbia said in a statement released just after 3am 0700 GMT on Wednesday. The university had earlier given students a midnight deadline to dismantle tents if negotiations failed to deliver an agreement. That was initially extended to 8am 1200 GMT on Wednesday. University President Nemat Minouche Shafik had said the university will have to consider alternative options for clearing the area if talks did not yield an end to the encampments. In its latest statement the university again extended the deadline this time by 48 hours into early on Friday and said student protesters had agreed to four of the university s top demands. But several hours after the statement key student bodies behind the proPalestinian protests had not commented on those demands. ProPalestine protests have roiled university campuses in the United States from coast to coast. But Columbia has been the heart of the solidarity movement as the Gaza death toll spirals to more than 34000 people mainly children and women killed since the conflict erupted on October 7. And nationwide those studentled protests show no sign of easing up despite arrests and suspensions. Columbia University said in its early morning statement that student protesters had agreed to After the deadline was initially extended to 8am students who had taken down tents put them back up and largely returned to the encampment Caroline Anne Bissonnette a journalism student who has been covering the protests since the first day told Al Jazeera. The protesters are demanding that the university divest from corporations that profit from Israel s war on Gaza which entered its 200th day on Tuesday. Additional demands include more financial transparency about Columbia s investments and the severing of academic ties and collaborations with Israeli universities and programmes. The demonstrators are additionally demanding a complete ceasefire in Gaza. About 135am 0535 GMT on Wednesday Columbia University s student radio station WKCR citing sources on and off campus reported that 50 police officers from the force s Strategic Response Group SRG were lined up outside campus at 116th Street in New York City. A student reporter told WKCR that the police response was more severe than we have seen before and the SRG officers were wearing face masks and helmets and had zip ties as they faced protesters on the pavement. The radio station clarified that there was no indication that police were mobilising inside the campus. Police had earlier warned the protesters off campus that if they used amplified sound they would be arrested WKCR reported adding that the protests continued with booming sounds including drums horns and chants. On Monday the university announced that classes would be held in hybrid mode until the end of the spring semester. Columbia is now facing an academic boycott after more than 1400 academics around the world signed a letter saying they will not participate in academic and cultural events at the university and its affiliate Barnard College until suspensions of student protesters in recent days are reversed police are removed from the campus and Shafik resigns. The movement is organised by the Columbia University Apartheid Divest CUAD coalition of student organisations Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. In a statement posted on X CUAD said on Wednesday that its team had left the negotiations with the university and would not engage further until there is a written commitment that the administration will not be unleashing the NYPD New York Police Department or the National Guard on its students . It reiterated that civilians including large numbers of women and children have been killed in Gaza and every university in the besieged enclave has been destroyed.  We refuse to concede to cowardly threats and blatant intimidation by university administration. We will continue to peacefully protest it said. PRESS RELEASE Columbia University Threatens Students with the National Guard After Refusing to Bargain in Good Faith.  We refuse to concede to cowardly threats and blatant intimidation by university administration. We will continue to peacefully protest. cu4palestine pic.twitter.comIqAlXwyeHN  Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine ColumbiaSJP April 24 2024  In an email to the student body Shafik wrote that if the negotiations between Columbia s administration and the student organisers did not end in dismantling the encampment dispersing and following university policies then the university would consider alternative options to clear the encampment.  I also want to be clear that we will not tolerate intimidating harassing or discriminatory behaviour she warned adding that the right to protest is essential and protected at Columbia but harassment and discrimination is antithetical to our values and an affront to our commitment to be a community of mutual respect and kindness.  CUAD said in a statement at 1230am 0430 GMT on Wednesday that the university had threatened negotiators to call in both the national guard and police if we do not acquiesce to their demands . On April 18 more than 100 proPalestinian protesters were arrested on campus on charges of trespassing. Several students were also suspended from Columbia and Barnard including Isra Hirsi the daughter of Ilhan Omar a Democrat in the US House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that he will visit Columbia on Wednesday to meet Jewish students. In a post on X he wrote that Jewish students do not feel safe on campus. Let s be clear these are not peaceful protests these are antisemitic mobs he wrote. Amid antiIsrael protests Jewish students at Columbia University don t feel safe. It s become so dangerous that students were forced out of the classroom.  Let s be clear these are not peaceful protests these are antisemitic mobs. pic.twitter.commHwOOireTJ  Speaker Mike Johnson SpeakerJohnson April 23 2024  Delegations of Republican and Democratic members of Congress also visited the university s lockeddown campus on Monday to express concern for the security of Jewish students.

The path to Palestinian statehood has been crushed beneath an avalanche of bombs bullets smoke and fire. After Hamas is destroyed Israel must retain security control over Gaza to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel a requirement that contradicts the demand for Palestinian sovereignty Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s office said in a prepared statement in January. What little hardearned trust there was between Israelis and Palestinians has been shattered both by the slaughter of civilians by Hamas in Operation AlAqsa Flood on Oct. 7 2023 the deadliest day for Jews since the Holocaust and the subsequent war between Hamas and Israel. More than 30000 Palestinians have now died the majority of whom were civilians. Violent resistance has failed Palestinians and empowered extremists in Israel. In the Israeli collective psyche Oct. 7 was a tremendous violation because of the sneak nature of the attack the dismembering and burning of corpses the use of systemic rape as a weapon of war and the targeting of civilians including children in kibbutzim and attendees at a music festival. There is little appetite for peace with the perpetuators. In Gaza meanwhile Israel is carrying out a brutal and unremitting war that has buried countless children under rubble and seen the destruction of more than half of all houses as well as libraries court houses hospitals and all of the territory s universities. Many Palestinians view the Israeli military offensive as an attempted genocide. The greater part of the Palestinian political spectrum including both Fatah and Hamas broadly support the South African case in the International Court of Justice. Yet there is little hope of real victory for either side. Even today parts of Gaza remain under Hamas control and the top figurehead commanders inside Gaza who oversaw the planning and execution of the AlAqsa Flood Yahya Sinwar and Mohammed Deif have not been captured or killed. The Hamas political leadership outside Palestine is for the most part also still at large top Hamas political bureau members Ismail Haniyeh Khaled Meshal and Mousa Abu Marzook are still alive while Saleh AlArouri was assassinated by Israel in Beirut on Jan. 2. Both sides have hardened against a twostate solution. In a Jan. 16 interview Meshal dismissed the possibility of a twostate solution and said the Oct. 7 assault on Israel proved that liberating Palestine from the river to the sea is a realistic idea. In November another Hamas political bureau member Ghazi Hammad pledged that Hamas would repeat October 7 again and again until they achieved their goals the total destruction of Israel and a Palestinian state throughout the entirety of the land. Strategically this makes no sense. While occupied people have a right to violently resist military occupation for relatively disempowered people trying to assert their cause through advocacy and negotiation is a much more fruitful domain than violence because it relies on force of argument rather than military might. The Palestinian case for selfdetermination like any stateless people is bulletproof even if Palestinians themselves are not. The principle of selfdetermination is enshrined in the U.N. Charter and the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights. Palestinians have an inalienable right to rule themselves in the land on which they live. The trouble is that Hamas demands go far beyond demanding selfgovernance. What they and Palestinian antiZionists demand is the right to extinguish their neighbor s selfgovernance and conquer their neighbor s territory. It s the same right that Israeli extremists claim as they prepare new settlements on the West Bank and even dream of seizing land in Gaza. This overarching narrative of Palestinian resistance against the existence of any kind of Israel or Zionism has been deeply embedded into the cause since the start of the conflict and has produced little but tragedy for Palestinians. Since before 1948 the use of force to resist Zionist presence in the land was normalized and glorified. Muslim leaders such as the Grand Mufti Haj Amin AlHusseini refused to permit the establishment of any kind of Jewish state at the heart of the Arab world on what they held to be Islamic land. This absolute rejectionism fueled the antiZionist pogroms of the 1920s and 1930s and spurred the Arab Palestinian factions to try to extinguish the newly created state of Israel in 1947 to 1948. It was only in the 1990s that the Palestine Liberation Organization PLO renounced the strategy of violence recognized Israel and switched toward a strategy of diplomacy and negotiation. But this did not last very long. After the failure to agree upon a negotiated twostate solution at Camp David Yasser Arafat gave his blessing to armed groups including Hamas to initiate a Second Intifada perhaps as an attempt to achieve greater negotiating leverage and further Israeli concessions. Hamas takeover of Gaza and their war against Israel is simply a continuation of this long history of antiZionism. Of course this approach has failed to achieve both Hamas objective of eradicating Israel and also failed to grant Palestinians any kind of state. So why is this? Reliance on violence fuels a cycle of violence. This cycle of violence has led to severe Israeli retaliation exacerbating the suffering of civilians and leading to deep humanitarian crises cruelly visible in Gaza today. The use of violence has sabotaged the Palestinian cause on the international stage. Violent tactics have frequently been used to justify the delegitimization of Palestinians and serve as an excuse to prolong the occupation of the Palestinian Territories by Israel. Horrific acts such as those of Oct. 7 alienate potential allies and supporters particularly in the Western world. This is not to mention the internal Palestinian political landscape. The split between Hamas and the PLO over tactics strategy and goals has fragmented Palestinians. This has made it more challenging if not nigh on impossible to present any kind of united front in negotiations with Israel and the international community. The Israeli right has used Palestinian fragmentation as a way to prevent the development of a twostate solution. According to the Jerusalem Post in 2019 Netanyahu admitted as much when he told a private meeting of his Likud party that bolstering Hamas was part of his strategy to help maintain a separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza and prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yet the use of peaceful protests and strategies has also faced significant challenges. Despite the moral and ethical superiority of nonviolent resistance its effectiveness in the Palestinian context has been limited due to several factors. Peaceful protests often receive less media attention compared to violent conflicts simply because they are of lower impact and lack the visceral shock of terrorism. This lack of visibility can limit the impact on the global stage making it harder to garner any kind of recognition or negotiation leverage. While violence might isolate Palestinians on the world stage the dramatic and attentiongrabbing nature of violent attacks helps to bolster Hamas standing on the Palestinian street where they are seen to be the ones doing something anything to fight for the Palestinian cause. Beyond this peaceful protests have often been met with heavyhanded responses from Israeli security forces such as with the Great March of Return in 2018. This suppression not only risks the lives and wellbeing of protestors and also discourages participation from the broader population. Violent elements including Hamas have also infiltrated these movements and turned efforts at peaceful protest into acts of aggression. The ongoing occupation the blockade of Gaza and settlement expansions in the West Bank underpin a sense of desperation and frustration among Palestinians. As Frantz Fanon suggested in his anticolonialist opus The Wretched of the Earth violence sometimes can be viewed as a cathartic force and as a response to the systemic violence inflicted upon an occupied people by a process of colonization or military occupation and thus as a means for an occupied or colonized people to reclaim their humanity and agency. Additionally Palestinian nonviolent campaigns have been blighted by the same tendency for maximalist demands as Hamas violent campaigns. The Boycotts Divestment and Sanctions BDS movement for example opposes Palestinians having dialogue with Israelis in what they call antinormalization and makes maximalist demands about the right of return for all Palestinian refugees to Israel. By making maximalist demands that are never going to be met in a negotiation nonviolent campaigns can doom themselves to failure through the perception that these demands are not serious or in good faith. After this war we must call for a new approach rooted in realism a renewed commitment to coexistence and the willingness for both sides to compromise. Both Israelis and Palestinians need to abandon maximalist demands and delegitimization to focus on pragmatic solutions accepting the fact that neither side is going to disappear or push one or the other into the sea. Israelis and Palestinians must both accept that maximalist positions whether it s the complete destruction of Israel as a state or the denial of Palestinian statehood are unattainable implausible and only perpetuate the cycle of violence hatred and trauma. Moving beyond this demands a culture of coexistence where both Israelis and Palestinians acknowledge each other s right to live in peace and security. Education and public discourse on both sides must emphasize mutual respect understanding and the historical and emotional ties that both groups have to the land. The focus must shift back to negotiating a pragmatic compromise that can satisfy the core needs of both sides. Palestinians and Israelis need to prepare to head back to the negotiating table and work out our differences. This involves working towards establishing a Palestinian state with agreed borders preventing the takeover of this state by terrorist groups like Hamas. We need to establish a consensus on Jerusalem s status refugee rights and an end to settlement expansion. On the Palestinian side trust was lost in previous peace efforts due to settlement expansion. On the Israeli side trust was lost due to continued violence leading to a lack of faith in Palestinian leadership s ability to control extremism and provide security. The international community including regional powers and global organizations must play a constructive role in mediating and supporting this process. This includes ensuring that any agreements reached are respected and providing economic and political support for peace initiatives. This pathway to peace is undoubtedly challenging and requires courage vision and perseverance. But it s the only way toward a future in which two peoples can live side by side in peace dignity and safety. John Aziz is a British Palestinian writer and musician.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/19/blatant-aggression-reactions-to-us-veto-of-palestines-un-membership-bid, The veto on Thursday by Israel s main political and military backer had been expected ahead of the vote. Twelve countries voted in favour of the resolution which was introduced by Algeria while the United Kingdom and Switzerland abstained. The office of Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas said the US veto was blatant aggression which pushes the region ever further to the edge of the abyss . In a statement the presidency called the US veto unfair unethical and unjustified .  The fact that this resolution did not pass will not break our will and it will not defeat our determination Palestinian ambassador to the UN Riyad Mansour said after the vote.  We will not stop in our effort. The state of Palestine is inevitable. It is real he said.  Please remember that once this session adjourns in Palestine there are innocents paying the price with their lives for the delay in justice freedom and peace he added. The Palestinian armed group accused the US of standing in the face of international will by exercising its veto power and denying Palestinians full membership in the world body. The group said in a statement that it condemned in the strongest terms the American position biased towards the occupation as it called on the international community to exert pressure to go beyond the American will and support the struggle of our Palestinian people and their legitimate right to selfdetermination .  We assure the world that our Palestinian people will continue their struggle and resistance until they defeat the occupation take away their rights and establish their independent fully sovereign Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital it added. Tehran has said that Washington s use of its veto to block full UN membership for Palestine was irresponsible given the lack of opposition from any other Security Council member.  Washington s action exposed the fraudulent nature of US foreign policy and its isolated position foreign ministry spokesman Nasser Kanani said. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed deep regret at the failure of the UNSC to adopt the resolution and said it considered it a sad day for justice and a setback for efforts to bring peace to the region. This reveals the council s inability to carry out its responsibilities and role within the framework of maintaining international peace and security especially in light of the brutal war on the Gaza Strip it said. Statement Qatar Expresses Deep Regret at Security Council s Failure to Adopt Draft Resolution Accepting Palestine s Full Membership to UNMOFAQatar pic.twitter.com0bD8UImawg  Ministry of Foreign Affairs Qatar MofaQatar_EN April 19 2024  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs expressed deep regret over the inability of the UNSC to pass the resolution and said approving Palestine s bid to become a full UN member was a vital step and an inherent right of the Palestinian people . It said preventing Palestine from gaining full UN membership is a move that is not consistent with the legal and historical responsibility of the international community which needs to aid all parties in reaching a final and just solution to the Palestinian issue . President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said While everyone is on the side of Palestine unfortunately America puts forward their stance again by standing by the side of Israel.   We didn t expect anything different anyway.  Israel s Foreign Minister Israel Katz commended the US for vetoing the resolution which he labelled a shameful proposal in a post on X.  It is outrageous that even half a year after the October 7 massacre the UN Security Council failed to condemn Hamas s horrific crimes he wrote referring to the Hamasled attacks on southern Israel that triggered the current conflict. At least 33970 people have been killed and 76770 wounded in Israeli attacks on Gaza since October 7. US deputy ambassador to the UN Robert Wood said his country has worked vigorously and with determination to support Palestinian statehood in the context of a comprehensive peace agreement that would permanently resolve the IsraeliPalestinian conflict .  Since the attacks of October 7 President Biden has been clear that sustainable peace in the region can only be achieved through a twostate solution with Israel s security guarantee he said after he raised his hand to vote against and veto the resolution.  There is no other path that guarantees Israel s security and future as a democratic Jewish state Wood continued. He said that there are unresolved questions as to whether the applicant meets the criteria to be considered a state .  We have long called on the Palestinian Authority to undertake necessary reforms to help establish the attributes of readiness for statehood and note that Hamas a terrorist organisation is currently exerting power and influence in Gaza an integral part of the state envisioned in this resolution he said. Russia s ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia said that by exercising its veto the US has demonstrated what they really think of the Palestinians . Washington thinks they do not deserve to have their own state and it only realises the interest of Israel he added. Nebenzia said the US is turning a blind eye to the crimes of Israel against civilians in Gaza as well as the continuation of the illegal settlement activity in the occupied West Bank.  The aim is to break the Palestinians s will to force them once and for all to submit to the occupying power to turn them into servants and secondclass persons and perhaps to once and for all force them out of their native territory he said. However he said that policy is only having an opposite impact . Saudi Arabia expressed regret over the failure of the UNSC to adopt the resolution it said in a statement. Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide expressed his country s regret that the UNSC did not agree on admitting Palestine as a full member of the UN . Norway regrets that the Security Council did not agree on admitting Palestine as a full member of the UN. Norway is a staunch supporter of Palestine s right to statehood. The TwoStateSolution is the only way to durable peace between .  Espen Barth Eide EspenBarthEide April 18 2024  Malaysia s Foreign Minister Datuk Seri Mohamad Hasan expressed disappointment over the UN vote on Palestine.  The exercise of a veto on this crucial matter has called into question the genuine desire on the part of the council members to realise the inalienable rights of the Palestinians including their right to selfdetermination from the decades of Israel s illegal and belligerent occupation of the Palestinian Territory of the West Bank Gaza and East Jerusalem since 1967 he said in a statement.  Malaysia remains committed to the Palestinian cause and will continue efforts towards the establishment of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine based on the pre1967 borders with East Jerusalem as its capital he added. In a statement Indonesia s foreign ministry said the country deeply regrets another failure by the UN Security Council to adopt a resolution on the full UN membership of the State of Palestine due to a veto cast by one of its permanent members.   This veto once again betrayed the shared aspiration to build lasting peace in the Middle East the ministry added and said that Indonesia would continue to support Palestine s full UN membership. Pakistan expressed its disappointment at the UN Security Council s inability to reach a consensus.  Pakistan is deeply disappointed by the result of last night s debate at UNSC and its inability to reach a consensus and recommend Palestine s membership to UNGA. We regret the US decision to veto the draft resolution granting full membership of the UN to Palestine Foreign Office spokesperson Mumtaz Zahra Baloch said at a press briefing.

LEDERER Updated hourminute AMPM timezone monthFull day year Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print UNITED NATIONS AP The United States vetoed a widely backed U.N. resolution Thursday that would have paved the way for full United Nations membership for Palestine a goal the Palestinians have long sought and Israel has worked to prevent. The vote in the 15member Security Council was 12 in favor the United States opposed and two abstentions from the United Kingdom and Switzerland. U.S. allies France Japan and South Korea supported the resolution. The strong support the Palestinians received reflects not only the growing number of countries recognizing their statehood but almost certainly the global support for Palestinians facing a humanitarian crisis caused by the war in Gaza now in its seventh month. The resolution would have recommended that the 193member U.N. General Assembly where there are no vetoes approve Palestine becoming the 194th member of the United Nations. Some 140 countries have already recognized Palestine so its admission would have been approved likely by a much higher number of countries. U.S. deputy ambassador Robert Wood told the Security Council that the veto does not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood but instead is an acknowledgment that it will only come from direct negotiations between the parties.   Israel orders eviction of Palestinian family from east Jerusalem property reigniting a legal battle A Palestinian is killed as Israeli settlers rampage in his village and troops fire on stonethrowers The Security Council revives the Palestinian Authority s UN hopes. The US says not yet The United States has been very clear consistently that premature actions in New York even with the best intentions will not achieve statehood for the Palestinian people deputy State Department spokesman Vedant Patel said. His voice breaking at times Palestinian U.N. Ambassador Riyad Mansour told the council after the vote The fact that this resolution did not pass will not break our will and it will not defeat our determination.   We will not stop in our effort he said. The state of Palestine is inevitable. It is real. Perhaps they see it as far away but we see it as near.  This is the second Palestinian attempt for full membership and comes as the war in Gaza has put the more than 75yearold IsraeliPalestinian conflict at center stage. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas first delivered the Palestinian Authority s application for U.N. membership in 2011. It failed because the Palestinians didn t get the required minimum support of nine of the Security Council s 15 members.  They went to the General Assembly and succeeded by more than a twothirds majority in having their status raised from a U.N. observer to a nonmember observer state in 2012. That opened the door for the Palestinian territories to join U.N. and other international organizations including the International Criminal Court. Algerian U.N. Ambassador Amar Bendjama the Arab representative on the council who introduced the resolution called Palestine s admission a critical step toward rectifying a longstanding injustice and said that peace will come from Palestine s inclusion not from its exclusion.  In explaining the U.S. veto Wood said there are unresolved questions on whether Palestine meets the criteria to be considered a state. He pointed to Hamas still exerting power and influence in the Gaza Strip which is a key part of the state envisioned by the Palestinians. Wood stressed that the U.S. commitment to a twostate solution where Israel and Palestine live sidebyside in peace is the only path for security for both sides and for Israel to establish relations with all its Arab neighbors including Saudi Arabia.  The United States is committed to intensifying its engagement with the Palestinians and the rest of the region not only to address the current crisis in Gaza but to advance a political settlement that will create a path to Palestinian statehood and membership in the United Nations he said. Mansour the Palestinian U.N. ambassador reiterated the commitment to a twostate solution but asserted that Israel believes Palestine is a permanent strategic threat.   Israel will do its best to block the sovereignty of a Palestinian state and to make sure that the Palestinian people are exiled away from their homeland or remain under its occupation forever he said. He demanded of the council and diplomats crowded in the chamber What will the international community do? What will you do?  IsraeliPalestinian negotiations have been stalled for years and Israel s rightwing government is dominated by hardliners who oppose Palestinian statehood. Israeli U.N. Ambassador Gilad Erdan called the resolution disconnected to the reality on the ground and warned that it will cause only destruction for years to come and harm any chance for future dialogue.  Six months after the Oct. 7 attack by the Hamas militant group which controlled Gaza and the killing of 1200 people in the most brutal massacre of Jews since the Holocaust he accused the Security Council of seeking to reward the perpetrators of these atrocities with statehood.  Israel s military offensive in response has killed over 32000 Palestinians according to Gaza s health ministry and destroyed much of the territory which speaker after speaker denounced Thursday. After the vote Erdan thanked the United States and particularly President Joe Biden for standing up for truth and morality in the face of hypocrisy and politics.  He called the Palestinian Authority which controls the West Bank and the U.S. wants to see take over Gaza where Hamas still has sway a terror supporting entity.  The Israeli U.N. ambassador referred to the requirements for U.N. membership accepting the obligations in the U.N. Charter and being a peaceloving state.  How can you say seriously that the Palestinians are peace loving? How? Erdan asked. The Palestinians are paying terrorists paying them to slaughter us. None of their leaders condemns terrorism nor the Oct. 7 massacre. They call Hamas their brothers.  Despite the Palestinian failure to meet the criteria for U.N. membership Erdan said most council members supported it.  It s very sad because your vote will only embolden Palestinian rejectionism every more and make peace almost impossible he said.

On October 7 Hamasled gunmen from the Gaza Strip launched an attack in southern Israel deliberately killing civilians firing into crowds gunning people down in their homes and taking hostages back to Gaza including older people and children acts that amount to war crimes. According to Israeli authorities more than 1200 people most of them civilians have been killed since October 7 and 133 remained held hostage as of December 15. Shortly thereafter Israeli authorities cut off essential services including water and electricity to Gaza s population and blocked the entry of all but a trickle of fuel and critical humanitarian aid acts of collective punishment that amount to war crimes and were ongoing at time of writing. Israeli air strikes incessantly pounded Gaza hitting schools and hospitals and reducing large parts of neighborhoods to rubble including in attacks that were apparently unlawful. Israeli forces also unlawfully used white phosphorous in densely populated areas. They ordered the evacuation of all people from northern Gaza and displaced an estimated 85 percent of Gaza s population 1.9 million people as of December 11. More than 18700 Palestinians most of them civilians including more than 7800 children were killed between October 7 and December 12 according to Gaza authorities. The blockade exacerbated the humanitarian situation stemming from Israel s 16yearlong sweeping restrictions on the movement of people and goods into and out of Gaza. The prolonged closure as well as Egyptian restrictions on its border with Gaza has deprived the 2.2 million Palestinians in Gaza with rare exceptions of their right to freedom of movement and opportunities to better their lives severely limited their access to electricity health care and water and devastated the economy.  In the West Bank between the start of 2023 and December 12 Israeli forces had killed 464 Palestinians including 109 children according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs OCHA more than twice as many as in any other year since 2005 when the UN began systematically recording fatalities. This included unlawful killings stemming from Israel s regular use of excessive lethal force and some cases of extrajudicial executions. Israeli authorities also held 2873 Palestinians in administrative detention without charge or trial based on secret information as of December 1 according to Israeli Prison Services figures. This figure marks a threedecade high according to the Israeli human rights group HaMoked. During the first half of 2023 the Israeli government approved building 12855 new housing units in settlements in the occupied West Bank. This is the highest number the Israeli group Peace Now which has systematically tracked plans since 2012 has ever recorded. The transfer of civilians into occupied territory is a war crime. During the first eight months of 2023 incidents of settler violence against Palestinians and their property reached their highest daily average since the UN started recording this data in 2006 an average of three incidents per day as compared to two per day in 2022 and one in 2021. This included rampages by mobs of settler in Huwara and Turmus Ayya. That rate increased to over five incidents per day after October 7. Prominent Palestinian civil society organizations remain outlawed as terrorist and illegal organizations. Israeli forces raided their offices in August 2022. Israeli authorities repression of Palestinians undertaken as part of a policy to maintain the domination of Jewish Israelis over Palestinians amount to the crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.  Amid Israeli intense military operations since October 7 more than 46000 housing units have been destroyed and 234000 others damaged accounting for 60 percent of the housing stock in Gaza as of November 24 according to aid organizations. At least 342 schools have been damaged according to OCHA and 187 attacks on health care were carried out damaging 24 hospitals according to the World Health Organization WHO. Israeli air strikes and the blockade caused the majority of hospitals to cease operating. The lack of electricity and fuel forced wastewater desalination facilities and bakeries to shut down and contributed to telecommunications blackouts. The lack of water created a public health crisis. While some aid trucks began entering Gaza on October 21 with even more entering during a multiday ceasefire that began on November 24 the aid fell short of meeting the needs of Gaza s population. Israel s order to evacuate northern Gaza did not take into the account the needs of older people people with disabilities and patients many of whom are unable to leave. The move risks forced displacement a war crime. A prior round of hostilities in May featuring Israeli strikes on Gaza and rocket attacks on Israel by Palestinian armed groups in Gaza left at least 33 Palestinians in Gaza including at least 12 civilians and 2 civilians in Israel dead according to OCHA. Since 2007 Israeli authorities have blocked most of Gaza s population from traveling through the Erez Crossing the only passenger crossing from Gaza into Israel through which Palestinians can travel to the West Bank and abroad. Israeli authorities often justify the closure which came after Hamas seized political control over Gaza from the Fatahled Palestinian Authority PA in June 2007 on security grounds. However the closure policy is not based on an individualized assessment of security risk a generalized travel ban applies to all except those whom Israeli authorities deem as presenting exceptional humanitarian circumstances mostly people needing vital medical treatment and their companions as well as prominent businesspeople. Even those seeking urgent medical care outside of Gaza at times face denials or delays in approvals. WHO reported that 839 Palestinians in Gaza died between 2008 and 2021 while waiting for a response to their permit requests. During the first eight months of 2023 an average of 1653 Palestinians in Gaza exited via Erez daily according to the Israeli rights group Gisha. This marked an increase over previous years largely driven by work permits but remains less than 7 percent of the daily average of more than 24000 before the beginning of the Second Intifada or Palestinian uprising in September 2000. Gaza s exports during the first eight months of 2023 mostly produce destined for the West Bank and Israel averaged 607 truckloads per month less than the monthly average of 1064 truckloads prior to the June 2007 tightening of the closure according to Gisha. Authorities severely restricted the entry of construction materials and other items they deemed dualuse materials that could also be used for military purposes. The list of such items also includes Xray and communications equipment spare parts and batteries for assistive devices for people with disabilities and other vital civilian items.  Since October 7 and until time of writing Israeli authorities sealed its crossings into Gaza blocking the entry of people and goods including residents in need of urgent medical care from leaving Gaza via Erez. Israeli authorities have regularly resorted to such measures which target civilians and amount to unlawful collective punishment. The closure limits access to basic services. Between January and September 2023 families in Gaza were without centrally provided electricity for an average of 13 hours per day according to OCHA. Chronic prolonged power outages encumber many aspects of everyday life including heating cooling sewage treatment health care and business. The outages imposed particular hardships on people with disabilities who rely on light to communicate using sign language or equipment powered by electricity to move such as elevators or electric wheelchairs. More than 96 percent of groundwater in Gaza its only remaining natural water source is unfit for human consumption according to the Palestinian Water Authority and OCHA. This leaves most Gaza residents reliant on desalination and water coming via Israel which have been disrupted amid the hostilities. Before October 7 about 80 percent of Gaza s residents relied on humanitarian aid according to the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNRWA. Egypt also restricts the movement of people and goods via its Rafah crossing with Gaza at times fully sealing the crossing. In the first eight months of 2023 an average of 27975 Palestinians crossed monthly in both directions less than the monthly average of over 40000 before the 2013 military coup in Egypt according to Gisha.  Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups on October 7 deliberately killed civilians and committed a range of other abuses including taking civilians hostage and launched thousands of indiscriminate rockets at Israeli communities all of which are war crimes. During the October 7 attacks Hamasled fighters attacked the Supernova Sukkot Gathering outdoor music festival killing at least 260 people according to the Israeli rescue service and invaded homes. Armed groups threatened to execute hostages. They released some of the hostages in late November in exchange for the release by Israel of Palestinian prisoners as part of a shortterm ceasefire agreement. Human Rights Watch investigated an October 17 explosion at the alAhli Hospital in Gaza City which caused scores of casualties and found that it resulted from an apparent rocketpropelled munition such as those commonly used by Palestinian armed groups. In June 2022 and January 2023 Hamas authorities published footage that appeared to show Avera Mangistu and Hisham alSayed Israeli civilians with psychosocial disabilities that they have apparently held for more than eight years after the two men entered Gaza. Their incommunicado detention is unlawful. Courts in Gaza had sentenced 203 people to death since June 2007 when Hamas authorities took control in Gaza including 14 people between January and September 2023 according to Gazabased organizations Palestinian Center for Human Rights PCHR and alMezan. Hamas authorities have carried out 33 executions since June 2007 for common criminal offenses and collaboration with Israel none occurred during the first nine months of 2023. Hamas authorities forcibly dispersed protesters during the summer We Want to Live demonstrations against difficult living conditions roughing up and detaining some demonstrators and journalists according to PCHR and alMezan. The Palestinian statutory watchdog the Independent Commission for Human Rights ICHR received 56 complaints of arbitrary arrests and 81 complaints of torture and illtreatment against Hamas authorities between January and August 2023. Hamas authorities have blocked some women from traveling pursuant to regulations issued in February 2021 that allow male guardians to apply to courts to block unmarried women from leaving Gaza when such travel will cause absolute harm a broad term that allows men to restrict women s travel at will. In January Hamas authorities tracked down and forcibly returned two women Wisam and Fatma alTawil to their father whom they had previously fled from after reporting severe domestic violence including death threats. Israel s repression of Palestinians in the West Bank intensified during 2023 especially after October 7. Israeli forces carried out several largescale raids in 2023 particularly targeting the city of Nablus and Jenin refugee camp. The latter on July 34 was the scene of the largest and deadliest operation in the West Bank since 2005 resulting in the killing of 12 Palestinians including 4 children the temporary displacement of 3500 people and damage to 460 housing units according to OCHA. The more than 460 killed in 2023 at least an 18yearhigh included Palestinians who attacked Israelis or threw Molotov cocktails or stones at Israeli forces bystanders those helping the wounded and others uninvolved in the fighting. OCHA reported that more than half the fatalities since October 7 took place during Israeli operations that did not involve armed clashes. Israeli settlers killed 15 Palestinians as of December 7 according to OCHA. Between October 7 and November 28 settlers attacked 93 Palestinian communities the Israeli human rights group Yesh Din found. Israeli authorities have rarely held accountable security forces who used excessive force or settlers who attacked Palestinians. Less than 1 percent of complaints of abuses by Israeli forces filed by Palestinians in the West Bank between 2017 and 2021 and 7 percent of complaints of settler violence between 2005 and 2022 led to indictments according to Yesh Din. Even in the settler rampage of Huwara Israeli authorities released most of the 17 men arrested on suspicion of involvement within days of their arrest. In July the Jerusalem District Court acquitted the officer who in Jerusalem in 2020 killed Eyad alHallaq a 32yearold unarmed Palestinian man with autism who had threatened no one. The court called the fatal shooting an honest mistake.  Unchecked settler violence and intimidation continues. According to OCHA 1105 Palestinians including 4 entire communities displaced since the beginning of 2022 cite settler violence and the prevention of access to grazing lands by settlers as the primary reason that they were forced to leave their homes. Between October 7 and December 13 1257 people have been displaced. As of November 30 Palestinians killed 24 Israeli civilians during fatal attacks in the West Bank a more than 15yearhigh according to OCHA. This included an incident in January in which a Palestinian killed seven civilians including a child in the Israeli settlement of Neve Yaakov in occupied East Jerusalem. Hamas praised many of the attacks. Israeli authorities apply Israeli civil law to settlers but govern West Bank Palestinians under harsh military law. In so doing they deny them basic due process and try them in military courts with a nearly 100 percent conviction rate against Palestinians. As of December 1 Israel held 7677 Palestinians in custody for security offenses according to Israeli Prison Services figures. This includes 200 Palestinian children as of November 6 according to the Palestinian prisoner rights group Addameer. Israel incarcerates many Palestinians from the Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT inside Israel complicating family visits and violating international humanitarian law s prohibition against their transfer outside occupied territory. In May Khader Adnan 45 died in his prison cell on the 86th day of his hunger strike against Israeli detention practices. Adnan spent about eight years detained much of it in administrative detention and launched previous monthslong hunger strikes to challenge Israeli repression. More than 1400 complaints of torture including painful shackling sleep deprivation and exposure to extreme temperatures committed by the Shabak the Israel Security Agency in Israel and the OPT have been filed with Israel s Justice Ministry since 2001 resulting in three criminal investigations and no indictments according to the Israeli rights group the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel. The group Military Court Watch reported that in 26 cases of detention of Palestinian children they documented in 2023 69 percent said they were physically abused in detention by Israeli forces and 73 percent were strip searched. Palestinian rights groups have also reported a deterioration in the conditions of Palestinian prisoners including violent raids retaliatory prison transfers and isolation of prisoners less access to running water and bread and fewer family visits. Conditions worsened after October 7. Israeli authorities provide security infrastructure and services to more than 710000 settlers in the West Bank including East Jerusalem. According to OCHA Israeli authorities demolished 1004 Palestinian homes and other structures in the West Bank including East Jerusalem in 2023 as of December 11 displacing 1870 people which surpasses 2022 figures. Most buildings were demolished for lacking building permits which authorities make nearly impossible for Palestinians to obtain in these areas. The difficulty in obtaining Israeli building permits in East Jerusalem and the 60 percent of the West Bank under Israel s exclusive control Area C has driven Palestinians to build structures that are at constant risk of demolition or confiscation for being unauthorized including dozens of schools. Entire Palestinian communities in areas like the South Hebron Hills find themselves at high risk of displacement. International law prohibits an occupying power from destroying property unless absolutely necessary for military operations.  Authorities also sealed the family homes of Palestinians suspected of attacking Israelis acts of unlawful collective punishment. In July Israeli police forcibly evicted two older Palestinians Nora Ghaith 68 and Mustafa SubLaban 72 from their longtime family home in the Old City of occupied East Jerusalem to make way for Israeli settlers after the Israeli Supreme Court in March denied their final appeal after a decadeslong legal battle. They did so under a discriminatory law that allows settler organizations to pursue claims for land they claim Jews owned in East Jerusalem before 1948 a strategy they have particularly used in Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan. Palestinians are meanwhile barred under Israeli law from reclaiming property they owned in what became Israel and from which they fled or were expelled in 1948. Israeli authorities continued to require Palestinian ID holders with rare exceptions to hold difficulttoobtain timelimited permits to enter Israel and large parts of the West Bank including East Jerusalem. B Tselem describes this as an arbitrary entirely nontransparent bureaucratic system where many applications are denied without explanation with no real avenue for appeal.  As of early this year Israeli authorities maintained 645 checkpoints and other permanent obstacles within the West Bank according to OCHA in addition to ad hoc flying checkpoints. Israeli forces routinely turn back or delay and humiliate Palestinians at checkpoints without explanation while permitting largely unfettered movement to Israeli settlers. Israel continued construction of the separation barrier. Authorities began building the barrier more than two decades ago ostensibly for security reasons but 85 percent of it according to OCHA falls within the West Bank rather than along the Green Line separating Israeli from Palestinian territory. The barrier cuts off thousands of Palestinians from their agricultural lands isolates 11000 Palestinians who live on the western side of the barrier but are not allowed to travel to Israel and whose ability to cross the barrier to access their property and basic services are highly restricted. When complete 9 percent of the West Bank will be isolated beyond the separation barrier. The State of Palestine published the Convention against Torture and its Optional Protocol in the Palestinian Official Gazette in September effectively making it Palestinian law. Also in September the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture visited places of detention in the West Bank. However the PA continued its systematic practice of arbitrarily detaining opponents and critics including students. Lawyers for Justice a group that represents Palestinians detained by the PA documented 726 Palestinians they determined were detained arbitrarily between January and August 17 generally for periods of days or a few weeks. Between January and August 2023 the Palestinian statutory watchdog ICHR received 162 complaints of arbitrary arrests 86 complaints of torture and illtreatment and 13 complaints of detention without trial or charge pursuant to orders from a regional governor against the PA. In August the PA registered Lawyers for Justice after blocking its registration for months. Personal status laws for both Muslims and Christians discriminate against women including in relation to marriage divorce custody of children and inheritance. Palestine has no comprehensive domestic violence law. The PA has long been considering a draft family protection law but women s rights groups have raised concerns that it does not go far enough to prevent abuse and protect survivors. For much of the year Israelis took to the streets in unprecedented weekly protests across the country to oppose the government s plan to weaken judicial independence. In July the government implemented part of its plan when the Knesset passed a law that bars the Supreme Court from assessing the reasonableness of government decisions. The Supreme Court is reviewing the law in response to petitions challenging it. The Knesset renewed in March a temporary order that bars with few exceptions the granting of longterm legal status inside Israel to Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza who marry Israeli citizens or residents. Such a restriction which has been in place since 2003 does not exist for individuals of virtually any other nationality who marry Israeli citizens or residents. In February the Knesset passed a law now in effect that authorizes the revocation of citizenship or permanent residency of Palestinians who commit a terrorist act and receive compensation from the PA for that act and their consequent deportation to the West Bank. In September Netanyahu called for deporting African asylum seekers involved in violent clashes in Tel Aviv. Israeli authorities continued to systematically deny the asylum claims of African largely Eritrean Ethiopian and Sudanese asylum seekers in the country estimated by the Hotline for Refugees and Migrants to number 34500 while allowing in tens of thousands of Ukrainian refugees. Over the years the government has imposed restrictions on African asylum seekers movement work permits and access to health care and to education to pressure asylum seekers to leave. Many states condemned the Hamasled October 7 attacks. Far fewer though condemned Israeli authorities grave abuses. The United States and other Western countries provided arms or military support to Israel while other countries have provided military aid to Palestinian armed groups which in the face of ongoing grave abuses risk making them complicit in war crimes. President Joe Biden and other US officials traveled to Israel several times to urge civilian protection and to lobby Israeli officials to allow aid into Gaza although at time of writing the United States had not conditioned its military support to Israel on abiding by those requests. After October 7 the Biden administration requested US14.3 billion for further arms to Israel in addition to the 3.8 billion in US military aid Israel receives annually. The US also either transferred or announced it is planning to transfer Small Diameter Bombs Joint Direct Attack Munition JDAM guidance kits 155mm artillery shells and 1 million rounds of ammunition among other weapons. However the US halted small arms shipments out of concern that they could be transferred to settlers. In September the US admitted Israel into its visawaiver program allowing Israeli citizens visafree entry despite Israel not fully eliminating discrimination against US nationals of Palestinian Arab or Muslim origin when they travel to Israel and the OPT. In December the US and the United Kingdom issued travel bans against violent settlers in the West Bank. In midOctober the US vetoed a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses in Gaza but it abstained on a similar resolution in November. Like the resolution the US vetoed the one the UN Security Council adopted called for Israel and Palestinian armed groups to protect civilians and respect international humanitarian law. It was the council s first adopted resolution on Israel and Palestine since 2016. But again in December the US vetoed a Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire between Israeli forces and Palestinian armed groups. The General Assembly passed two resolutions calling for a ceasefire one in October and the other in December. Divisions among European Union member states prevented the bloc from reaching the unanimity necessary to adopt strong positions and concrete measures in response to Israeli abuses. This was particularly visible after October 7 including through EU member states diverging votes at the UN. While condemning Hamas EU states could not unanimously agree on calling out Israel s war crimes. The EU high representative Josep Borrell proposed a package of targeted sanctions for settlers abuses in the West Bank but prospects for its adoption remained slim in light of the unanimity requirement. The UN high commissioner for human rights in June updated the database of businesses operating in settlements. In July the UN Human Rights Council passed a resolution to ensure funding for the continued updating of the database. The International Criminal Court ICC prosecutor s Palestine investigation remained ongoing. The prosecutor spoke from the Rafah Crossing and visited Israel and Palestine amid the hostilities. He signaled the ICC s ongoing mandate to the parties and made clear that any serious crimes committed in the current hostilities fall within the court s mandate. In July 54 states and 3 intergovernmental organizations made submissions to the International Court of Justice ICJ on the advisory opinion the UN General Assembly requested in December 2022 on the legal status of Israel s prolonged occupation and legal consequences of its abuses against Palestinians. Public hearings on the request for an advisory opinion are scheduled to open at the ICJ on February 19 2024. In December South Africa filed a case at the International Court of Justice arguing that Israel violated its obligations under the 1948 Genocide Convention in the context of its military operations in Gaza. It called on the World Court to urgently issue provisional measures to protect the Palestinian people and to ensure Israel s compliance with the Convention. Public hearings on the matter were scheduled for January 11 and 12 2024.

At a glanceAt a glanceMore than 33000 Palestinians killed1.7 million Palestinians nearly 75 of the population are internally displaced3.1 million people in need of humanitarian assistance across Gaza and the West BankMore than 200 humanitarian aid workers killedOver 60 of Gaza s housing is damaged or destroyed100 of Gazans are experiencing hungerSupport the IRC s responseThis year the occupied Palestinian territories rose to their highest ever position on the IRC s Emergency Watchlist as devastating violence is causing a humanitarian emergency that will persist long after the fighting eventually stops.  Gaza is now the deadliest place for civilians and aid workers in the world. Palestinians are enduring the brutal consequences of the latest round of hostilities between Israel and Hamas which is being fought without sufficient regard for the international laws and norms built to protect civilians even in the most dire circumstances. Israeli forces began airstrikes and ground operations after Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups launched a deadly attack on southern Israel on October 7 2023 killing 1200 people and taking over 200 hostages many of whom remain captive. Israeli military operations have since caused catastrophic destruction and widespread death and displacement throughout Gaza particularly in the north killing more than 33000 Palestinians and injuring more than 75000 others. Up to 70 of those killed are said to be women and children.  The only way for civilians to be protected and for humanitarian assistance to be provided at the necessary scale required is for the conflict to end says Bob Kitchen the IRC s vice president of emergencies. The need for a ceasefire becomes more urgent as each hour passes with more than two million Palestinians facing humanitarian catastrophe.  Israel s offensive has killed more than 33000 Palestinians. More than 13500 children are dead and tens of thousands are unaccompanied or separated from their families. More than 1000 Palestinian children in Gaza were killed in the first 100 days of conflict alone. Some 1.7 million Palestinians nearly 75 of the population are estimated to be internally displaced with many having been displaced multiple times. They are forced to shelter in schools hospitals and U.N. facilities without basic supplies or sanitation.  The civilian population in the Gaza Strip is being squeezed into smaller and smaller areas. Nearly 1.5 million people which is more than half of Gazas population including over 600000 children have sought shelter in Rafah governorate. Humanitarian and human rights organizations have repeatedly warned that the planned Israeli ground incursion into Rafah promises to decimate life and lifesaving assistance. If Rafah meets the same fate as Gaza City and Khan Younis all parts of Gaza will be destroyed alongside any lifeline of hope and survival for hundreds of thousands of Gazans. The 7day truce in late November contributed to temporary improvements in humanitarian access and civilian protection. However since then widespread bombardment has resumed in Gaza putting the lives of hundreds of thousands at risk. The number of Palestinians in need of assistance will continue to grow as violence continues. Only an end to the fighting will offer civilians safety. Even before October 7 almost 80 of Gaza s population relied on some type of humanitarian assistance. After the destruction of key infrastructure and mass displacement 3.1 million people across Gaza and the West Bank now require humanitarian assistance. Many will experience protracted displacement given that over 60 of Gaza s housing has reportedly been damaged or destroyed reinforcing the importance of the rights of Palestinians most of whom are already refugees to return to their homes.  Children will lose years of education. Gaza s 600000 schoolaged children have lost access to education with 92 of schools being used as shelters nearly 30 of schools damaged or destroyed and staff killed or displaced. A new acronym WCNSF wounded child no surviving family has been coined by responders and medical staff due to the number of children who have now lost their entire families. More than 1000 children have lost either one of both their legs according to UNICEF all of whom will now require lifelong support. The IRC is deeply concerned about the escalating mental health and psychological toll on civilians particularly children who are grappling with the devastating impacts of war. The IRC in partnership with Anera is actively working to provide essential mental health and psychosocial support to children affected by the crisis in schools being used as shelters in the Rafah Khan Younis and Deir Al Balah governorates in Gaza. Across Gaza hospitals and clinics have been damaged and destroyed. Insecurity Insight recorded more than 700 incidents of violence against or obstruction of access to health care in Gaza since the outbreak of violence in October. Only 12 of Gaza s 36 hospitals remain partially functional.  No hospitals in Gaza are fully functioning any longer says Dr. Seema Jilani senior health technical advisor for emergencies. IRC staff and partners in Gaza continue to witness devastation in the health facilities that are left. The health services that remain are completely overwhelmed and lack health care personnel which has impacted operations. Health care professionals are continuing to work with minimal rest and scarce resources. Meanwhile ongoing border closures prevent patients from traveling to Israel the West Bank or East Jerusalem for treatment. On top of this a lack of fuel for water desalination has left 95 of Gaza s population without access to safe water increasing the risk of diseases like cholera.  Projections suggest that the spread of cholera measles polio and meningococcal meningitis pose a mortal threat adds Dr. Jilani. There have been 8000 reported cases of Hepatitis A a vaccinepreventable and usually limited illness. However without timely health care it can result in liver failure complications and even death.  Without an immediate ceasefire nearly 12000 people could lose their lives in Gaza as a result of disease. Nearly 90000 could die of secondary health impacts alone should the conflict escalate further. Almost all of Gazas population has been without access to essential food clean water and healthcare for six months pushing the population to the brink of famine. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification IPC acute food insecurity analysis conducted in December 2023 warned of a risk that famine may occur by the end of May 2024 if an immediate cessation of hostilities and sustained access for the provision of essential supplies and services to the population did not take place. The entire population in the Gaza Strip is facing high levels of acute food insecurity classified in IPC Phases 3 4 or 5. This includes half of the population about 1.11 million experiencing catastrophic food insecurity IPC Phase 5 Catastrophe. At catastrophic levels households face an extreme lack of food and are unable to meet other basic needs even after full employment of coping strategies.   To date there have been 28 reported deaths of children along with a number of adult deaths due to starvation and dehydration in Gaza. International humanitarian law prohibits the starvation of civilians as a method of warfare while the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court provides that intentionally starving civilians by depriving them of objects indispensable to their survival including willfully impeding relief supplies is a war crime.   Seeing the numbers of people facing imminent famine in Gaza is shocking and unprecedented. Children are starving due to an entirely manmade and preventable crisis explains Sam Duerden IRC team lead for occupied Palestinian territory.  If escalation continues a report from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and the Johns Hopkins Center for Humanitarian Health projects that almost half of all children 46 in Gaza aged 6 months to 5 years approximately 140000 young children could suffer from acute malnutrition by August. This would be a 15fold increase from the prewar prevalence of acute malnutrition which stood at just 3 before October 7. If this projection becomes reality Gaza could have one of the highest rates of acute malnutrition in the world. Famine can be halted still. A ceasefire must be implemented immediately and Israel must end its arbitrary denial of food water fuel and essential medicines. All parties must allow and facilitate rapid and unimpeded passage of humanitarian relief from all possible land routes and entry points and within Gaza. All hostages must be released. Israel severely restricted the amount of aid entering Gaza after October 7. Before the war 500 truckloads of aid entered Gaza daily with needs increased a huge uplift in aid is required but far less is actually arriving. Within the first six weeks of 2024 the Israeli military denied access to more than 50 of aid missions planned for north of Wadi Gaza and 25 for areas south of Wadi Gaza. Almost 5000 humanitarian aid trucks entered Gaza in March about onethird of the rates of preconflict aid delivery. The delivery of assistance has also been constrained by the displacement and death of humanitarian aid workers. As of April 2024 more than 200 humanitarian aid workers including over 170 U.N. staff have been killed making Gaza the most dangerous place for aid workers in the world. As the humanitarian situation in Gaza continues to reach new lows daily world leaders including President Biden must use all available influence to push for an immediate and sustained ceasefire. Airdrops or a new port that could take weeks to construct are not a solution.  Gaza needs a ceasefire now. Gaza s recovery after the fighting ends will depend on whether and how intensely Israel maintains its policy of preventing basic goods and services from entering Gaza. Throughout 2023 tensions also rose in the West Bank and East Jerusalem. Since October 7 violence between security forces settlers and Palestinians has increased significantly. Some 418 Palestinians in the West Bank and East Jerusalem have been killed including 106 children and more than 5700 others have been arrested including more than 2000 who are being held without a charge or trial.  The ongoing conflict has also spurred a notable increase in displacements within the West Bank linked to settler violence and the destruction of homes during Israeli military operations. Movement restrictions due to newly created checkpoints and roadblocks have also limited the availability of essential goods and medicines as well as children s access to education. The IRC is closely monitoring and assessing the situation in the occupied Palestinian territory oPt. Local partners have been leading the response in Gaza and we are supporting their objectives through financial technical and operational support. Partnerled activities contribute to the IRCs emergency outcomes in health basic needs education and safety. The IRC and Medical Aid for Palestinians MAP have deployed five successive Emergency Medical Teams to provide emergency and lifesaving medical care including direct medical care at hospitals and the distribution of medical supplies and pharmaceuticals. The team composed of trauma doctors surgeons pediatricians and water and sanitation experts are offering surge and relief support to hospitals and providing lifesaving medical care to injured Palestinians. To date our EMTs have delivered at least 175 surgeries and 552 consultations including minor procedures and critical care. In partnership with Anera the IRC is working to provide essential mental health and psychosocial support to Palestinian children. We are utilizing a comprehensive approach that prioritizes the needs of children between the ages of 4 and 18 to implement therapeutic activities including play art therapy and life skills training. Our activities are designed to empower children to cope with their experiences express themselves creatively and develop essential life skills for the future thereby promoting healing resilience and emotional wellbeing. By fostering a safe and supportive environment we aim to mitigate the longterm impact of the crisis in Palestine and have started providing psychosocial support services for 9000 children between 4 and 11 years old and informal literacy and numeracy sessions for 1200 children targeting people sheltering in schools. The IRC has also partnered with Nafs to establish a Mobile Community Center MCC that will enhance the access of marginalized people mainly children to their residential areas and provide them with Mental Health and Psychosocial services in the West Bank and Gaza strip. Our partnership with Nafs is expected to reach 5000 children in the next few months. The IRC has also procured or released 49 metric tons of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies which the IRC and our partners are distributing to support health facilities across Gaza. These include pediatric and psychotropic medicines as well as trauma supplies and are based on needs identified and coordinated across health actors working in Gaza. We have also partnered with Palestinian NGO Juzoor for Health and Social Development to address the health and mental health needs of those displaced and to provide access to basic services for children and families. Together we are providing critical services including health services psychosocial support and cash assistance in more than 20 shelters throughout Gaza. We expect to reach more than 30000 Palestinians through our partnership with Juzoor in the coming months. The International Rescue Committee IRC and Welfare Association Taawon partnered to combat the severe hunger affecting displaced families in Rafah southern Gaza where over one million people have been displaced and have sought refuge in what is considered Gaza s last haven. Together we delivered fresh food parcels to approximately 3500 families between January and February 2024. The IRC s response in oPt draws on our global experience and expertise in emergency response as well as our longstanding presence in the region. In 2022 IRC teams across Syria Lebanon Jordan Iraq Yemen and Libya helped 6.3 million people. The IRC plans to scale its programming in Gaza as soon as a ceasefire is in place. The IRC will aim to work directly and through partners to provide nutrition water sanitation and hygiene healthcare and protection particularly focused on separated children. The IRC is working with partners to deliver critical emergency aid to families in Gaza and conflict zones around the world. Donate now to support our critical work. We are on the frontlines providing critical aid to crisisaffected people in more than 50 countries including places on the 2024 Emergency Watchlist. Urge Congress to call for a ceasefire.

https://www.ochaopt.org/content/flash-appeal-occupied-palestinian-territory-2024, This Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT Flash Appeal calls for US2.822 billion for UN Agencies INGO and NGO partners to address the most urgent needs of more than three million people in the Gaza Strip Gaza and the West Bank including East Jerusalem covering a 9month period from April through December 2024. This document is the successor to the Flash Appeal for the Occupied Palestinian Territory OPT originally published on 12 October 2023. The first revision was published in early November 2023 and extended through March 2024. The Flash Appeal outlines the estimated resource requirements to reduce human suffering and prevent further loss of life in Gaza and the West Bank based on the best available information at this time. The 2.822 billion requested represents only part of the 4.089 billion that the UN and partners estimates is required to meet the needs of the 3.3 million people in need. It reflects what the Humanitarian Country Team foresees as most likely to be implementable over the coming nine months assuming for the short term namely the next quarter many of the current security concerns and access limitations will continue. It also does not include the cost of fuel which is no longer being provided through external funding. We have also assumed that the efforts to implement Security Council Resolution 2720 2023 will bear fruit during 2024. UNRWA plays a unique role in OPT serving as a key service provider and the backbone of the humanitarian response in Gaza. Two thirds of the population of Gaza 1.6 million people are Palestine refugees registered with UNRWA in times of emergency the Agency s support is extended to the broader population. The Agency has more than 13000 staff in Gaza over 3500 of whom are engaged in the emergency response. In the West Bank UNRWA serves 1.1 million Palestine refugees and other registered persons of whom 890000 are refugees. UNRWA is part of the humanitarian architecture in OPT and fully integrated into the humanitarian cluster system. Their requirements are included in this appeal. The magnitude of this response and operational constraints are beyond what has been seen before in OPT and in other contexts. Long term planning is not feasible however shortterm operational plans have been developed for Gaza outlining different scenarios and will be developed for the West Bank. The overall vision laid out in this appeal requires critical changes in the operating environment notably regarding access by personnel and of goods and security and funding must be timely and flexible to allow humanitarian actors to adapt programming to a highly dynamic context.

https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/04/1148731,  UN PhotoManuel El as Ambassador Robert A. Wood of the United States votes against the draft resolution on Palestine in the Security Council. FacebookTwitterPrintEmail The Security Council rejected Palestine s request for UN membership on Thursday with the United States casting a veto. In a vote of 12 in favour to one against with two abstentions the Council did not adopt a draft resolution that would have recommended the General Assembly to hold a vote with the broader UN membership to allow Palestine to join as a full UN Member State. The draft resolution is among the shortest in the Council s history The Security Council having examined the application of the State of Palestine for admission to the United Nations S2011592 recommends to the General Assembly that the State of Palestine be admitted to membership in the United Nations.  For a draft resolution to pass the Council must have at least nine members in favour and none of its permanent members China France Russia United Kingdom United States using their veto power. Amid the ongoing war in Gaza Palestine had submitted a request to the SecretaryGeneral on 2 April asking that a 2011 request to become a UN Member State be reconsidered. In 2011 the Security Council considered the request but was not able to find unity in sending a recommendation to the General Assembly which according to the UN Charter must hold a vote involving its 193 Member States. Earlier this month the Security Council sent the latest request to its Committee on the Admission of Member States which met on 8 and 11 April to discuss the matter. Palestine has been a Permanent Observer at the UN since 2012 before which it was an observer in the UN General Assembly. Read our explainer to find out more about Palestine s status at the UN here. Russian Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said this marked the fifth time the United States has vetoed a Council resolution since the start of the current hostilities in Gaza. The US once again demonstrated what they really think of the Palestinians he said. For Washington they do not deserve to have their own State. They are only a barrier on the path towards realising the interests of Israel.  He said at present an absolute majority of the global community supports Palestine s application to become a full member of the UN.  Today s use of the veto by the US delegation is a hopeless attempt to stop the inevitable course of history. The results of the vote where Washington was practically in complete isolation speak for themselves he said. US Deputy Permanent Representative Robert Wood said Council members have a special responsibility to ensure that their actions further the cause of international peace and security and are consistent with the requirements of the UN Charter. He said the report of the Committee on the Admission of New Members reflected that there was not unanimity among members as to whether the applicant met the criteria for membership in line with Article IV of the UN Charter. For example there are unresolved questions as to whether the applicant meets the criteria to be considered a State he said.  We have long called on the Palestinian Authority to undertake necessary reforms to help establish the attributes of readiness for statehood and note that Hamas a terrorist organisation is currently exerting power and influence in Gaza an integral part of the State envisioned in this resolution he said. It is for these reasons that the US voted no he explained. Mr. Wood said the US continues to strongly support a twoState solution.  This vote does not reflect opposition to Palestinian statehood but instead is an acknowledgment that it will only come from direct negotiations between the parties he said. Chinese Ambassador Fu Cong said the decadeslong dream of the Palestinian people has been quashed at a time when the admission of Palestine as a full member of the UN is more urgent than ever before. Over the past 13 years the situation in Palestine has changed namely settlement expansion so questioning Palestine s ability to govern is not acceptable he said. The establishment of an independent State is an inalienable right that cannot be questioned he continued. The admission of Palestine as a full member at the UN would indeed help in negotiations with Israel on a twoState solution. The wheels of history are rolling forward and Palestine and Israel will one day live in peace side by side Mr. Fu said pledging China s support with a view to seeing that day happen. Riyad Mansour Permanent Observer of the State of Palestine said his people s right to selfdetermination has never once been subject to bargaining or negotiation. It is a natural historic and legal right to live in our homeland Palestine as an independent State that is free and that is sovereign he said.  We came to the Security Council today as an important historic moment regionally and internationally so that we could salvage what can be saved. We place you before a historic responsibility to establish the foundations of a just and comprehensive peace in our region.  Council members were given the opportunity to revive the hope that has been lost among our people and to translate their commitment towards a twoState solution into firm action that cannot be maneuvered or retracted and the majority of Council members have risen to the level of this historic moment and they have stood on the side of justice and freedom and hope in line with the ethical and humanitarian and legal principles that must govern our world and in line with simple logic.  Mr. Mansour expressed appreciation to the countries who supported Palestine s request for UN membership and to those who voted in favour of the draft resolution.  The fact that this resolution did not pass will not break our will and it will not defeat our determination he said.  We will not stop in our effort. The State of Palestine is inevitable. It is real. Perhaps they see it as far away but we see it as near and we are the faithful.  Israeli Ambassador Gilad Erdan said the Palestine Authority is a terrorsupporting entity paying terrorists to slaughter us and Palestinians do not even recognise Israel as a Jewish State. He said Hamas was not mentioned here today because the Palestinian representative here does not represent at least half the Palestinian population.  Regardless of the Palestinians failure to meet the necessary criteria for UN membership most of you sadly decided to reward Palestinian terror with a Palestinian State he said. It s very sad because your vote will only embolden Palestinian rejectionism even more and make peace almost impossible.

As the Security Council takes up the matter while the devastating war in Gaza enters its seventh month we looked at Palestine s current status and what it takes to become a UN Member State. Recent escalations in the Middle East make it even more important to support efforts towards lasting peace between Israel and a fully independent viable and sovereign Palestinian State UN SecretaryGeneral Ant nio Guterres told the Security Council on Thursday.
