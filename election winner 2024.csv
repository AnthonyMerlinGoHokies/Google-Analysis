https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_elections, The 2024 United States elections are scheduled to be held on Tuesday November 5 2024. During this presidential election year the president and vice president will be elected. In addition all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and 34 of the 100 seats in the United States Senate will be contested to determine the membership of the 119th United States Congress. Thirteen state and territorial governorships and numerous other state and local elections will also be contested. This will be the first presidential election held after the overturn of Roe v. Wade and the third overall election cycle after the 2022 midterm elections and the 2023 offyear elections. Republicancontrolled states predominately passed neartotal bans on abortion in the aftermath of the Supreme Courts June 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization decision. By April 2023 abortion was largely illegal throughout much of the United States. 1 According to the Kaiser Family Foundation there were 15 states that have de jure early stage bans on abortion explicitly without exceptions for rape or incest Alabama Arizona Arkansas Florida Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Ohio Oklahoma South Dakota Tennessee Texas West Virginia and Wisconsin. 1 In states with laws granting exceptions it was reported de facto that very few exceptions to these new abortion bans have been granted and that patients who had been raped or otherwise qualified for exceptions were being turned away citing ambiguous laws and the threat of criminal penalties make them unwilling to test the rules. 2  Democrats outperformed Bidens results in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in several 2022 House special elections with abortion cited as a major contributor to their victories. 3 Then during the 2023 elections both Democratic and Republican operatives attributed the Democrats overperformance streak to the growing bipartisan support of broad abortion rights in the wake of Dobbs decision. 4 5 Thus many conservative political analysts and commentators called a continued Republican alliance with the antiabortion movement untenable and an electoral disaster and urged the party to favor abortion rights. 6 Some issue polling has shown Donald Trump the likely Republican nominee outrunning his party and closing the gap with Democrats on the issue of abortion but no election data with Trump directly on the ballot has happened to verify these results. 7  Mark Robinson who once advocated for a complete abortion ban without exceptions underwent a rhetorical shift in his North Carolina gubernatorial campaign. In 2018 he had labeled abortion as murder and genocide but as the leading Republican candidate for governor of North Carolina in 2024 he avoided mentioning abortion on the campaign trail. However his stance softened following the Supreme Courts 2022 Dobbs decision and the passage of North Carolinas 12week abortion ban in May 2023. Robinson who had shifted to emphasizing the term life instead of abortion expressed support for heartbeat legislation with exceptions for rape incest and the mothers life. Despite his past harsh rhetoric Robinsons thencurrent position reflected a more nuanced approach to antiabortion legislation. 8  On November 18 2022 three days after former president and Republican candidate Donald Trump announced his 2024 reelection bid U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed Jack Smith as special counsel to investigate Trumps role in the January 6 U.S. Capitol attack and Trumps mishandling of government documents including classified documents. On March 30 2023 Trump was indicted by a grand jury in Manhattan for his alleged role in a scandal stemming from hush money payments made to Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election. 9  On May 10 2023 Republican New York Congressman George Santos was indicted on federal charges of fraud and money laundering. 10  On June 8 2023 Trump was indicted on 37 federal charges related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents by the office of the Smith special counsel investigation. 11  On August 1 2023 a Washington D.C. federal grand jury indicted Trump again on four felony counts of conspiracy and obstruction related to Trumps role in the January 6 attack and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. 12  On August 14 a Georgia grand jury indicted Trump on racketeering and other felonies committed in an effort to overturn the states 2020 election results and the Trump Raffensperger phone call. 13 14 As of September 15 2023 Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges. On August 11 four months after incumbent president and Democratic candidate Joe Biden announced his reelection bid Garland appointed David C. Weiss to serve as special counsel to investigate Bidens son Hunter Biden who was indicted on September 14 2023 on three federal firearmsrelated charges. 15 16  On September 22 2023 Democratic U.S. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey and his wife Nadine were both indicted on bribery charges. 17 18  On December 19 2023 the Colorado Supreme Court removed Trump from the states 2024 Republican primary citing the Fourteenth Amendments ban on candidates who engage in insurrections. 19 This decision was later overturned by the US Supreme Court on March 4 2024. 20  The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial U.S. presidential election. This will be the first presidential election under the electoral vote distribution determined by the 2020 census. Presidential electors who will elect the President and Vice President of the United States will be chosen a simple majority 270 of the 538 electoral votes are required to win the election. President Joe Biden is running for a second term with Vice President Kamala Harris once again serving as his running mate. 21 Other individuals have launched their candidacies in the 2024 Democratic Party presidential primaries though the last time a sitting president eligible for reelection did not win renomination from their respective party was in the 1968 presidential election. 22  In November 2022 former President Donald Trump announced his candidacy in the 2024 presidential election. 23 Other candidates who have entered the 2024 Republican Party presidential primaries include former South Carolina governor and former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley and current Florida governor Ron DeSantis who has since suspended his campaign. 24 The first Republican presidential debate was held on August 23 2023 and the first primary contest was the 2024 Iowa Republican presidential caucuses which was held on January 15 2024. 25  In October 2023 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his run as an independent presidential candidate. 26 By the next month Kennedys polling was at the highest levels for a candidate outside the two major parties since Ross Perot in 1992. 27 28  All 33 seats in Senate Class 1 and one seat in Senate Class 2 will be up for election at least one additional special election will take place to fill vacancies that arise during the 118th Congress. Democrats control the majority in the closelydivided Senate following the 2022 U.S. Senate elections but they will have to defend 23 seats in 2024. Three Democraticheld seats up for election are in the heavily Republicanleaning states of Montana Ohio and West Virginia all of which were won comfortably by Trump in both 2016 and 2020. 29 Other potential Republican targets include seats in Arizona Michigan Nevada Pennsylvania Wisconsin and Maryland while Democrats may target Republicanheld seats in Florida and Texas. 30  Two special elections are scheduled to fill the unexpired terms of senators who vacated their seats during the 118th Congress All 435 voting seats in the United States House of Representatives will be up for election. Additionally elections will be held to select the nonvoting members who represent the District of Columbia and all five permanentlyinhabited U.S. territories in the House of Representatives. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives following the 2022 U.S. House elections. 36  Five special elections to the House of Representatives are scheduled to be held in 2024. Elections will be held for the governorships of eleven of the fifty U.S. states and two U.S. territories. Special elections may be held for vacancies in the other states and territories if required by respective state or territorial constitutions. Ten states will hold attorney general elections. Most legislative chambers will hold regularlyscheduled elections in 2024. The exceptions are the Michigan Senate Minnesota Senate and both legislative chambers in the states of Alabama Louisiana Maryland Mississippi New Jersey and Virginia. In chambers that use staggered terms only a portion of the seats in the chamber will be up for election. In addition to gubernatorial elections various other executive and judicial positions will hold elections at the state level in 2024. A number of major U.S. cities have held mayoral elections in 2024 In January the Fort McDowell Yavapai Nation elected Sandra Pattea tribal president 69 ousting longterm tribal leader Bernadine Burnette who first joined the tribal council in 1992. 70 Also in January the Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community elevated Cole Miller from vice chair to tribal chairman. 71  In February the Confederated Tribes of Coos Lower Umpqua and Siuslaw Indians elected Doug Barrett tribal chief in a special election to fill the remainder of Donald Doc Slyters term which expires in April 2030. Slyter died in November 2023. 72 73  In March the Apache Tribe of Oklahoma reelected Durell Cooper III as tribal chairman. 74  In June the Cherokee Nation will hold a referendum on whether or not to hold a constitutional convention to amend or replace the tribe s constitution. Also in June the Osage Nation will consider a constitutional amendment about executive appointments. 74  This table shows the partisan results of presidential congressional gubernatorial and state legislative races held in each state and territory in 2024. Note that not all states and territories hold gubernatorial state legislative and Senate elections in 2024. The five territories and Washington D.C. do not elect members of the Senate and the territories do not take part in presidential elections instead they each elect one nonvoting member of the House. Nebraskas unicameral legislature and the governorship and legislature of American Samoa are elected on a nonpartisan basis and political party affiliation is not listed. The election campaign has been marked by widespread doxxing swatting and threats against politicians and activists with a particular series of incidents starting in December 2023. 77 78 79

AP PhotoMatt Rourke A ballot question asking voters if the Philadelphia Home Rule Charter should be amended to require the city to help registered community organizations RCOs pay the costs of lawsuits was approved by voters Tuesday. RCOs provide input when a landowner requests an exception from standard zoning rules called a variance. RCOs have faced lawsuits related to their participation in the variance request process. A statement from the city government on the ballot question says these can be costly and limit community input.  For example in 2013 the Old City Civic Association dissolved after repeated lawsuits led its insurance carrier to drop the group and it couldn t get new insurance. Another RCO the Greater Bustleton Civic League saw premiums increase 12fold last year. According to WHYY s Billy Penn developers sometimes sue the officers of RCOs who oppose projects or ask for concessions. The suits may or may not have legal merit and are sometimes described as strategic lawsuits against public participation or SLAPPs meant to intimidate critics. Amendments to the Home Rule Charter must be adopted by City Council and then approved by voters. Former Council President Darrell Clarke introduced the amendment in October and Council unanimously approved it in November. Supporters of the measure say it is welcomed news for RCOs in the city while detractors say it gives community organizations a blank check to fight developers.

Emma LeeWHYY Election Day has come and gone. Here s what happened yesterday in Pennsylvania s 2024 primary election See primary election results as votes continue to be tallied Sean Dougherty is a Democratic candidate for the Pa. state Houses 172nd district. Campaign Incumbent Kevin Boyle lost his primary bid for the Pennsylvania House to Sean Dougherty who was backed by Boyle s colleagues. By the time the race was called for Dougherty at 1045 p.m. Tuesday he had amassed a 40 margin of victory over Boyle. Dougherty is the nephew of oncepowerful labor leader John Dougherty who was convicted of fraud and embezzlement late last year. Boyle who has served in the Pennsylvania House since 2011 ran for reelection despite his caucus backing Dougherty. The House Democratic Campaign Committee organized a petitionsigning event in February and added 72000 to Dougherty s campaign account. Many have expressed concerns about Boyle s mental health including his brother U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle. Boyle entered the primary after a drunken tirade at a Montgomery County bar earlier this year where he allegedly threatened to hit female employees and vowed to end the bar. An arrest warrant was issued for Boyle last week for violating a restraining order but it was withdrawn on Monday. In 2021 days before his arrest for violating a protection from abuse order Democratic leaders in Harrisburg stripped Boyle of his committee chairmanship and limited his access to the Capitol. ThenGov. Tom Wolf also called for his resignation. Democratic treasurer candidate Erin McClelland. Courtesy of candidate Facebook page Small business owner Erin McClelland won Tuesday s primary election to snag the Democratic nomination for Pennsylvania treasurer a surprise victory that sets the stage for a tough matchup this fall with incumbent Republican Stacy Garrity. The Associated Press called the race for McClelland at 1011 p.m. Unofficial results show McClelland with 56 of the vote to opponent Ryan Bizzarro s 44. McClelland won Tuesday s election without the endorsement of the state Democratic Party it backed Bizzarro a state representative from Erie.

Kenyatta was elected in 2018 becoming the first openly LGBTQ person to serve in either chamber of the state General Assembly.

Malcolm Kenyatta the winner in the Democratic primary for the 181st state House of Representatives district. The Philadelphia native is also currently in the lead for the Democratic nomination for auditor general a race in which he s facing off state Rep. Ryan Bizzarro. If he ultimately succeeds he will run against Republican incumbent Timothy DeFoor in November. In Pennsylvania candidates can run for a statewide and a district seat at the same time meaning Kenyatta did not have to give up his General Assembly seat representing North Philly which he s held since 2018 to run for auditor general. The outspoken progressive was the first openly LGBTQ person of color to hold a seat in the General Assembly and ran for the U.S. Senate seat now occupied by John Fetterman. State Rep.

Maria PulcinellaWHYY Hope Foy a millennial living in Southwest Philly voted for Biden in the Democratic presidential primary but she wasn t too excited about it. That s because he failed to deliver on his promises of student loan forgiveness she said.  I m still paying on a monthly basis Foy said outside of a polling place at Longstreth Elementary School. I m really looking forward to seeing some real change that ll affect not only different generations but my generation as well.  Foy who works in the biotech industry is also concerned about equitable housing opportunities and food insecurity. She recently tried to buy her first investment property but housing prices put it out of reach.  The housing market is trash right now she said. Definitely looking forward to some of those issues changing.  Jeffrey Cooper is also feeling the crunch. He worked at the polling place at Longstreth and said politicians aren t doing enough to address everyday issues like the economy.  What candidate is really doing something for the people? Cooper said. When you ve got a loaf of bread that costs 5 no one s really addressing the issue of getting the stress up off of people that are working today.  Michelle Currica Hernandez a Southwest Philly resident who works in grantmaking voted uncommitted in the Democratic presidential primary to send Biden a message that she disapproves of his handling of Israel s war in Gaza.  This is an election where you re actually able to make a political and an activist stance and it s reported up the chain she said. I don t think it s safe to do in November but I think of any time that we have the ability to make a statement this is the time to do it.  Still Currica Hernandez is worried about the general election in November when Biden will face Trump. She focused on picking a candidate for the Pennsylvania attorney general race she thinks could fend off a challenge to Pa. s election results this fall and worries about turnout. Other topofmind issues for Currica Hernandez include gun violence Republican rhetoric around immigration safe public spaces in Southwest Philly and transportation.  Just feeling a little stressed by voting knowing the consequences of today s election and how the ballot will look in November she said. Left Sen.

Kimberly PaynterWHYY Polls have closed in Pennsylvania s 2024 primary election. Voters weighed in on races for attorney general auditor general treasurer and the U.S. House among others. Follow along as WHYY News tracks primary election results this evening. Tanya ONeill 58 says her ideal candidate for attorney general is someone who wants to be a public servant rather than someone seeking out the prestige of the office. Kenny CooperWHYY With less than an hour before polls close voters in the suburbs of Philadelphia are still thinking a lot about the Pennsylvania attorney general s race. And with no official endorsement on the Democratic ticket voters did a lot of research. Dominic Polumbo 25 pulled out a written breakdown of candidates from the League of Women Voters as he stood in front of his polling location at the Abington Art Center. He said he voted for Keir BradfordGrey.  I wanted to vote for somebody that was local and somebody that had a more progressive stance on the law so protecting women s rights Polumbo said. Tanya O Neill 58 opted not to share who she voted for but she said the choice was easy. She heard the candidates speak at her church.  I was really looking for someone who came across as authentic and who is willing to really roll up their sleeves and do the work O Neill said. I feel like there are folks out there who are running for office now for the prestige of the office whereas when I was coming of age and first voting I felt like people actually ran for office because they truly truly believed in being a public servant.   We have to walk the talk like my father used to say don t complain if you re not going to be part of the solution. So at least I get the right to complain O Neill said. Joanna Kallan is a Democratic committee person in Abington. She says turnout in the primary has been lower than usual. Kenny CooperWHYY Low turnout in a primary contest or an offelection cycle is expected. However polling locations in Philadelphia s suburbs were unusually quiet on Tuesday. The Abington Art Center tends to be busier than most locations in Montgomery County. But this primary election it is a different story.  There s been a pretty slow turnout. I ve been here for a lot of the day and we just haven t had nearly as many people as usual said Joanna Kallan a Democratic committee person for District 72 in Abington. But we don t know how many people are voting by mail.  The polling location which usually attracts around 300 voters during a regular primary contest probably won t reach the 200 mark. Nevertheless Kallan said she s pretty confident that energy will be high in November for the general election. David Harrison drops off his mail ballot for the Pennsylvania primary election in Newtown Square Pa. Monday May 2 2022. AP PhotoMatt Rourke With most nominees for federal offices already decided there s not much to be decided today when looking forward to November says Marc Meredith professor of political science at the University of Pennsylvania. Meredith told WHYY News that is because of the closed primaries.  What we really want to know which we won t be able to get much of a sense of from tonight is how are the more independent minded voters or people who are more swing voters who might not show up in primaries how are they going to vote? he said. Polling suggests that voters in Pennsylvania aren t enthusiastic. So can turnout in the primaries be used to figure out which candidate s supporters are more excited about their own candidate?  People will look at today and compare it to 2020 but it s a little bit of an apples to oranges comparison he said. 2020 was such a weird primary election given when it fell and in the middle of the George Floyd protest and all that so ultimately I think there s not going to be much to be learned from making that comparison.  Incumbents in the 1st 2nd and 3rd Congressional districts are being primaried but they are not likely to lose today. Therefore the stories will play out in the coming months. Instead Meredith is looking much more closely at the races for state treasurer state auditor and especially attorney general. Three candidates are running to unseat Stacy Garrity the incumbent Republican state treasurer including two Democrats and a member of the Forward Party. Two Democrats are running for auditor general for which Republican Timothy DeFoor is running for reelection. Meredith says the AG race is the most interesting as eight candidates run for an open seat.  Anytime you have a race like that in Pennsylvania where it s an open seat it s going to be a competitive election in the end he said.

AP PhotoAlex Brandon The BidenHarris campaign observed Primary Day by opening 10 more field offices including three in Philadelphia rapidly building up for the general election. Several prominent local Democrats assembled at one of the new locations where Rep. Dwight Evans stressed the importance of the expanded presence.  It s up to all of us to meet voters where they are including right here in North Philly and make sure that we reject Donald Trump and Republicans and elect President Biden and Democrats up and down the ballot said U.S. Rep. Dwight Evans. Campaign field offices typically serve as bases and training centers for door knocking and phone banking. The new offices bring the total number in the state up to 24. Meanwhile the Trump campaign doesn t appear to have any fulltime presence in the state and the candidate has only appeared once in the eastern part of the state at a rally that drew several thousand supporters. Biden on the other hand has visited several times including three stops just last week. Still the Biden campaign is pushing against polling which continues to show a dead heat between the two candidates as well as lower enthusiasm for the incumbent. Some Democrats have expressed concern that may translate into too many voters in reliably blue districts such as Philadelphia staying home in November. State Senator and Chairman of the Pennsylvania Democratic Party Sharif Street pushed the idea that the heightened presence now with four field offices in the city will go beyond correcting that.  Make no mistake massive turnout in the city of Philadelphia will make the difference in making sure that Joe Biden is reelected president and while we re doing that we will make sure Bob Casey will be reelected to the United States Senate Street said. According to state campaign officials the campaign tripled its staff in the state made nearly 20000 calls and texts to supporters and reached out to another 19000 voters by knocking on doors this month so far.

Sophia SchmidtWHYY Voting in Pennsylvania s primary election appears to be going smoothly today according to election integrity monitors with only a few reports of minor hiccups amid apparently low turnout through midafternoon. Voters have been calling in various typical problems to election protection hotlines. Those include errors in mail ballots such as incorrect handwritten dates that they must fix by the close of voting at 8 p.m. if their votes are to count representatives of Common Cause Pennsylvania and the ACLU of Pennsylvania said this afternoon.  As with any election day there are always a few issues that crop up said Philip HensleyRobin Common Cause PA s executive director. We re fortunate and happy to see that there aren t any big systemic issues in the reports that we re getting in from around the state.  Among the specific reports they ve received are of the slightly delayed opening of a polling place at Seafarers Union Hall in the 39th Ward in South Philadelphia. It did not open at the official 7 a.m. starting time for voting but opened shortly thereafter. The Philadelphia District Attorney s Office Election Task Force also hasn t seen any significant problems despite a false alarm earlier in the day a spokesperson for DA Larry Krasner said.

Kimberly PaynterWHYY Most polling places in Philadelphia are manned by longtime residents who have worked Election Day for years. Inside the school s cavernous gymnasium on Tuesday where six divisions cast their ballots nearly all of the poll workers were teenagers. Some Lincoln students. Others recent grads.  The kids know what they re doing here they get good reviews here. The adults who are here with them always give us very positive feedback.

READ MORE The kids are alright At a Philly polling place teens are running the show Samah Elhajibrahim who earned her PhD at Penn voted Uncommitted in the Democratic presidential primary Tuesday in order to send President Biden a message. Sophia SchmidtWHYY Outside a polling place on the University of Pennsylvania s campus a small group of people urged students entering the building to write in Uncommitted rather than cast a vote for President Joe Biden in the presidential primary race. They hope to send a message to Biden that they reject U.S. support for Israel during the country s war in Gaza which has killed more than 34000 Palestinians since the Oct. 7 attack by Hamas.  For way too long the Democratic Party has just accepted that they ll have the Muslim vote said Rayane a student who is a registered independent and could not vote in Tuesday s primary. Rayane declined to provide a last name for fear of retribution. I don t know if we have enough power to put someone into office but I think it speaks volumes if we have enough power to take someone out.  Uncommitted PA a group formed to encourage Democratic Pennsylvania voters not to support Biden in the primary joins a movement in other states that saw more than 100000 Democratic primary voters in Michigan cast Uncommitted votes. The Pennsylvania group is calling for an immediate and permanent ceasefire in Gaza and for the U.S. to stop sending aid to Israel and reinstate funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East UNWRA. They hope to organize at least 40000 Uncommitted writein votes Tuesday. Biden won the swing state by just over 80000 votes in 2020. Samah Elhajibrahim a recent PhD graduate at Penn voted Uncommitted in the Democratic presidential primary Tuesday as well as in other downballot races where Democratic incumbents have not pushed for a ceasefire.  Genocide is taking place and we are part of this in the United States Elhajibrahim said. It s our weapons. It s our taxes. We can t just pretend that it s not on us. We have power. We have agency and this is the time to do it.  Elhajibrahim who is Palestinian said she has not yet decided whether she ll support Biden in November s general election when he ll face Republican Donald Trump.  The fact that that s our choice and we call it a democracy is ridiculous she said. We don t have real choices. The only agenda the Democrats are putting forward is Oh do you want Trump? It s a scary fear. That s all they do and I m kind of tired of that. I have to vote my conscience. If I vote for a Democrat again it s pretty much sending them a message that they can keep on doing what they re doing.  Rayane plans to vote independent or third party in November s general election.  I don t think it can be worse than actively perpetuating the slaughter of thousands and thousands of people she said. State Rep. Chris Rabb sat near the Uncommitted PA group Tuesday afternoon. He showed up to support young people protesting he said. He declined to say whether he supported Uncommitted PA s specific demands.  These types of nonviolent civil disobedience direct actions organizing this is what s made our country better he said. I don t think we should be supporting the state of Israel as long as they re doing what they re doing.

It focuses on the states that are expected to be most competitive in the effort by the campaigns to get to 270 electoral votes a majority of the 538 total available. Trump holds slight advantages in most of the swing states right now according to averages of the polls. Strictly going by the polls Trump would have a 283255 lead if you give Biden Pennsylvania and Wisconsin which are currently statistical ties. But the toss up states are expected to be close within just a few points in either candidate s direction. Biden currently has a massive war chest and adspending advantage.

Emma LeeWHYY Philadelphia voters at the polls on Tuesday are looking at a primary ballot without a lot of choices at the top of the ticket. Candidates for the presidency and the U.S. Senate are running unopposed in both parties. Because Pennsylvania is a closed primary state only voters affiliated with a party are able to vote. Independents cannot weigh in except on the ballot question. Nevertheless voters like Robert Greenstein felt compelled to have their voices heard.  Gotta vote. Got to let the world know we want to vote he said. It s so important.  There are five Democratic candidates vying to be attorney general and two Republican candidates. However some voters saw little difference among their choices.  It was hard said Nancy Barton who voted in Old City with her husband. A bunch of them seemed very good. It was hard looking at all the different choices because a lot of them were in line with what we believe in.  For Cindy Hoffman also in Old City the AG race was essentially a coin toss.  That was the one that I had the absolute hardest choice with she said. I had literally narrowed it down to two and of the two I would be happy with either candidate.  Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick RPa. speaks during a campaign event at the Load Rite Trailers manufacturing facility in Fairless Hills Pa. Monday Sept. 17 2018. AP PhotoMatt Rourke In addition to the attorney general auditor general and treasurer contests voters in the Keystone State will also decide on a handful of federal races. All 435 House seats across the country are up for election. In many of these primary bids incumbent candidates are running uncontested races. But in Bucks County U.S. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is looking to fend off a challenger from his right. The selfdescribed moderate Republican has served Pennsylvania s 1st congressional district since 2017. Rightwing Republican Mark Houck a vocal antiabortion activist is not the first candidate to primary Fitzpatrick but he hopes to be the first to win. The victor of the Republican primary will face Democratic challenger Ashley Ehasz. Fitzpatrick defeated her in the 2022 general election by nine percentage points. As the last Republican House member in Philadelphia s suburbs Fitzpatrick s political viability is wearing thin in a county that has turned more blue than purple over the last decade. First elected in 2016 Fitzpatrick has built a reputation as the quintessential moderate Republican. He grew up in Levittown and received an undergraduate degree from La Salle University. He later earned an MBA and a law degree from Penn State University. After graduating he spent time as a judicial clerk in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Before his tenure in Congress Fitzpatrick was most known for his nearly 15year stint at the Federal Bureau of Investigation where he served as an FBI supervisory special agent. He led the FBI s Public Corruption Unit and was the national director of the bureau s Campaign Finance and Election Crimes Enforcement Program. Fitzpatrick also worked as a special assistant to the U.S. attorney.  READ MORE Race to watch In Bucks County U.S. Rep.

In the race for auditor general three candidates will be on the ballot during Pennsylvania s upcoming primary election on April 23. Republican Auditor General Timothy DeFoor who is wrapping up his first term is running for reelection. Without a Republican challenger the incumbent is on the fast track to be on the November ballot. However the Democratic primary is not a onecandidate race. Democratic voters in Pennsylvania will have two choices state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta of Philadelphia and Lehigh County Controller Mark Pinsley. Since 1809 Pennsylvania s auditor general has served as the chief fiscal watchdog of the ommonwealth ensuring state tax dollars are properly managed and spent. From performing audits to attestation engagements the auditor general is central to holding the government accountable for taxpayer dollars. In recent years the office has gained a knack for capturing headlines. In 2017 former Democratic Auditor General Eugene DePasquale found that Pennsylvania s fuel tax meant for bridge repair got diverted to state police instead. In 2023 DeFoor accused a handful of Philadelphiaarea school districts of a taxation shell game .

Members of each party determined which candidates will go on to the general election in November. Candidates for president U.S. House and Senate attorney general auditor general and treasurer were on the ballot.

Democratic Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger David McCormick will face each other in Pennsylvania s highstakes U.S. Senate contest this fall. Tuesday s primary election put the men on track for an expensive race that s expected to help decide Senate control in the Nov. 5 election. Casey is seeking a fourth term while McCormick is a twotime Senate challenger and a former hedge fund CEO who lost narrowly in 2022 s sevenway GOP primary. McCormick s candidacy is shaping up as Casey s strongest challenge in his three reelection bids. President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump won their party nominations easily after all major rivals dropped out. Both men made campaign trips to swingstate Pennsylvania in recent days and voters can expect to see plenty of them their TV ads and their surrogates campaigning over the next six months in a state that swung from Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020. Of note however could be the number of uncommitted writein votes cast in the Democratic primary to protest Biden s handling of the IsraelHamas war. ABC News reports that Philadelphia State Rep. Malcom Kenyatta is projected to win in the Democratic Auditor General primary. He will face Republican incumbent Timothy DeFoor in November who ran unopposed today.

Brian Fitzpatrick won as he faced a primary challenge from Mark Houck an antiabortion activist.  Breaking news and the stories that matter to your neighborhood. On the Democratic side Ashley Ehasz who lost to Fitzpatrick in the 2022 general election for the same seat ran unopposed and faced the Republican winner in the fall.  In the Lehigh Valleys 7th District three Republicans Kevin Dellicker Ryan Mackenzie and Maria Montero ran to take on Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild in the fall. Wild ran unopposed in the Democratic primary.  Wild won the general election over Republican Lisa Scheller by a tight 5149 margin in 2022. She has been the Congresswoman from the region since 2018.  Ryan Mackenzie won during Tuesday nights primary and will face Wild in November.  In the 3rd District which contains a wide swath of Philadelphia from the northwest to the west to the south threeterm Congressman Dwight Evans won after facing a primary challenge from Tracey Gordon. Gordon the citys former Register of Wills lost a primary for that job in 2022 and had been mired in controversy during her time in office. The 3rd District is dominated by Democrats and is one of the bluest districts in the nation according to the Cook Political Report. Nobody ran for the seat in the Republican primary.  Democrats and Republicans including several incumbents ran unopposed in their primaries in the 2nd District 4th District 5th District and 6th District. All four of those seats are currently held by Democrats. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro vacated the Attorney Generals office in 2023 as he ramped up his election campaign for his new job. The current AG Michelle Henry was appointed by Shapiro to finish his term and is not running to keep the position.  Two Republicans and five Democrats ran in the primaries for the right to battle for the seat in November.  Former auditor general of Pennsylvania Eugene DePasquale won on Tuesday nights primary.  On the Republican side York County DA Dave Sunday ran against Craig Williams a member of the Pa. House from the 160th District in Delco and Chester Counties. Sunday won and will face DePasquale in November.  Democrats ran against each other in the primary elections for two other key statewide offices Auditor General the states chief fiscal officer and Treasurer. Pa. state representative Malcolm Kenyatta won in the race for Auditor General against Mark Pinsley who is the current controller in Lehigh County.  For treasurer Pa. state rep Ryan Bizzarro from Erie County ran against Erin McClelland an addiction counselor and businesswoman who unsuccessfully ran for Congress in 2012 and 2016.  Republicans hold both seats currently and the incumbents ran unopposed. Tim Defoor of Dauphin County ran for reelection as Auditor General and Stacy Garrity of Bradford County ran for her second fouryear term as treasurer.  President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump both won after going before voters Tuesday in Pennsylvania s presidential primaries a prelude to the November general election when the commonwealth is expected to once again play a critical role in the race for the White House. Further down the ballot voters also selected nominees in competitive primaries for Congress the state legislature and three statewide offices. Biden clinched the Democratic nomination and Trump clinched the Republican nomination on March 12 and neither faces serious opposition on the primary ballot. Nonetheless both presumptive nominees have campaigned in Pennsylvania in recent days with their focus more on the November election and each other than on Tuesday s vote. Biden just completed a threeday campaign swing that began last Tuesday in his hometown of Scranton and concluded Thursday in Philadelphia in an event with members of the Kennedy family. Days earlier Trump held a rally in Lehigh County his third visit to the state this year. Pennsylvania is also home to a competitive U.S. Senate contest but Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey and Republican David McCormick both ran unopposed in Tuesdays primary.  The Casey vs. McCormick showdown in Novembers general election will be one of the most hotlycontested races of the fall cycle.

https://www.cbsnews.com/philadelphia/news/pennsylvania-primary-election-results-2024/,  By The Associated Press   Updated on April 24 2024 1209 AM EDT CBSAP  The battleground states primary election is relatively late and Republican Donald Trump is currently running unopposed since former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley suspended her 2024 GOP presidential campaign in early March. Democrat Joe Biden is also running unopposed in the primary. This comes as his remaining challenger Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesota dropped his longshot Democratic primary bid against Biden in early March.  Democrat U.S. Sen. Bob Casey did not face a primary opponent and neither did Republican challenger David McCormick. Control of the U.S. Senate is on the line in 2024 and Caseys bid for a fourth term is expected to be one of the nations most expensive and closely watched races. All 17 incumbents nine Democrats and eight Republicans are running for reelection in Pennsylvanias 17 congressional seats. Only a handful of the seats are expected to be competitive in the November general election. In the primary just five have a direct challenger from within their party Democratic Rep. Dwight Evans of Philadelphia Pittsburgharea Democratic U.S. Rep. Summer Lee and Republican U.S. Reps. Mike Kelly of Butler and Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Bucks County. In the 3rd District Evans defeated Philadelphia Register of Wills Tracey Gordon the Associated Press projects.

In the 7th District in eastern Pennsylvania three Republicans were vying for the nomination to challenge Democratic U.S. Rep. Susan Wild of Allentown. State Rep.

https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/23/2024-pennsylvania-primary-election-guide/73383956007/, The primary results in this pivotal swing state are certain to reveal insights about the major issues shaping the general election namely on abortion and the IsraelHamas war. All 17 members of Pennsylvania s congressional delegation are running for reelection in 2024 and three of those incumbents are facing serious primary challengers. Several others are also watching to see who their opponent will be in the fall. And in some cases the outcome of Tuesday s races could determine which way those seats swing on Election Day.  At the state level Democrats are hoping to hold on to their majority in the state House and take control of the state Senate. Republicans currently hold a 2822 majority in the Senate and Democrats are hoping to flip at least three seats to make it 2525 giving them the majority via a tiebreaking vote from Democratic Lieutenant Gov. Austin Davis.  Heres a look at what to expect in Tuesdays primary.  Abortion has roiled downballot races across the country and Pennsylvania is no exception. Reproductive rights have been a major topic in the attorney general s race and in the Republican primary for the 1st Congressional District.  In Pennsylvania s 1st Congressional District longtime Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick is being challenged on his right flank by a candidate who believes abortions should be banned in nearly all circumstances including in cases of rape and incest.  Fitzpatrick is a moderate Republican. He is one of a handful of Republican representatives serving in districts that Biden won in 2020.  Lee who is affiliated with the squad was among the early advocates in Congress calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. She has been an outspoken opponent of providing U.S. military aid to Israel.  Patel is a 29yearold municipal council member who also describes herself as a progressive. She has framed the incumbents criticism of Israel as detrimental to Biden s reelection efforts and unrepresentative of a district that is home to a large Jewish community.  The election on Tuesday could reveal just how salient the issue of the war is for Democratic voters particularly in swing areas of the country. It may also forecast how other progressives facing similar challenges from moderate Democrats could fair in their races.  There are several other highprofile House primary races to watch in Pennsylvania.  Six Democrats are competing for the chance to challenge GOP Rep. Scott Perry in Pennsylvania s 10th Congressional District which includes Harrisburg and Hershey.  While the area leans Republican Democrats say they can win over independents and moderate conservatives in the area with a message centered around protecting democracy. They plan to tie Perry to Trump and conservative extremism.  Out of the six Democratic candidates running to unseat Perry news anchor Janelle Stelson and former Top Gun fighter pilot Mike O Brien appear to have the best shot. The other candidates include Harrisburg City Council member Shamaine Daniels progressive businessman John Broadhurst and former radio executive Black Lynch.  To the northeast of Harrisburg in the Lehigh Valley three Republicans are competing to take on Democratic Rep. Susan Wild. Her seat in Pennsylvania s 7th District is a top target for Republicans in November.  Wild barely eked out a victory against her Republican opponent Lisa Scheller in 2022. She won 5149.  If Pennsylvania Democrats hold their narrow majority in the state House and win the state Senate in November it would give Gov. Shapiro enormous power to pass his agenda in the last two years of his term.  It would also mark the first time in three decades that the party controlled the state Senate Tuesday s elections could determine whether that s possible.  Because the local districts tend to lean Democratic or Republican the results of the primary elections can have a large sway on the race.  Democrats currently hold a twoseat majority in the state House and Republicans hold a fiveseat majority in the state Senate. 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_States_presidential_election, Joe BidenDemocratic The 2024 United States presidential election will be the 60th quadrennial presidential election set to be held on Tuesday November 5 2024. 1 Voters will elect a president and vice president for a term of four years. Incumbent President Joe Biden a member of the Democratic Party is running for reelection. 2 His predecessor Donald Trump a member of the Republican Party is running for reelection for a second nonconsecutive term after losing to him in 2020. 3 The election notably comes after Trumps prior attempts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the January 6 United States Capitol attack. 4 5 6 This will mark the first presidential rematch since 1956. If Trump wins he would become the second president to serve a nonconsecutive term the first being Grover Cleveland. 7  The winner of this election is scheduled to be inaugurated on January 20 2025. It will occur at the same time as elections relating to the U.S. Senate House gubernatorial and state legislative. On March 12 Biden and Trump became the presumptive nominees for the Democratic and Republican parties respectively by clinching a majority of delegates although they have yet to be confirmed at the nominating conventions. 8 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. emerged as the highestpolling thirdparty presidential candidate since Ross Perot 9 in the 1992 and 1996 elections running as an independent. 10 11 12  Article Two of the United States Constitution states that for a person to serve as president the individual must be a naturalborn citizen of the United States be at least 35 years old and have been a United States resident for at least 14 years. The Twentysecond Amendment forbids any person from being elected president more than twice. Major party candidates seek the nomination through a series of primary elections that select the delegates who choose the candidate at the partys national convention. Each partys national convention chooses a vice presidential running mate to form that partys ticket. The nominee for president usually picks the running mate who is then ratified by the delegates at the partys convention. The general election in November is an indirect election in which voters cast ballots for a slate of members of the Electoral College these electors then directly elect the president and vice president. 28  Election offices are dealing with increased workloads and public scrutiny so officials in many key states have sought for more funds to hire more personnel improve security and extend training. This demand emerges at a moment when numerous election offices are dealing with an increase in retirements and a flood of public record demands owing in part to the electoral mistrust planted by former President Donald Trumps loss in the 2020 election. Both Biden and Trump are presumptive nominees for president in 2024 suggesting a rematch of the 2020 election which would be the first presidential rematch since 1956. 29 If Trump is elected he would become the second president to win a second nonconsecutive term joining Grover Cleveland who did so in 1892. 30  The Colorado Supreme Court 31 a state Circuit Court in Illinois 32 and the Secretary of State of Maine 33 ruled that Trump is ineligible to hold office under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack and as such attempted to disqualify him from appearing on the ballot. 34 33 However on March 4 the United States Supreme Court unanimously ruled that states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section 3. 35  Donald Trump has made false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and has continued denying the election results as of February 2024 update . 36 37 Election security experts have warned that officials who deny the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election may attempt to impede the voting process or refuse to certify the 2024 election results. 38  Current and former U.S. officials have stated that foreign interference in the 2024 election is likely. Three major factors cited were America s deepening domestic political crises the collapse of controversial attempts to control political speech on social media and the rise of generative AI. 39 On April 1 2024 The New York Times reported that the Chinese government had created fake proTrump accounts on social media promoting conspiracy theories stoking domestic divisions and attacking President Biden ahead of the election in November. 40 According to disinformation experts and intelligence agencies Russia spread disinformation ahead of the 2024 election to damage Joe Biden and Democrats boost candidates supporting isolationism and undercut support for Ukraine aid and NATO. 41 42  This will be the first U.S. presidential election to occur after the reapportionment of votes in the United States Electoral College following the 2020 United States census. 43 44 If the results of the 2020 election were to stay the same which has never occurred in the history of presidential elections in 2024 Democrats would have 303 electoral votes against the Republicans 235 a slight change from Bidens 306 electoral votes and Trumps 232 meaning that Democrats lost a net of 3 electoral votes to the reapportionment process. This apportionment of electoral college votes will remain only through the 2028 election. Reapportionment will be conducted again after the 2030 United States census. 45  In recent presidential elections most states are not competitive due to demographics keeping them solidly behind one of the major parties. Because of the nature of the Electoral College this means that the various swing states competitive states that swing between the Democratic and Republican parties are vital to winning the presidency. As of now these include states in the Rust Belt such as Wisconsin Michigan and Pennsylvania and states in the Sun Belt such as Nevada Arizona and Georgia. 46 North Carolina may also be considered a battleground state due to the close result in the previous presidential election in which Trump only won by 1.34. 47 Due to gradual demographic shifts some former swing states such as Iowa Ohio and Florida have shifted significantly towards the Republicans favoring them in future statewide and local elections. Meanwhile states like Colorado New Mexico and Virginia have moved noticeably towards the Democrats and the party has become the dominant political force there. 48 49 50  The Democratic electoral coalition securing the blue states for Democratic presidential candidates performs best among Jewish and Black voters 51 52 Whites who have attended college 53 or live in urban areas. 54 Working class voters were also a mainstay of the Democratic coalition since the days of the New Deal but since the 1970s many have defected to Republicans as the Democratic Party moved significantly to the left on cultural issues. 55 Conversely the traditional Republican coalition that dominates many red states is mainly composed of rural White voters evangelicals the elderly and noncollege educated voters. 56 Republicans have also historically performed well with suburban middle class voters since the 1950s but this bloc has drifted away from them in recent years due to the rise of the Tea Party movement and later the Make America Great Again movement. 57 The acceleration of this trend has been credited with tipping the 2020 presidential election in favor of Democrat Joe Biden because the incumbent Trump was historically unpopular in the suburbs for a Republican candidate underperforming there significantly. 58  Some polling for this election has indicated that Democratic strength among Hispanic Asian Arab and youth voters appears to have somewhat eroded while Republicans durability with Whites and voters over the age of 65 also appears to be slipping. 59 60 61 62 63 However some political analysts 64 have argued that these apparent trends in polling are not representative of the actual electorate and are a polling mirage resulting from poor sampling months before the election large numbers of voters who do not think the election will be between Biden and Trump 65 and heavy nonresponse bias. 66 67 68 69 Other pollsters such as YouGov have shown no statistically significant generational or racial depolarization among the electorate. 70 71  Abortion access is expected to be a key topic during the campaign. This is the first presidential election to be held in the aftermath of two major court rulings that affected access to abortion. The first is the 2022 Dobbs v. Jackson Womens Health Organization decision in which the United States Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade leaving abortion law entirely to the states including bans on abortion. 72 The second is the 2023 Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration in which a federal judge in northwest Texas overturned the FDAs approval of mifepristone in 2000 which could potentially pull the medication from the market if upheld by higher courts. 73 Both rulings have received strong support from Republican politicians and lawmakers. 72 73  Democrats are predominantly supportive of viewing abortion access as a right 74 while Republican politicians generally favor significantly restricting the legality of abortion. 75 By April 2023 a large majority of Republicancontrolled states had passed neartotal bans on abortion rendering it largely illegal throughout much of the United States. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation there are 15 states that have de jure early stage bans on abortion without exceptions for rape or incest. 72  Biden has called on Congress to codify abortion protections into federal law and held many rallies on the issue. 76 77 Trump has claimed credit for overturning Roe but has criticized Republicans pushing for total abortion bans. 78 79  Polling has shown that border security and immigration are among the top issues concerning potential voters in the 2024 presidential election. 80 81 In 2023 and 2024 a surge of migrants entering the country through the United States border with Mexico occurred. 82 In response to the influx of migrants Republican controlled states such as Texas and Florida have been busing migrants to major sanctuary cities controlled by Democrats such as New York and Chicago. 83 84  Donald Trump has stated that if elected he would increase deportations send the U.S. military to the border expand ICE detentions deputize local law enforcement to handle border security increase Customs and Border Patrol funding as well as finish building the wall on the southern border. 83 The Biden administration has undertaken a policy of punishing migrants who enter the country illegally and providing temporary protections to migrants from certain countries such as Venezuela Ukraine Nicaragua Cuba and Haiti. This has resulted in a total increase in migrants legally arriving at points of entry and a decrease in migrants attempting to illegally cross the border. 83 In February 2024 Biden and congressional negotiators reached a bipartisan agreement on a bill to secure the border that included many conservative demands and also unlocked aid to Ukraine and Israel but the bill was opposed by Trump who claimed it would hurt Republicans ability to run on immigration as a campaign issue. 85 86 87 88 89 Biden has pushed back on Republican claims that he could secure the border without Congress. 90  Kennedy has stated that he supports securing the border including efforts like Operation Lone Star by states in the absence of federal action. 91  Climate change is expected to be an issue in the 2024 presidential election. 22  Biden has stated he believes in humancaused climate change. 92 Biden previously strengthened environmental protections that had been weakened during the Trump administration. Biden passed the Inflation Reduction Act the largest investment in addressing climate change and clean energy in US history. 93 Biden has also overseen a record in US crude oil production with over 13.2 million barrels of crude per day beating the 13 million barrels per day produced at the peak of Trumps presidency. Biden has previously stated his intention to lower prices at the gas pump which experts believe is key to his 2024 reelection campaign. 94 Bidens first term dealt with supply shocks caused by the 20212024 global energy crisis due to the COVID19 pandemic and Russian invasion of Ukraine. 95  Trump is running on a climate change denial platform. 96 97 98 Trump has repeatedly referred to his energy policy under the mantra drill baby drill 99 has promised to increase oil drilling on public lands and offer tax breaks to oil gas and coal producers. Trump has stated his goal for the U.S. to have the lowest cost of electricity and energy of any country in the world. 100 Trump has promised to rollback electric vehicle initiatives proposed leaving the Paris Climate Accords and rescinding several environmental regulations. 100 101  Joe Biden has been framing the election as a battle for democracy which was similar to his framing of contemporary geopolitics as the battle between democracy and autocracy. 102 Bidens rhetoric previously cited democracy and a battle for the soul of our nation as the key message of his 2020 presidential campaign and uses it as a recurring element in his rhetoric since the 2020 presidential election. 25  Polling before the election has indicated profound dissatisfaction with the state of American democracy. 103 104 105 Liberals tend to believe that conservatives are threatening the country with autocratic tendencies and their attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 106 Many Republicans are concerned that Trumps former impeachment and four criminal indictments are attempts to influence the election and keep him from office. 107  Donald Trumps 2024 campaign has been criticized by the media for making increasingly violent and authoritarian statements 108 109 110 which some believe the Trump campaign is intentionally leaning into. 111 Trumps previous comments suggesting he can terminate the Constitution to reverse his election loss 112 113 his claim that he would only be a dictator on day one of his presidency and not after a his promise to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies 120 attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election continued Republican efforts to restrict voting following the 2020 presidential election Trumps baseless predictions of vote fraud in the 2024 election 121 and Trumps public embrace and celebration of the January 6 United States Capitol attack 122 have raised concerns over the state of democracy in America. 111 123 124 125  Democracy is expected to be a large issue in the 2024 election. An APNORC poll of 1074 adults conducted between November 30 to December 4 2023 found that 62 of adults said democracy could be at risk depending on who wins the next election. 126  Voters consistently cite economic issues as their top issue for the 2024 election. 127 128 129 The COVID19 pandemic left behind significant economic effects which are likely to persist into 2024. 130 A period of high inflation began in 2021 caused by a confluence of events including the pandemic and a supplychain crisis which was then heightened by economic effects of Russias invasion of Ukraine in 2022. 131 132 Opinion polling over Bidens handling of the economy has consistently been negative since late 2021. 133  Women were particularly affected by the economic downturn in the wake of the pandemic particularly those who left their work for childcare responsibilities. 134 Temporary childcare measures including an expanded child tax credit as part of the American Rescue Plan were introduced as methods designed to help the economic situation of parents but these would expire before the 2024 election. 135  Both Biden and Trump signed pieces of economic legislation in their first terms which they may tout in the 2024 campaign. 136 Biden signed the American Rescue Plan 137 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act 138 Inflation Reduction Act 139 CHIPS and Science Act 140 and the Fiscal Responsibility Act. 141 Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 142 the CARES Act 143 and several executive orders providing for deregulation. 144  Biden has dubbed his economic policy Bidenomics and has promised to create middleclass jobs and reject trickledown economics. 145 Bidens trade agenda has been noted to reject traditional neoliberal economic policies and the Washington Consensus in favor of derisking supply chains from China and reverse neoliberal policies that resulted in the offshoring of manufacturing and thus resulted in increased populist backlash. 146 Trumps stated trade policy involves the United States decoupling from the global economy and having the country become more selfcontained and exerting its power through individual trade dealings. This would be accomplished through a universal baseline tariff 147 of perhaps 10 on most foreign goods with increased penalties if trade partners manipulate their currency or engage in unfair trade practices. Trump stated his plans to urge Congress to pass a Trump Reciprocal Trade Act to bestow presidential authority to impose a reciprocal tariff on any country that imposed one on the United States. 100 The Washington Post reported in January 2024 that Trump had discussed with advisors imposing a 60 tariff on all Chinese imports and was preparing for a massive trade war. 148 Trumps trade policies have been described as neomercantilist or autarkist. 147 149  Under the Biden administration several rounds of student loan forgiveness have been issued totaling over 132 billion. The forgiveness has largely focused on public servants people who were defrauded and people in repayment for long periods of time. 150 In August 2022 Biden announced he would sign an executive order that would forgive large amounts of student debt including 10000 for student loan debt for single graduates making less than 125000 or married couples making less than 250000 and 20000 for recipients of Pell Grants. 151 152 In June 2023 this plan was overturned in the Supreme Court decision Biden v. Nebraska. 153 154 In the aftermath of the decision Biden has continued with more limited student loan forgiveness. 150 His plans have been criticized by Republicans as irresponsible spending. 155 Biden stated that offering universal prekindergarten services as well as caregiver support would be a priority of a second term. 156  Some Republican candidates saw education as a winning campaign issue. Dozens of states have created laws preventing the instruction of critical race theory an academic discipline focused on the examination of racial inequality. Supporters of the laws claim that conversations about racial identity are not appropriate for a school environment. 157 158 17 Critics of the laws against critical race theory claim they whitewash American history and act as memory laws to rewrite public memory of U.S. history. 159 Trump has pledged to terminate the Department of Education 100 claiming it has been infiltrated by radical zealots and Marxists. 160  The ongoing Israel Hamas war and Russian invasion of Ukraine are expected to be significant issues of the election. 161  The United States has provided significant military and humanitarian aid to Ukraine throughout the Russian invasion of Ukraine. 162 163 164 Biden has made strengthening the NATO alliance and preparing for great power competition a cornerstone of his first term in office 165 and has promised to defend the NATO alliance during his second term. 166 Donald Trump claims that Ukraine and suppressing Russian intervention should not be a significant interest to the United States and that the plan should be more limited. 167 Trump previously stated he would potentially recognize Russias illegal annexation of Crimea 168 and made suggestions that he could have prevented the war by ceding parts of eastern Ukraine to Russia. 169 Trumps 2024 campaign has reiterated its isolationist America First foreign policy agenda 169 and has promised to fundamentally reevaluate NATOs purpose and mission. 100 Trump has stated he would encourage Russia to do whatever the hell they want to countries that did not contribute enough to NATO. 170  During the Israel Hamas war Biden announced unequivocal military support for Israel and condemned the actions of Hamas and other Palestinian militants as terrorism. 171 Biden has requested 10.6 billion dollars of aid for Israel to Congress. 172 Bidens support for Israel has been criticized by progressives and Muslim leaders many of whom have indicated they will not vote for Biden over the war. 173 By March 2024 Biden has become increasingly critical of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and has authorized air drops of aid and announced the construction of a military port to facilitate the delivery of aid to the enclave. 174 175 Kennedy condemned Hamas attacks on Israeli civilians and declared support for aid to Israel. 176 Trump has given mixed messages on the war pledging to support Israel and take a tough line on Iran while also criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and praising Hezbollah as very smart. 177 178  Polling has indicated a significant divide between government policy on the Israel Hamas war and the views of the general public. 179 A November 2023 poll had 68 of Americans agreeing with a statement that Israel should call a ceasefire and try to negotiate and a plurality opposed military aid to Israel favoring the United States as a neutral meditator. 179 A February 2024 Associated Press poll found that 44 saw Israel as a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with but doesnt share its interests and values while 35 saw Israel as an ally that shares U.S. interests and values. 50 of Americans believed Israel had gone too far in its response 31 thought Israel had been about right and 15 thought Israel had not gone far enough. 180 Young Americans are significantly less supportive of Israel than older generations. 181 182  Trump has made repealing the Affordable Care Act better known as Obamacare a key issue of the 2024 election. 16 The issue of healthcare and drug policy including whether the United States should shift to a universal healthcare system 183 and the COVID19 pandemic is expected to play a key role in the 2024 presidential election. 184 Kennedy has been a prominent antivaccine advocate but according to Deseret News he has attempted to moderate his antivaccine position before the election stating that he is not against all vaccines. 185 West is running on a platform of Medicareforall. 186 Biden has touted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 which expanded the Affordable Care Act and included provisions to reduce prescription drug prices for people on Medicare. 187  In recent years conservative politicians in state legislatures have introduced a large and growing number of bills that restrict the rights of LGBT people especially transgender people. 188 189  In his term as president Biden signed the Respect for Marriage Act which codified protections for samesex and interracial marriage into law. Additionally he has endorsed the Equality Act legislation aiming to extend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to offer protection on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation across various domains such as in the workplace housing and health care sectors. In 2023 Biden directed the federal government to provide strategies to states on how to enhance access to healthcare and suicide prevention resources for the LGBT community. 190  In a February 2023 campaign message Donald Trump said that if reelected he would enact a federal law that would recognize only two genders and claimed that being transgender is a concept made up by the radical left. 191  On April 25 2023 President Joe Biden announced his run for reelection keeping Vice President Kamala Harris as his running mate. 192 193 Consequently Republicans have intensified their criticism of Harris since Biden declared his intention to run for office. 194 During late 2021 as Biden was facing low approval ratings there was speculation that he would not seek reelection 195 and some prominent Democrats Representatives Carolyn Maloney Tim Ryan and former Representative Joe Cunningham publicly urged Biden not to run. 196 197 198 In addition to Bidens unpopularity many are concerned about his age he was the oldest person to assume the office at age 78 and would be 82 at the end of his first term. If reelected he would be 86 at the end of his second term. 199 According to an NBC poll released in April 2023 70 percent of Americans including 51 percent of Democrats believe Biden should not run for a second term. Almost half said it was because of his age. According to the FiveThirtyEight national polling average Bidens current approval rating is 41 percent while 55 percent disapprove. 200 There was also speculation that Biden may face a primary challenge from a member of the Democratic Partys progressive faction. 201 202 After Democrats outperformed expectations in the 2022 midterm elections many believed the chances that Biden would run for and win his partys nomination had increased. 203  Author Marianne Williamson announced her candidacy in February 2023 before Biden announced his own candidacy for reelection. Williamson had previously sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. 204 In April 2023 Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced his candidacy for the nomination. 205 Then on October 9 2023 Kennedy announced that he would be dropping out of the Democratic primary and would instead run as an independent candidate. 206 Representative Dean Phillips announced his run against Biden on October 26. 207  On March 6 2024 Philips suspended his campaign after failing to win any primaries the previous night on Super Tuesday. Biden Palmer and Williamson remain the only major candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination. 208  On March 12 2024 Biden officially became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee. 209   Donald Trump the thenincumbent president was defeated by Biden in the 2020 election and is not termlimited to run again in 2024 making him the fifth expresident to seek a second nonconsecutive term. If he wins Trump would be the second president to win a nonconsecutive term after Grover Cleveland in 1892. 210 Trump filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission FEC on November 15 2022 and announced his candidacy in a speech at MaraLago the same day. 211 212 Trump is considered an early frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination following his 2024 campaign announcement on November 15 2022. 213 Trump announced in March 2022 that if he runs for reelection and wins the Republican presidential nomination his former vice president Mike Pence will not be his running mate. 214  In March 2023 Trump was indicted over his hush money payments to adult film actress Stormy Daniels. 215 Trump was again indicted in June over his handling of classified documents which contained materials sensitive to national security. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all the charges related to these indictments. 216 217  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was seen as the main challenger to Trump for the Republican nomination he raised more campaign funds in the first half of 2022 and had more favorable polling numbers than Trump by the end of 2022. 218 219 220 On May 24 2023 DeSantis announced his candidacy on Twitter in an online conversation with Twitter CEO Elon Musk. American decline is not inevitable it is a choice...I am running for president of the United States to lead our great American comeback DeSantis added. His campaign stated to have raised 1 million in the first hour following the announcement of his candidacy. 221 Speaking on Fox Friends he stated that he would destroy leftism in the United States. 222 At the end of July 2023 FiveThirtyEights national polling average of the Republican primaries had Trump at 52 percent and DeSantis at 15. 223  Following the Iowa caucuses in which Trump posted a landslide victory DeSantis and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump leaving the former president and Nikki Haley the former South Carolina governor who served in Trumps cabinet as the only remaining major candidates. 224 225 Trump continued to win all four early voting contests while Haleys campaign struggled to gain momentum. 226 On March 6 2024 the day after winning only one primary out of fifteen on Super Tuesday Haley suspended her campaign. Trump became the only remaining major candidate for the Republican presidential nomination. 227  On March 12 2024 Trump officially became the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. 228   Thirdparty and independent candidates have also announced presidential runs. They include socialist activist and intellectual Cornel West who announced a campaign as an independent after initially announcing a run as a Peoples Party and later a Green Party candidate. 186 Centrist political organization No Labels intended to field a thirdparty unity ticket before abandoning their efforts in April 2024. 229 Some established third parties such as the American Solidarity Party the Prohibition Party and the Party for Socialism and Liberation have announced presidential nominees while others such as the Libertarian Party the Green Party and the Constitution Party have begun their primaries.

Trump has maintained a consistent lead in primary polling since 2020. Among nonTrump candidates DeSantis initially polled in a close second behind Trump 8 but his polling numbers steadily declined throughout 2023. 9 Ramaswamy experienced a polling surge in mid2023 but this surge proved to be brief. 10 11 Haleys campaign began picking up steam in the final months of 2023 though neither she nor any other candidate came close to Trump in polling. 12 The Republican primaries were referred to as a race for second due to Trumps consistent lead in polls. 13  At the January 15 Iowa caucuses Trump posted a landslide victory with DeSantis narrowly beating out Haley for second place and Ramaswamy in a distant fourth. 14 Following the Iowa caucuses Ramaswamy and DeSantis dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump leaving Trump and Haley as the only remaining major candidates. 15 16 Trump then defeated Haley in the January 23 New Hampshire primary albeit by a smaller margin of victory than he achieved in Iowa 17 he defeated Haley again in the February 24 South Carolina primary a month later. 18 After Trumps overwhelming victories nationwide on Super Tuesday Haley suspended her campaign on March 6 having only won Vermont and the District of Columbia. 19  Some Republicans have expressed concerns about Trumps candidacy due to his loss in 2020 his alleged role in inciting the January 6 United States Capitol attack his ongoing criminal indictments and the results of the 2022 midterms in which several Trumpendorsed candidates lost key races. 20 However many others have supported him and decried the investigations as politically motivated. 21 Trump maintains high favorability ratings among Republican voters. 22 Trumps eligibility to appear on the ballot was challenged by some voters and political leaders in Colorado Maine and Illinois 23 24 25 but these efforts were rejected by the Supreme Court of the United States in a unanimous decision. 26 Trump became the presumptive nominee on March 12 with his victory in the Washington primary bringing him over the 1215 delegate threshold needed to clinch the nomination. 27  As of April 2024 more than 400 candidates have filed with the Federal Election Commission FEC to run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024. 28  A week after the 2022 midterm elections former president Donald Trump announced at MaraLago that he would run again for the presidency in 2024. 91 Trump is the first former president to run for president after leaving office since Herbert Hoover did so in 1940. If he wins the Republican nomination he will be the first Republican to be nominated for president three separate times since Richard Nixon Republican nominee in 1960 1968 and 1972. 92 If elected Trump would become the only president other than Grover Cleveland to serve two nonconsecutive terms. 91  On February 14 former South Carolina governor and former U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley released a video announcing her presidential candidacy. 93  On February 21 businessman Vivek Ramaswamy announced his presidential candidacy on Tucker Carlson Tonight. 94  On March 2 businessman Perry Johnson who had been deemed ineligible to appear on the Republican primary ballot in the 2022 Michigan gubernatorial election due to allegedly fraudulent signatures announced his intent to run for president in 2024. 77  On April 2 former Arkansas governor Asa Hutchinson announced his candidacy during an interview with ABC News Jonathan Karl. 95 On April 6 Hutchinson filed candidate paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. 44  On April 12 Sen.

However Bellows stayed her own ruling pending the results of a challenge in court. 188 On February 28 a Cook County judge Tracie Porter ordered the removal of Trump from the ballot in Illinois also citing Section 3 of the 14th Amendment. 189 190  On March 4 2024 the Supreme Court of the United States issued a unanimous 9 0 ruling that the efforts by the Colorado Supreme Court under orders of the Colorado Attorney general to have Trump barred from the ballot were unconstitutional as that decision can only be made by the United States Congress and that Trump must be reinstated on the ballot. 26  The first Republican debate was held on August 23 2023 hosted by Fox News and moderated by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum. 191 To be eligible for the debate a candidate must have polled with at least 1 of voter support received donations from 40000 individuals and signed a loyalty pledge to back whoever ultimately wins the party presidential nomination. 121 Doug Burgum Chris Christie Ron DeSantis Nikki Haley Asa Hutchinson Mike Pence Vivek Ramaswamy and Tim Scott all qualified for the first debate. Donald Trump gave an interview with Tucker Carlson during the same time slot. 119  The second Republican debate was held on September 27 in Simi Valley California at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. The requirements were similar to the first debate but increased the number of individual donors required to 50000 and required the candidates to poll at or above three percent in two national polls or in one national poll and two early state polls. 192 Seven candidates were invited to the second debate Burgum Christie DeSantis Haley Pence Ramaswamy and Scott. 193  The third debate was held in Miami Florida on November 8. 194 The donor threshold for the third debate increases to 70000 unique donors including 200 donors in 20 or more states while the polling threshold increases to four percent in two national polls or four percent in one national poll and four percent in two statewide polls in Iowa New Hampshire Nevada or South Carolina. 195 Christie DeSantis Haley Ramaswamy and Scott qualified for the third debate. 196  A fourth debate was held in Tuscaloosa Alabama on December 6.

Totals raised include individual contributions loans from the candidate and transfers from other campaign committees. Individual contributions are itemized catalogued by the FEC when the total value of contributions by an individual comes to more than 200. The last column Cash On Hand shows the remaining cash each campaign had available for its future spending as of December 31 2023. Campaign finance reports for the first quarter of 2024 will become available on April 15 2024. 200  This table does not include contributions made to Super PACs or party committees supporting the candidate.

Republican Party rules mandate that changes to all contest dates must occur by September 2023 and there appears to be a trend of contests being scheduled earlier than usual. 1 They specify that all must occur between March and June 11 2024 except for Iowa New Hampshire Nevada and South Carolina which are allowed to hold contests in February. Iowa chose to hold its caucus the earliest in over a decade on a federal holiday January 15 as the rules are not legally binding. 220  After the 2020 presidential election the Democraticcontrolled Nevada Legislature moved to establish a presidential primary for the Republican and Democratic parties. 221 Previously partyorganized caucuses were used in Nevada to determine delegates in presidential elections. In May 2023 the Nevada Republican Party sued the state of Nevada in an effort to continue the use of caucuses as the means to determine its delegate allocation. The Nevada Attorney Generals office stated that the Nevada Republican Party was allowed to choose between a primary or caucus since the primary is nonbinding and because state law does not mandate specific rules governing how political parties are to choose its candidate for president. 222  On August 14 2023 the Nevada Republican Party announced it would hold its caucuses on February 8 while the February 6 state primary would not be binding. 223  The Michigan primaries were originally scheduled to be held in March in accordance with Republican Party rules. Democrats who were in control of the Michigan legislature and governorship after the 2022 midterm elections moved up both primaries as part of their own 2024 presidential delegate selection plan. As a result the earlier date of February 27 violates Republican rules which state that only Iowa New Hampshire Nevada and South Carolina can vote earlier than March 1 2024. citation needed  Republicans in Michigan have criticized Democrats in Michigan for their unilateral move. 224 Eventually the Republicans held a primary on February 27 and a caucus on March 2. There will be an estimated total of 2467 delegates to the 2024 Republican National Convention. In contests until March 15 delegates must be awarded on a proportional basis either by percentage of statewide vote or share of congressional districts won. Some states have established thresholds between 4 and 20 for proportionality to kick in under which a candidate receives no delegates. A vast majority 41 contests totaling 1920 delegates operate this way using methods that are hybrid between proportionality and majoritytakeall. New York for example has a 20 threshold for proportionality but if a candidate wins a majority they take all delegates. 225 226 better source needed  North Dakota Wyoming American Samoa Guam Virgin Islands and 51 of Pennsylvanias 67 delegates are unpledged free to vote for anyone at the convention totaling 119. Florida New Jersey Ohio Colorado Arizona Nebraska South Dakota and Montanas delegates are strictly awarded on a pluralitytakeall basis totaling 428. It will be possible for a candidate to take all 928 delegates of 19 contests by simply winning a threshold of votes. 225 226 better source needed  By Super Tuesday over 40 of delegates will have been awarded and most by March 19. Republican Party rules mandate changes to delegate allocation methods happen by September 30. The primaries will conclude with a final vote on the nominee by a majority of delegates at the newly elected Republican National Convention in Milwaukee which will be held July 15 18. 225 226 better source needed  According to the current rules of the Republican Party no candidate can have their name placed into nomination thereby earning television airtime at the Republican National Convention unless he or she has received a plurality of delegates in at least five states the rules state that state or states shall be taken to include American Samoa the District of Columbia Guam the Northern Mariana Islands Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. 1 227
