Its popularization marks a significant departure from conservatism and classical liberalism and has been considered radical by many as a result. 1 2 The position is often held by anarchocapitalists objectivists most minarchists anarchists rightwing libertarians and voluntaryists. Proponents of this position see taxation as a violation of the nonaggression principle. 3 Under this view government transgresses property rights by enforcing compulsory tax collection regardless of what the amount may be. 4 5 Some opponents of taxation like Michael Huemer argue that rightful ownership of property should be based on what he calls natural property rights not those determined by the law of the state. 6  Defenders of taxation argue that the notions of both legal private property rights and theft are defined by the legal framework of the state and thus taxation by the state does not represent a violation of property law unless the tax itself is illegal. 7 8 Some defenders of taxation such as socialist Matt Bruenig argue that the phrase taxation is theft is questionbegging since it relies on presupposing a particular theory of property entitlement. 9  In the 17th century John Locke took the position in Second Treatise of Government that government authority arises from the consent of the governed and not through the divine right of kings. 10 The libertarian activist L.

In it he stated that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract.

https://taxjustice.net/faq/is-taxation-theft/,  No taxation is not theft because you do not have a right to your pretax income in legal and moral terms. Many political arguments start from the assumption that taxation is the government taking our money off us. This feeling that your pretax income is your money is understandably difficult to shake. It s hard not to see the pretax figure on your payslip as representing what s really owing to you for the work you ve done and hence to feel that the state is taking away from you something that is yours by right.  However the fact that you are legally obliged to pay tax on your income and face fines and jail time if you don t means you clearly don t have a legal right to your pretax income. So if you do not have a legal right to your pretax income do you have a moral right. No because to suppose that each person has a moral right to their pretax income would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pretax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pretax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer.  Your pretax income isn t the money you deserve it is the money the amoral market has gifted you. A government may have cause to respect the whims of the market as a matter of practical necessity. But the state has no moral reason to respect the whims of the market. The only legitimate bar to redistribution is economic reality. Any politician who thinks it a good thing in and of itself to give people more of their money is confused.  Read the full blog here. The Tax Justice Network believes our tax and financial systems are our most powerful tools for creating a just society that gives equal weight to the needs of everyone.

Edited byNigel Warburton This assumption although almost universal is demonstrably confused. There is no serious political theory according to which my pretax income is mine in any morally significant sense. Moreover this matters this confused assumption is a major stumbling block to economic reform causes low and middle earners to vote against their economic interests and renders it practically impossible to correct the economic injustices that pervade the modern world. In addressing the question of whether taxation is theft it is important to distinguish two senses of theft legal and moral. In 18thcentury North America it was possible to own a slave in the legal sense of ownership. If someone deprived me of my slave in order to give that slave liberty then this constituted theft in the legal sense. But of course the laws underpinning slavery were morally abhorrent and hence few these days would class liberating a slave as theft in any moral sense. Conversely we can have cases of moral theft that are not legal theft. The laws of Nazi Germany enabled the authorities to seize the property of Jews who had been deported although strictly speaking legal such actions constituted theft in a moral sense. And so when we ask ourselves whether taxation is theft we have to specify whether we are thinking of the moral or legal sense or both. If we wanted to say that tax is legal theft then we would have to argue that people have a legal claim to their pretax income and hence that the government commits legal theft when it takes the pretax income of its citizens. This idea can be quickly dismissed. Clearly if Ms Jones is legally obliged to pay a certain amount of tax on her gross income then she is not legally entitled to keep all her pretax income. It follows logically that the state does not commit legal theft when it enforces the payment of this tax. The more interesting question is whether taxation is moral theft and this depends on whether citizens have some kind of moral claim on their gross income. It is to this question I now turn. Your gross or pretax income is the money the market delivers to you. In what sense might it be thought that you have a moral claim on this money? One answer might be that you deserve it you have worked hard and have done a good job and consequently you deserve all your gross income as recompense for your labour. According to this line of reasoning when the government taxes it takes the money that you deserve for the work you do. This is not a plausible view. For it implies that the market distributes to people exactly what they deserve for the work that they do. But nobody thinks a hedgefund manager deserves many times more wealth than a scientist working on a cure for cancer and few would think that current pay ratios in companies reflect what philosophers call desert claims. Probably you work very hard in your job and you make an important contribution. But then so do most people and the market distribution of wealth patently does not reward in proportion to how hardworking people are or how much of a contribution they make to society. If we were just focusing on desert then there is a good case for taxation to correct the amoral distribution of the market. If we have a moral claim on our gross income it is not because we deserve it but because we are entitled to it. What s the difference? What you deserve is what you ought to have as a result of hard work or social contribution what you are entitled to is the result of your property rights. Libertarians believe that each individual has natural property rights which it would be immoral for the government to infringe. According to Rightwing libertarians such as Robert Nozick and Murray Rothbard taxation is morally wrong not because the taxman takes what people deserve but because he takes what people have a right to. Therefore if taxation is theft it s because it essentially involves the violation of people s natural rights to property. But do we really have natural rights to property? And even if we do does taxation really infringe them? To begin to address these questions we need to think more carefully about the nature of property. A person has a moral claim on all her gross income only if property rights are natural not human constructions The French anarchist PierreJoseph Proudhon declared in 1840 that all property is theft. But even among those who accept the legitimacy of property there are very different views as to what exactly the right to property amounts to. Libertarians believe that property rights are natural reflecting basic moral facts about the world. Others hold that property rights are merely legal social constructions which are created by us and can be shaped to suit our purposes. We can call the latter view social constructivism about property. Please note our focus here is specifically on social constructivism about property we are not considering a more general position according to which morality as a whole is a social construction. To bring out the difference ask yourself Which comes first facts about property or facts about property law? For the social constructivist the right to property is not some natural sacred thing that exists independently of human conventions and legal practices. Rather we create property rights by setting up legal institutions to ensure that people have certain legal rights over the material world. For the libertarian in contrast facts about property exist independently of human laws and conventions and indeed human laws and conventions ought to be moulded to respect the natural right to property. This distinction is crucial for our question. Suppose we accept the socialconstructivist view that property rights are merely legal. Now we ask the question Do I have a moral claim on the entirety of my pretax income? We cannot argue that I am entitled to my pretax income on the basis of my natural property rights as there are no such things as natural property rights according to the socialconstructivist position we are now considering. So if I have a moral claim on my entire pretax income this must be because it is exactly the amount of money I deserve for my hard work and social contribution presumably because in general the market delivers to each person exactly what they deserve. But we have already concluded that this is not a plausible claim. Without the belief in natural property rights existing independent of human laws and conventions there is no way to make sense of the idea that the deliverances of the market are inherently just and hence no way to make sense of the idea that each person s gross income which is just the income the market delivers to them is hers by right. Here s where we re up to to make sense of the idea that taxation is moral theft we have to make sense of the idea that each person has a moral claim on the entirety of her gross income and this can be made sense of only if property rights are natural rather than mere human constructions. We need therefore to defend a theory of natural property rights. Our next task is to explore philosophical theories of property rights. We can group philosophical theories of property rights into three categories Rightwing libertarian Leftwing libertarian and social constructivist. Let s take each in turn. All libertarians hold that an individual has full natural rights of ownership over herself and the fruits of her labour. However libertarians of the Right and the Left disagree over the ownership rights that individuals can have over the natural world ie over land and natural resources. Rightwing libertarians believe that the material world all land and everything that stands on it was once owned by nobody. The first individuals who discover or claim or mix their labour a phrase introduced in this context by the 18thcentury philosopher John Locke with things in the natural world come to possess an inalienable natural property right over those things. If I m the first to find some land and I farm it I come to have natural property rights over that land such that it is morally wrong for someone to take the land or its produce away from me without my consent. We can now start to see how someone might try to make sense of the view that taxation is moral theft. If we think of the market as a free and consensual exchange among individuals of things over which they have natural property rights then any state interference with the market will constitute infringement of individuals natural rights. Taxation will take from citizens what is theirs by right. Less familiar in popular discourse is the view known as Leftwing libertarianism defended among others by Peter Vallentyne Hillel Steiner and Michael Otsuka. Leftwing libertarians agree with Rightwing libertarians that each individual has full rights of ownership over herself and the fruits of her labour. However they hold that the natural world belongs to everyone it is not possible for one individual to acquire exclusive rights over land or natural resources in a way that excludes the equal moral claims of other citizens. The claims of future generations must also be taken into account leading naturally to an inheritance tax There are various forms of this view. In a more extreme version the natural world is jointly owned by everyone such that no one is permitted to own anything without the express consent of every other living individual compare if we jointly own a house you can t just let out half of it without my consent. In a more modest form no one is allowed to acquire property unless they leave enough for each person to have an equally valuable share of natural resources. The uniting principle of Leftwing libertarians is that each of us has an equal moral claim over the resources of the world. Left libertarianism will certainly rule out some forms of taxation as immoral. If I have acquired land or natural resources in a way that is consistent with the equal moral claim of others and by my own labour increase the value of those resources it is wrong for the state to tax that wealth away from me. But Leftlibertarian theories leave considerable latitude for the state to alter the distribution of wealth perhaps through taxation if some take more than their fair share of natural resources. Crucially the claims of future generations must also be taken into account leading naturally to an inheritance tax or at least restrictions on the right to bequeath to ensure that each future individual has a fair share of natural resources. As already discussed social constructivists do not deny the existence of property rights rather they take them to be social or legal constructions which humans are free to shape to reflect what they deem valuable. Jesus declared that The Sabbath was made for man and not man for the Sabbath. Analogously for the social constructivist property rights are made to serve human interests and not vice versa. It is plausible that human flourishing requires certain legally protected rights to property and hence most social constructivists will advocate a system of property rights. At the same time there are other things of value perhaps equality perhaps reward for hard work andor social contribution which as we have seen is not wellprotected by the market and in order to promote these other values most social constructivists propose making property rights conditional on the payment of taxes. In the absence of preexisting natural property rights there is no moral reason to respect the market distribution of wealth there will of course be pragmatic economic reason but that is another matter. Almost all politicians and voters start from the assumption that each citizen has some kind of moral claim on her gross income. In fact we have seen that making sense of this requires some hefty and highly contentious philosophical theses. It requires accepting the general libertarian commitment to property being natural and not dependent on human laws or conventions. And it also requires denying the Leftwing libertarian claim that each of us has an equal moral claim on the resources of the natural world. The second requirement the denial of equal rights over the natural world is particularly implausible and something I ve never seen any justification of from Rightwing libertarians. On the Rightwing libertarian view it is perfectly morally acceptable for one person to claim a vastly unequal proportion of land and resources for himself resulting in his propertyless neighbours being forced to work for him to avoid starvation. By what right can the natural world be appropriated in this way? It is one thing to say that one has exclusive natural rights over oneself but how can we justify exclusive natural rights over the natural world? And if it can t justify this Rightwing libertarianism falls at the first hurdle. Moreover as I will now try to show even if Rightwing libertarianism is true even if there are natural property rights even if such rights allow private individuals to carve off for themselves a vastly unequal share of natural resources even then we cannot make sense of the idea that actual people living today have a moral claim on their pretax income. Professor Schmidt s salary comes from the state she has no right to complain that she keeps only some of this stolen money The reason is that the world that Rightwing libertarianism theorises about is a very different one to the world we live in today. It is no accident that Nozick s 1974 book is called Anarchy State and Utopia. According to Rightwing libertarianism the market distribution of wealth is morally significant because it is the distribution that respects the voluntary choices people have made with the property to which they have a natural right. But this is the case only if the market is perfectly free ie if the state has no influence on the distribution of wealth. Yet there are very few countries in the world in which this is the case. In almost every country there is a certain amount of taxation at least to pay for roads and infrastructure if not for education and healthcare. But even the smallest such state intervention entails that the market distribution of wealth no longer reflects the free choices of citizens and hence by the lights of Rightwing libertarianism the citizens of these countries have no moral claim on their pretax income. The point can be made clearer with some examples. Consider a Professor Schmidt a Rightwing libertarian academic working in a German university who is very annoyed about the state taking 42 per cent of her income. Where did her salary come from? Well German universities are publicly funded and so Schmidt s salary comes from general taxation from the money the German state forcibly extracted from its citizens. But according to Rightwing libertarianism this is an immoral state action that infringes the natural rights of its citizens in effect it steals from people to pay Professor Schmidt. It follows that Professor Schmidt has no right to her salary and hence no right to complain that the state lets her have only 58 per cent of this stolen money. Perhaps some radical libertarians will gleefully agree with me that professors who leech off the state have no right to resent taxation. But the point applies quite generally although in a more subtle way. Now consider a Ms Jones a libertarian British businesswoman who resents paying tax on dividends from her lucrative company. Although she is not directly paid by the state the profits generated by Jones s business are dependent on many things that are funded by the state perhaps she receives state subsidies but even if not certainly the success of her company will depend on infrastructure roads rule of law and an educated and healthy workforce. It doesn t matter whether in principle these things could have been provided privately in reality they are provided by the state and funded through taxation. According to Rightwing libertarianism these things were paid for by theft and hence Jones has no right to the profits thus generated. In theory Rightwing libertarianism does entail that people have a moral claim on their pretax income and hence that taxation is theft but only in hypothetical societies where there is zero or minimal state interference in the economy. In states in which the government intervenes in the economy through taxation ie in almost every developed state market transactions are tainted and so are morally void. The Rightwing libertarian is perfectly entitled to campaign for the day when her minimalgovernment Utopia is brought about but until that day she cannot consistently argue that she has a right to her pretax income and hence cannot consistently complain that the government is taking what is hers by right. It s hard to shake the feeling that the gross income figure on your payslip represents your money and that the difference from your takehome pay represents how much the state has taken from you. In fact there is no coherent way of justifying this conviction. Even if the most radical forms of Rightwing libertarianism are true it remains the case that you have no special moral claim on your gross income. Still the vast majority happily vote for low taxes rejoicing that they get to keep their morsel while in reality all they ve done is protect the spoils of a tiny minority at the top. The result is our failure to create what we really need a tax system that as part of the wider economy creates a just society. Americans have always borrowed but how exactly did their lives become so entangled with the power of plastic cards? Love is much more than a mere emotion or moral ideal. It imbues the world itself and we should learn to move with its power The term is ubiquitous and doubleedged. It is both a key source of authentic knowledge and a danger to true solidarity The lives of North Africans in France are shaped by a harrowing struggle to belong marked by postcolonial trauma For Margaret Macdonald philosophical theories are akin to stories meant to enlarge certain aspects of human life How a century ago radical freethinkers quietly and persistently subverted Scotland s Christian establishment
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_as_theft%23Response, The position that taxation is theft and therefore immoral is found in a number of political philosophies. Its popularization marks a significant departure from conservatism and classical liberalism and has been considered radical by many as a result. 1 2 The position is often held by anarchocapitalists objectivists most minarchists anarchists rightwing libertarians and voluntaryists. Proponents of this position see taxation as a violation of the nonaggression principle. 3 Under this view government transgresses property rights by enforcing compulsory tax collection regardless of what the amount may be. 4 5 Some opponents of taxation like Michael Huemer argue that rightful ownership of property should be based on what he calls natural property rights not those determined by the law of the state. 6  Defenders of taxation argue that the notions of both legal private property rights and theft are defined by the legal framework of the state and thus taxation by the state does not represent a violation of property law unless the tax itself is illegal. 7 8 Some defenders of taxation such as socialist Matt Bruenig argue that the phrase taxation is theft is questionbegging since it relies on presupposing a particular theory of property entitlement. 9  In the 17th century John Locke took the position in Second Treatise of Government that government authority arises from the consent of the governed and not through the divine right of kings. 10 The libertarian activist L. K. Samuels asserts in his Rulers Paradox that since the citizenry is the holder of all rights governmental bodies derive their authority to govern society via elections of government officials. In that vein Samuels maintains that citizens can only give rights which they have. The Rulers Paradox comes into play when governmental bodies exercise rights that the citizens do not hold or could not hold. According to Samuels If ordinary citizens could assassinate steal imprison torture kidnap and wiretap without incrimination that authority could be transferred to government for its democratic arsenal of policymaking weaponry. 11 Taxation could be viewed as theft since according to Lockean natural rights doctrine government authority must obtain their rights from the citizenry. 12  Lysander Spooner a 19thcentury lawyer and political philosopher who had argued before the United States Supreme Court wrote the essay No Treason The Constitution of No Authority. In it he stated that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. No open avowed or responsible association or body of men can say this to him because there is no such association or body of men in existence. If any one should assert that there is such an association let him prove if he can who compose it. Let him produce if he can any open written or other authentic contract signed or agreed to by these men forming themselves into an association making themselves known as such to the world appointing him as their agent and making themselves individually or as an association responsible for his acts done by their authority. Until all this can be shown no one can say that in any legitimate sense there is any such association or that he is their agent or that he ever gave his oath to them or ever pledged his faith to them. 13 14  The 19thcentury French economist Fr d ric Bastiat described taxes as legal plunder. Bastiat held that the states only legitimate function was to protect the life liberty and property of the individual. Now legal plunder may be exercised in an infinite multitude of ways. Hence come an infinite multitude of plans for organization tariffs protection perquisites gratuities encouragements progressive taxation free public education right to work right to profit right to wages right to assistance right to instruments of labor gratuity of credit etc. etc. And it is all these plans taken as a whole with what they have in common legal plunder that takes the name of socialism. 15  Murray Rothbard argued in The Ethics of Liberty in 1982 that taxation is theft and that tax resistance is therefore legitimate Just as no one is morally required to answer a robber truthfully when he asks if there are any valuables in ones house so no one can be morally required to answer truthfully similar questions asked by the state e.g. when filling out income tax returns. 16 17  Andrew Napolitano attempts to justify the position that taxation is theft in his book It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong where he asks a series of rhetorical questions like Is it theft if one man steals a car? and What if a gang of ten men take a vote allowing the victim to vote as well on whether to steal the car before stealing it? showing what he believes are similarities between theft and taxation. 18 nonprimary source needed  Liam Murphy and Thomas Nagel assert that since property rights are determined by laws and conventions of which the state forms an integral part taxation by the state cannot be considered theft. In their 2002 book The Myth of Ownership Taxes and Justice they argue ...the emphasis on distributing the tax burden relative to pretax income is a fundamental mistake. Taxation does not take from people what they already own. Property rights are the product of a set of laws and conventions of which the tax system forms a central part so the fairness of taxes can t be evaluated by their impact on preexisting entitlements. Pretax income has no independent moral significance. Standards of justice should be applied not to the distribution of tax burdens but to the operation and results of the entire framework of economic institutions. 7  Another justification of taxation is contained in social contract theory. Proponents argue that the public has democratically allowed people to accumulate wealth with the understanding that a portion of that wealth would be allocated for public use. In their view to accumulate wealth without taxation would be to violate this social understanding. 19 Institutions such as the IMF and economist Alex Cobham of the Tax Justice Network argue that since public services in the form of education and infrastructure provides a foundation for wealth creation a portion of those economic gains should therefore be used to continue to fund basic provisions that provide the opportunity for future economic growth. 20 The libertarian response to this is that they do not consent to the social contract and that any compact that would involuntarily bind people to it is tantamount to slavery. 21 Indeed John Locke himself argued that the social contract was a voluntary arrangement. 22 
https://wou.edu/westernhowl/taxation-not-theft/,  Home Opinion Taxation is not theft  Lake Larsen Digital Media Manager It s getting to be that time of the year again everyone s least favorite season tax season. As your W2s 1099Ts and all sorts of other forms with seemingly random letters and numbers come in the mail you might find yourself asking Why do I even need to pay taxes? After all you earned the money already now the government is going to take it from you? Some people are so adamant about keeping their money that they adopt the slogan of taxation is theft. But in reality this couldn t be further from the truth. The simple notion that taxing citizens is thievery from the government is commonly perpetuated by individuals who not only don t understand what taxes are but also what taxes pay for.  So what is a tax? In its simplest form a tax can be thought of as a fee you have to pay to the government. The most common form of taxes you ll see is income tax. Based on variables ranging from your filing status to how big the check is you ll have different amounts taken out. And these taxes pay for a large variety of things that are vital to the existence of a first world country. So now that you know what a tax is it s time to learn why taxes are actually a good thing. Do you enjoy driving on roads? How about going to a public school? Are you a fan of hospitals? All of these things in one way or another are paid for by federal and state tax dollars. The money that is taken from your check pays for the police officers and firefighters keeping you safe the teachers that helped you learn how to read and write and if you ever get down on your luck your tax dollars fund the social safety nets that will get you back on your feet. It s important to note that taxation isn t designed to break the bank. What you make in a year isn t the amount you get taxed on. If you have children or are married that lowers your tax burden. If you pay back some of your student loans or are forced to drive around a lot for work that also helps lower your taxable income. Moreover if you buy a hybrid car then that also helps lower your income. There are countless ways the government helps to lower the amount you have to pay. But at the end of the day it s still important that you pay the taxes you are asked. The most common argument about getting rid of taxes or implementing major tax cuts is the idea of privatizing sections of the government we pay taxes to. While this can lead to cheaper costs for consumers it doesn t always work. In the instance of space travel privatization has led to SpaceX being able to develop a rocket for fractions of the cost of what NASA has been able to do. However when the tax funded NASA sends rockets to space it s with the intent of conducting various experiments. Meanwhile privately funded SpaceX sends rockets to space with the intent of making a profit off cheaper rockets. However privatizing schools has resulted in charter schools that have some of the lowest literacy and mathematics levels in the country. On top of this there are some sectors that no business would ever want to make private like paving and maintaining roads for free for the use of everyone because there is no monetary incentive. Based off changes we ve already seen giving tax cuts in exchange for privatizing sectors of the government will only result in unhappy citizens with fractions of what used to be available to them.  Taxes are a vital and irreplaceable part of living in a first world country. They take money from all citizens and use it for the betterment of the country as a whole. Thinking that taxation is theft means you either don t fully comprehend what taxes are or you refuse to indorse the basis of what a first world country is. So instead of seeing the government as taking your money try to think of all the good your dollars do for everyone.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxation_as_theft%23References, The position that taxation is theft and therefore immoral is found in a number of political philosophies. Its popularization marks a significant departure from conservatism and classical liberalism and has been considered radical by many as a result. 1 2 The position is often held by anarchocapitalists objectivists most minarchists anarchists rightwing libertarians and voluntaryists. Proponents of this position see taxation as a violation of the nonaggression principle. 3 Under this view government transgresses property rights by enforcing compulsory tax collection regardless of what the amount may be. 4 5 Some opponents of taxation like Michael Huemer argue that rightful ownership of property should be based on what he calls natural property rights not those determined by the law of the state. 6  Defenders of taxation argue that the notions of both legal private property rights and theft are defined by the legal framework of the state and thus taxation by the state does not represent a violation of property law unless the tax itself is illegal. 7 8 Some defenders of taxation such as socialist Matt Bruenig argue that the phrase taxation is theft is questionbegging since it relies on presupposing a particular theory of property entitlement. 9  In the 17th century John Locke took the position in Second Treatise of Government that government authority arises from the consent of the governed and not through the divine right of kings. 10 The libertarian activist L. K. Samuels asserts in his Rulers Paradox that since the citizenry is the holder of all rights governmental bodies derive their authority to govern society via elections of government officials. In that vein Samuels maintains that citizens can only give rights which they have. The Rulers Paradox comes into play when governmental bodies exercise rights that the citizens do not hold or could not hold. According to Samuels If ordinary citizens could assassinate steal imprison torture kidnap and wiretap without incrimination that authority could be transferred to government for its democratic arsenal of policymaking weaponry. 11 Taxation could be viewed as theft since according to Lockean natural rights doctrine government authority must obtain their rights from the citizenry. 12  Lysander Spooner a 19thcentury lawyer and political philosopher who had argued before the United States Supreme Court wrote the essay No Treason The Constitution of No Authority. In it he stated that a supposed social contract cannot be used to justify governmental actions such as taxation because government will initiate force against anyone who does not wish to enter into such a contract. No open avowed or responsible association or body of men can say this to him because there is no such association or body of men in existence. If any one should assert that there is such an association let him prove if he can who compose it. Let him produce if he can any open written or other authentic contract signed or agreed to by these men forming themselves into an association making themselves known as such to the world appointing him as their agent and making themselves individually or as an association responsible for his acts done by their authority. Until all this can be shown no one can say that in any legitimate sense there is any such association or that he is their agent or that he ever gave his oath to them or ever pledged his faith to them. 13 14  The 19thcentury French economist Fr d ric Bastiat described taxes as legal plunder. Bastiat held that the states only legitimate function was to protect the life liberty and property of the individual. Now legal plunder may be exercised in an infinite multitude of ways. Hence come an infinite multitude of plans for organization tariffs protection perquisites gratuities encouragements progressive taxation free public education right to work right to profit right to wages right to assistance right to instruments of labor gratuity of credit etc. etc. And it is all these plans taken as a whole with what they have in common legal plunder that takes the name of socialism. 15  Murray Rothbard argued in The Ethics of Liberty in 1982 that taxation is theft and that tax resistance is therefore legitimate Just as no one is morally required to answer a robber truthfully when he asks if there are any valuables in ones house so no one can be morally required to answer truthfully similar questions asked by the state e.g. when filling out income tax returns. 16 17  Andrew Napolitano attempts to justify the position that taxation is theft in his book It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong where he asks a series of rhetorical questions like Is it theft if one man steals a car? and What if a gang of ten men take a vote allowing the victim to vote as well on whether to steal the car before stealing it? showing what he believes are similarities between theft and taxation. 18 nonprimary source needed  Liam Murphy and Thomas Nagel assert that since property rights are determined by laws and conventions of which the state forms an integral part taxation by the state cannot be considered theft. In their 2002 book The Myth of Ownership Taxes and Justice they argue ...the emphasis on distributing the tax burden relative to pretax income is a fundamental mistake. Taxation does not take from people what they already own. Property rights are the product of a set of laws and conventions of which the tax system forms a central part so the fairness of taxes can t be evaluated by their impact on preexisting entitlements. Pretax income has no independent moral significance. Standards of justice should be applied not to the distribution of tax burdens but to the operation and results of the entire framework of economic institutions. 7  Another justification of taxation is contained in social contract theory. Proponents argue that the public has democratically allowed people to accumulate wealth with the understanding that a portion of that wealth would be allocated for public use. In their view to accumulate wealth without taxation would be to violate this social understanding. 19 Institutions such as the IMF and economist Alex Cobham of the Tax Justice Network argue that since public services in the form of education and infrastructure provides a foundation for wealth creation a portion of those economic gains should therefore be used to continue to fund basic provisions that provide the opportunity for future economic growth. 20 The libertarian response to this is that they do not consent to the social contract and that any compact that would involuntarily bind people to it is tantamount to slavery. 21 Indeed John Locke himself argued that the social contract was a voluntary arrangement. 22 
https://mises.org/mises-wire/yes-taxation-theft, An influential book by Liam Murphy and Thomas Nagel The Myth of Ownership tries to show that this view of taxation is wrong. Many people they say foolishly resent taxes. By what right does the government take away part of what we own? Isn t this legalized theft? The government may claim that it needs the funds to provide essential social services are the poor to be left to starve? But these assertions do not justify its policy of forcible seizure. Isn t it up to each owner of property to decide what if anything he wishes to donate to charity and other good causes? You might guess that the authors will respond along conventional leftist lines with a denial that property rights are absolute you do not have the right to keep all that you own if the government s exactions are devoted to a good purpose. Quite the contrary they adopt a much more radical stance. You are not giving away anything at all to the government when you pay taxes since you own only what the laws say you do. Our authors are nothing if not direct on this point If there is a dominant theme that runs through our discussion it is this Private property is a legal convention defined in part by the tax system therefore the tax system cannot be evaluated by looking at its impact on private property conceived as something that has independent existence and validity. Taxes must be evaluated as part of the overall system of property rights that they help to create. . . . The conventional nature of property rights is both perfectly obvious and remarkably easy to forget . . . We cannot start by taking as given . . . some initial allocation of possessions what people own what is theirs prior to government interference. An example quickly discloses the authors fallacy. Suppose that the government banned advocacy of libertarian property rights. Against those who claimed that this interfered with free speech advocates of the new measure replied in this way Don t you see the obvious conceptual error that underlies your protest? Free speech is a legal category. People have no independent liberty of speech apart from what a particular legal system grants them. Your opposition is absurd away with you! I doubt that Murphy and Nagel would display much patience for this sophistry. Legal rights indeed depend on the specifications of a particular legal system but it is perfectly in order to say that people have moral rights not created by the legal system that the law ought to respect. In like fashion opponents of taxation are guiltless of the conceptual error Murphy and Nagel impute to them. They maintain that people possess property rights that the government ought to recognize. Why is the falsity of this view perfectly obvious? It is rather Murphy and Nagel who have lapsed into grievous error they confuse legal with moral rights. The authors at one place acknowledge the point at issue Deontological theories hold that property rights are in part determined by our individual sovereignty over ourselves. . . . On a deontological approach there is likely to be a presumption of some form of natural entitlement that determines what is yours or mine and what isn t and this prima facie presumption has to be overridden by other considerations if appropriation by taxes is to be justified. On a consequentialist approach by contrast the tax system is simply part of the design of any sophisticated modern system of property rights. Our authors of course reject the entitlement view but they have here made a crucial admission. Given that this theory exists is it not evident that their earlier account is false? The alleged error that opponents of taxation commit is present only if the conventionalist theory is true. Supporters of Lockean entitlements to property may be incorrect but they at least have a theory they stand acquitted of simply failing to grasp a conceptual point the charge that Murphy and Nagel bring against them. Do they think the Lockean account obviously incoherent? They say nothing against it but instead go on interminably to accuse opponents of their view of confusion. The conventionalist theory they support leads quickly to disaster. Isn t it perfectly obvious that it makes us all slaves of the government? Once more Murphy and Nagel acknowledge the objection. Their view is likely to arouse strong resistance because it sounds too much like the claim that the entire social product really belongs to the government and that all aftertax income should be seen as a kind of dole that each of us receives from the government if it chooses to look on us with favor They fail to see that their admission gives away the game. If as they admit individual rights require some degree of private property then the government cannot morally tax away this property. If so there are moral limits to the taxing power and it is not a matter of logic that there cannot be a pretax income over which persons retain full control Murphy and Nagel are pure conventionalists about property when this enables them to attack libertarians but they shrink from the full implications of the position. How is this tension in their presentation to be resolved? I suspect that in practice they would not deviate very far from the total subordination of property rights to the state. They consider endowment taxation in which people are taxed not just on their income but rather on their potential to generate revenue. Someone who abandoned a multimilliondollar business career in order to become a Trappist monk might on the endowment account be taxed as if he continued to receive his former high income. Our authors eventually reject this monstrous proposal though not on the grounds that it compels people to work. To reject the proposal because it compelled people to work would put them suspiciously close to a famous argument advanced very effectively by Robert Nozick that income taxes are akin to forced labor. Of course our authors cannot accept so libertarian a view we may assume that this argument is not dispositive against taxation of earnings. Since taxation is acceptable this we know a priori no argument that holds it illegitimate is right. But then we cannot reject endowment taxation if we reason in a way that would also condemn the income tax. There is no intrinsic moral objection to taxing people who don t earn wages p. 124. We can then maintain that endowment taxation is too radical an interference with autonomy but we cannot in principle reject it. If you affirm a conventionalist account of property you will wind up in dark waters. Taxation is indeed theft.  Note The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.

https://taxjustice.net/2014/10/08/money-taxation-isnt-theft/, Blogethicsjusticephilosophy A guest blog by Philip Goff. Many political arguments start from the assumption that taxation is the government taking our money off us. When austerity hit the arts in 2011 Dr Steve Davies of the pseudothinktank the Institute of Economic Affairs argued on Channel Four news TJN a mainstream UK television current affairs programme that the 20 cuts to the arts didn t go far enough art funding should be entirely abolished on the grounds that it s unfair to take people s money off them by force to pay for something they may not want. Again and again the economic right stoke resentment at the state allegedly taking what s ours by force and use this resentment to build support for a programme of small government. But even those who believe in relatively big government tend to share this understanding of taxation as the appropriation by government of our money . Most on the economic left start from the assumption that it is all things being equal a bad thing that the state takes our money from us but hold that this prima facie bad is justified by the public goods which taxation makes possible. Wellmeaning UK public intellectual Alain de Botton encourages us to think of taxation as charity we give up what s ours for the greater good of our society. So both sides tend to agree that one has some kind of right or entitlement to one s pretax income. The economic right believe that the right to pretax income is inalienable or at least that it is trumped only by the absolute necessity of providing the basic requirements of society such as roads and rule of law. In contrast the economic left tend to value the good of making society more equal or of providing a basic standard of living for all above the good of letting people keep their own money. This feeling that your pretax income is your money is difficult to shake. It s hard not to see the pretax figure on your payslip as representing what s really owing to you for the work you ve done and hence to feel that the state is taking away from you something that is yours by right. However a little careful reflection shows this almost universal assumption to be utterly confused. There is no sense in which you have a right to your pretax income. To see this we have to ask what kind of right it might be supposed one has to one s pretax income. Presumably it is either a legal right or a moral right. Once we separate out these alternatives we can see that the former option is incoherent whilst the latter is utterly implausible. You clearly don t have a legal right to your pretax income as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it. This is a simple analytic truth that follows from the definition of taxation. People who don t take pay their taxes go or at least legally ought to go to gaol. So if there is a general right to one s pretax income then it must be a moral right. But it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pretax income for that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pretax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pretax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer. This is just an accident of the way our market economy is structured. To hold that each person has a moral right to their pretax income would be to hold that the market economy just happens to deliver to each person exactly what they deserve and this is clearly not the case. Perhaps there are specific cases in which a person happens to deserve their pretax income these would be rare and happy coincidences in which the market happens to deliver exactly what is deserved. But the mere fact that your pretax income is X does not entail that in any morally significant sense you are entitled to X. The money the market happens to throw at you is not necessarily the money you deserve. No doubt you have worked hard for that money no doubt you have made a contribution to the public good you have special talents that others lack etc. But others also work hardare talentedmake a contribution and the market has not taken these morally significant factors into consideration in working out what to give to whom. For better or worse it s almost certainly not fair that you have what you have relative to what others have got. It s the responsibility of law makers then not to respect pretax incomes but to disrespect pretax incomes. Insofar as the market fails to yield a just distribution of incomes the state should work to correct that distribution. Of course to some degree the scope for such correction will be limited by economic realities. The pragmatic argument between right and left as to the relationship between tax levels and incentives to work or invest is a perfectly sensible one. But it is crucial to distinguish the pragmatic argument of the economic right We must lower taxes in order to encourage investment from the moral argument of the economic right We must lower taxes in order to give people more of their money . The former argument is based on an empirical claim which stands or falls with the data. The latter argument is based on the wholly confused notion that there is something morally significant about the distribution of incomes the market happens to have thrown up. Your pretax income isn t the money you deserve it is the money the amoral market has gifted you. A government may have cause to respect the whims of the market as a matter of practical necessity. But the state has no moral reason to respect the whims of the market. The only legitimate bar to redistribution is economic reality. Any politician who thinks it a good thing in and of itself to give people more of their money is confused. A similar argument is made at length in The Myth of Ownership by Murphy and Nagel published by Oxford University Press. See more on this topic in Tax Justice Focus 2010. Philip Goff is Associate Professor of Philosophy at the Central European University. He has research interests in consciousness the ethics of taxation and fictionalist interpretations of religious practice. He writes at Conscience and Consciousness. Also see www.philipgoffphilosophy.com and is philip_goff on Twitter. Completely inaccurate and something only an academic could have written. I m going to ignore the first point about the law as it s all but circular. Of course if the law states you must pay x amount of tax above y threshold you re legally obliged to pay it. The second point is far more interesting the morality of income. You write There is no justice in the fact that the pretax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pretax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer. This is just an accident of the way our market economy is structured. sic Of course there is. People are paid in proportion to how much revenue they generate something that leftistsacademics will never understand the later because they generate no revenue and produce nothing of real economic value and must be paid out of taxation. A banker who is paid 1myear is WORTH 1myear because he brings in many times more than that to his organisation. It is not an accident of the way our economy is structured that people are paid based on the revenue they generate. It s simple common sense and entirely natural. If you want to see what high levels of redistribution do for an economy plot a graph of government spending as a proportion of GDP vs GDP per capita for any countries you like. You will find that the more redistribution the lower the GDP per capita. This shouldn t even need explaining after the Soviet Union led to the collapse of half the world s economies and the greatest mass murders of the twentieth century but there we are. I guess it s easy to argue for redistribution when you re the one dependant on it. The argument that a person generates or makes any amount of money is in general a complete fallacy since it makes to believe that all persons are direct labour. In modern organisations the enourmous majority of people working are indirect labour they contribute to the structure that is productive but their individual contribution cannot be isolated from that of their colleagues. Even a banker does not signlehandedly generate X MEUR to its bank she is supported by a whole infraxtructure among which the very name reputation of the bank which allows homher to be effective. What the respective contributions of the person and of the structure is is anybody s guess.  In a voluntary exchange once each side has delivered and received the agreed contribution the parties are quits. Seeking to credit and debit them for putative outstanding claims is double counting. httpwww.econlib.orglibraryColumnsJasaydog.html While it may be difficult to quantify marginal productivity is real. The persons in the best position to evaluate what a good or service is worth are those actually buying it. The ONLY way to find out what anything is worth is to see what people will pay for it on the free market. To speak of how much a laborer should earn is as meaningless as to speak of absolute velocity through the luminiferous aether. The only standard of economic value is what people will freely choose to pay for something. So to speak of what people deserve to earn is utterly nonsensical. There is no other valid standard economic value against which to compare the outcome of a free market and call it unjust. I am forced to pay an extortionate amount for my household water for example because the private water company has a complete monopoly on supply and can extort economic rents on that supply. The same applies to my power supply to my telephone bill and to many goods and services I buy on a daily basis. The idea that there is perfect competition across all markets quite simply doesn t reflect everyday realities. Where monopolies exist buyers have no choice other than to pay high prices that monopolists can extract and since many markets are now monopilistic or oligopolistic in structure think search engines online retailers etc the notion that people freely choose to pay a market price is utterly unreal. When I freely chose to pay the water company what I think the price should be they threatened to cut me off. There is no other supplier. Where s the free partr of this market? You ve got to dig in further here. You stopped at the superficial level. Why does this water monopoly exist in your area? Surely if a private company is not fairly treating its customers it could never stay in business correct? They would just go elsewhere and there would be room for a new company with better business ethics to take hold. The answer 99 of the time is due to government collusion within the marketplace and legal system which has become something which can be used nefariously by those with enough money andor influence. In a true free market you would have no monopoly that wasn t held by a company which provided the highest quality goods and services at the lowest possible prices. Our issue today is that we do not have a true free market. We are burdened by crony capitalism and government regulation. Don t take my word for it though. Do your own research. Take a deep look into why that is the only water company in your area and why exactly they seemingly have this monopoly when apparently they are greatly overcharging their customers. What is and what ought should be treated as separate. I believe you confuse the two. Taxation is theft. Would it be theft if the mob would come up to my doorstep put a gun to my head and tell me to pay an x amount? Even if I oblige it is still theft. Why does it make a difference if the mob is called government? If i don t oblige I get thrown in a cage. Is this not a contradiction?  amoral market Hail King Caesar Philip. It s sad a philosophy professor calls something amoral when the fundamental basis of a market is mutual beneficial exchange. What s amoral about that? It s also sad a philosophy professor fails to see the amorality of a system that is based on force and coercion. First off you have to differentiate between monopolies and monopoly pricing because they re two different things that don t necessarily go hand in hand. A monopoly 100 market share can naturally remain only as long as it does not engage in monopoly pricing cutting production in order to artificially skew the supplydemand equilibrium towards higher prices because the latter invites an endless stream of price competition that can only be kept at bay though government protection. Thus a free market cannot endlessly support enterprises engaged in monopoly pricing. Every monopoly you can point out does one of two things 1 offers an utterly unbeatable product or service relative to its cost or 2 is protected by government. The first option is not harmful to consumers the latter is. Rain water is quite free and depending on your geographical location quite abundant. There are ways to both collect and use that free natural resource which you have no choice but to buy. It s certainly much easier to use the city s water utilities the piping and meter structure that they ve installed but you have a choice. However in some places there are many restrictions and ordinances that may limit the collection of rain water maybe even some that prohibit the practice. You can move to a place that doesn t. There s always a choice. Don t base your agreement with the original author of this post on so called monopolies . The only instance in which there IS NOT a clear choice is in taxation. Sure you could choose not to work I guess but how you gonna live? Gonna be a bum? That life isn t for everyone so for those of us that choose to work taxes are theft. Providers of one service or another may saturate an area but you re not forced at gunpoint to use those services in general. You can choose to have a phone. Maybe not necessarily with whom you get your service but you can choose to have it in the first place. You can choose to have internet or television service. Again possibly not where but you have the choice not to. Monopolies do exist in the manner in which you describe but monopolies DO NOT exist in choice toor not to partake. Taxes are forced on any workingincome receiving human being and it is theft. The free part of this market is in your choice to buypartake at all. When someone can legally place a gun to your head and force you to buy something universally across the board the free market will then have ceased to exist and only then. Many people realize this which is why there s been a massive increase in off the grid lifestyles. Nobody really believes they are truly off the grid but they ve chosen not to be a part of the systems that you ve mentioned for the basic reasons that you ve referenced but they had a choice. They made it. You re not forced to buy a service. However you are forced to pay the price the provider feels it s worth if you want the convenience of it. That s free market. The consumer group eventually determines the price an entity charges. If the consumer group will continue to pay they ll continue to charge. If the consumer group begins to back away from choosing a service in a monopolized region they will be forced to decrease prices in order to bring back more consumers or go bust. Except water isn t privatized sherlock. And you are confusing a forced monopoly with a natural monopoly that comes through free market competition. Only the government through coercion can force a monopoly onto you. Businesses can t. What you just described are utilities. You can t have 5 different power lines coming to your house. You can t have 5 coaxial cables being sourced from the pole outside same with telephone. This isn t a symptom of the free market. It s the free market being handcuffed. You re right it s not free at all. A free market would ve eliminated fees for other water companies to start up and compete with a better price which is why they would generate profit and overthrow monopoly based on their public demand of cheaper prices. When the state throws in these laws to eliminate competition there is nothing form stopping monopolies from emerging and extorting prices Some of these extorted prices go back to the state in return for additional laws to secure monopoly. Corrupt monopolies cannot exist privately when there is no stature to bait them into cronyism. Leiska that is so utterly naive to believe only those two scenarios of monopolies exist. Once a monopoly has a large enough grip they can use that economy of scale and capital to charge MUCH higher than should be possible to make profit yet low enough to prevent anyone from competing with massive startup and infrastructure costs. In addition with their huge capital built up the can eisasly undercut anyone who DOES have a large enough investment to be a threat in the short run drive them out of buisness and continue with the price fix. This also completely discourages future attempts. You could always dig your own well so you don t have to pay the water company for water. People are paid based on how valuable their labor is to the one who pays it which is why those with a BA in XXXXstudies tend to make next to nothing and surgeons and pop stars are well compensated the labor of the latter is more valued and hence people are willing to pay more for it. My older brother makes about the same as a roofing contractor as I do as a PhD health economist because our labor is similarly valued by those needing our services while professors of philosophy tend to be paid less than Us to which I can attest for my first academic position after defending I was offered what a humanities or philosophy professor was paid and offer raised by 50 when I pointed out that I already had two offers in hand for the higher amount. It was a cause of dissent afterwards that an Assistant Professor was making as much as older tenured faculty. In general those who are complaining that others are overpaid are generally just jealous because the pay differential points out that their own labor and skills are not as valuable as those of the higher paid person ..and they try to hide their jealously behind discredited pseudoMarxist claptrap. Nope. A lot of banking involves wealth extraction not wealth creation. Via risktaking to bailouts etc etc etc. So bringing in money isn t the same as creating wealth from a country s perspective. He is not worth that much money except on the narrow perspective of the bank itself. And you will find if you actually do the research that the hightax countries grow just as fast as the lowtax ones only without the penalties of high inequality crime etc. Exactly. In fact the simplest way to quickly bring in a lot of money is through devastation of resources. And that means destroying not creating wealth. Devastation of resources? You mean using resources? If a tree is cut and built into a boat is value wealth created or devastated ? Obviously value and thus wealth is created by the boatmaker. Thomas Sowell would argue that resources aren t equivalent to wealth. It is the utilisation of these resources that generates wealth. He has mentioned that academics often get this point wrong they think that wealth exists somewhere out there in the world no that s wrong. Wealth is created by interacting with the somewhere out there .  A lot of banking involves wealth extraction not wealth creation. Via risktaking to bailouts etc etc etc.  Are you referring to the central banking system? What does that have to do with the claim that taxation isn t theft.  The point I got out of the blog is that it s not theft because of what people deserve . This doesn t make sense to me.Maybe I believe jazz musicians deserve to make more than pop musicians. Does that make it okay for me to coerce pop stars into giving away their money?The only moral judgement in question here is whether coercion is okay not what random people believe others deserve. That s completely confused answer. Current economic value has nothing to do with social value or even economic value in the long run. That s the whole point. Completely useless as of now mathematical theory might well facilitate whole branch of economy in the future. Cure for cancer is socially worth infinitely more than current economic value generated by some banker if heshe generates value at all heshe may well be busy creating new economic crisis. There is a big difference between wages and income. Wages are a reward for labor done. Your labor is defined as property the most sacred kind of property there is. These are unalienable rights. They cannot be taken away from you by anyone. Wages can not be taxed. Income which belongs to the state can. Learn the difference. 1883 Butchers union v Cresent city co. 111 U.S. 746 to mention just one of hundreds of cases.There are many cases that can be looked up which tell you that tax is by consent only. Too many people are being brain washed watching the Kardashians on tv to even begin questioning what is happening. Turn your TV off and start learning. Exactly and therein lies the theft. Why in all that is holy would my income be treated any differently than my wages ? My income is money I earned it is mine and mine alone. What anyone chooses to do with their income should be purely their decision. Just because you think you know better than them what they need to do with their money does not give you the right to take it even under the guise of a tax which some state declared via some court decision was their right. Just because something is law or because something was decided in court does not in any way make it right. But he doesn t actually work for his money so in my opinion it doesn t count. I work with my hands I make things work fix things plant trees I earn my money. Don t have any respect for somebody who sits in an office and keeps getting richer off already being rich. If I cut someone s grass for 20 dollars why is someone else more entitled to some of that money than me? how did you get to their house to cut their grass? on a road? who paid to lay the tarmac? did any bandits rob you on the way? No? Who paid for the police to stop that kind of stuff? someone s got to pay for those things. If not the economic operators then who? Martians? but at no point did anyone agree to pay for those. If i didn t ask for your service i should not be required to pay you. i could have walked on a dirt path and brought a weapon to fight my own battles. Yes kind of like if someone cuts your grass without your consent then by no means are you obligated to pay them. Many housing estates have the road built buy the developer as noone would buy the house otherwise.Future repairs may be the responsibility of the estate s occupiersowners. What about road linking two communities?Eithera the communities could agree to fund a road linkb a toll road could be built As for police some communities have private security to enforce its rules.Of course the discussion can continue along the lines of what are the rules laws and whose rules apply to which community . But by and large humans have arrived at a set of universal laws intended to protect people and property acknowledging some cultural religious exceptions Clearly the first community above have to decide how many security guards they employ. Maybe one is enough. But the seocnd community may be made up of a lot of liberals who want to make lots of rules around behaviour and speech. Almost inevitably more rules require more police to enforce them so more cost. Let s have some choice so people can decide which sort of community they want to live in. So taxation is still theft . but I am quite willing to consider a service charge for MY small community as long as there isn t some monopolistic overbearing entity telling me what services my community must have. But liberals find it very hard not to tell others how they should think and behave .!  so er how would the rules INSIDE your community work and who pays for what?  Stupid question but I ll answer it for you anyway. Let s take a small town to make it easier for you. Let s say 50 adults and no children live in a rural town. They have a town meeting with 100 turnout and decide that the main road needs an upgrade. They have 2 choices upgrade it themselves using their own resources time and effort or hire a company to do it for them. They opt to hire a company and agree to divide the cost evenly amongst all 50 of them. Now let s say instead of all 50 agreeing there were 2 holdouts who didn t want to pay and instead wanted to do the work themselves. Should they be forced to pay or prohibited from using the road? It would be up to the town to decide. And that s the point. All arguments in favour of taxation presume that people must be dependant on a governing body to provide all their needs. We don t need to centralise anything. That s communism and it doesn t work and never has. If history has taught us anything it s that government is terrible at everything. Unshackle the free market and the common citizen and you won t need to worry about who s going to maintain the roads or provide security. Moreover you won t be forever complaining about funds not going where they re supposed to and that pothole never being fixed. Because when communities have their hands and their wallets untied they ll get that damn pothole fixed and properly this time! If the company your town hires to maintain the local roads doesn t do a good job you hire someone else. If you leave it all up to the government you have to write to your local member and hope they address it. If they don t vote someone else in and hope they do something etc. etc. What a joke! If tax is not theft then why are we forced to pay it under threat of imprisonment if you don t pay it. There are two types of wealth. One that is privately created and one that is commonly createdthat is the rental value of land. Unfortunately we socialise private wealth because commonly created wealth is privatised. Quite simply only the wealth we create together should pay for the services we share together. Because this is the only morally correct way of raising revenues is is also the only one which does not penalise work or enterprise. An annual fee for exclusive rights to use land directly relates to the benefit the payer receives and is noncoercive insofar as the payer chooses where to live and do business. The opposite of taxes on income and capital. Which are morally if not legally on a par with theft. Pay for what you use not be penalised for what you produce is how a just and civilised society should organise its affairs. Taxes are theft its either pay or go to jail now you explain to everyone how that is not theft So paying for goods at a supermarket is theft of your money by the supermarket? Taxes pay for roads courts schools etc. Taxes are payment for services received. Tax 101. Do you need police fire or teachers every day? You as in you the individual. No and no and no to all one the police never come their not intrested unless the can capture you doing 31 in a 30 zone and tax you again. Fire well let s face it there over paid and do nothing most of the time. And as for teachers well again those that work for state schools are a complete waste of space most schools now are academies now and a large proportion of their income comes from Coporate sponsors! More privatisation of once public services yet are taxes keep going up???? Wonder why that is! well the roads that are being built or that are built i had no say if i wanted that road or not or if i will ever even use that road. also if they are going to use my money can i come back and demand a refund if i don t like it within 60 days or whatever my return time is on said road? As for the supermarket no the supermarket is not in the wrong however the entity that is imposing the tax is.  Go and live on a small island somewhere. that s the choice. False dichotomy and you are a philosophy professor. The roads suck the public schools are a nightmare and the courts espouse positive law. So much for taxation. Roads are paid for by the gas tax. Schools are paid for by property tax. You voluntarily choose to pay that tax by purchasing gas or buying property. Income tax is not voluntary and is theft. The grocery store doesn t make you shop at their location under threat of prison. As for your ridiculous statement well don t consume the taxfunded public services then yeah I ll do that when they stop taxing me you knucklehead. Let me say this though. I am paying money so that roads on the other side of my country can be built that i will never use same for hospitals etc I am being taxed on a property that does not generate any revenue. If i have a house i have to pay every year a tax on that property the money for that tax comes from my wage and income as my house is not generating money so i have to use money that were already taxed on income to pay for other taxes that is absolutely wrong.I have to pay centralized taxes that serve all the country whereas a local system would be preferable. I pay tax that tax goes to my local city and is used for my city why should i pay the same amount of tax in the countryside as someone living in L.A when the money invested in countryside is miserable compared to L.A? Who is getting the most out of that money? Me or the person living in L.A? Yet we are still paying the same amount of tax. Government tax is also a monopoly i don t have the choice to not work and live in the woods hunting and catching fish as all those are government owned i am not allowed to hunt without a license not allowed to fish nor camp in the woods so i am born in this world and i don t have another choice other than working and paying tax i am being forced because what i want to do with my life is irrelevant and i will go to jail if i don t comply with what i m expected to do that is coercion and is illegal by definition.I m not saying that modern civilizations are sustainable without some form of contribution for the greater good but the way the system is built today is outrageous tax as it s intended today is theft.Also a few things about the article you backed your statement that tax is not theft with your own statement tax is not theft by the government because tax is mandatory by law and you have to pay it . That is not an argument you did not provide anything to disprove the idea that tax is theft other than just writing down the definition of why we are required to pay taxwhich makes it theft. Second you speak about morality and the discrepancy between wages of different professions however you state also that since the market is unfair there is no reason it should be fair on the tax part so if the market is unfair there is no reason to try and make it fair or request that you are given what is yours because hey the world is not fair and not everyone gets what they deserve so even if you might deserve the pretax money who cares but that is the opposite of how logical thinking should be. Just because a system is wrong doesn t mean we can simply close our eyes and ignores all the injustice people face and not do anything about it. And not to speak about collusion and corruption in the government stolen tax money and all kinds of stuff that make us who pay the taxes the least likely ones to get any benefit from them and those who find ways to escape the system the ones that benefit the most from them. Right. Taxation clearly is not theft because if a person does not pay taxes that person does or ought to go to jail. A mugger taking a person s wallet clearly isn t theft because if the wallet is not surrendered then the person should or ought to be stuck through with a shiv. What nonsense. Market value is determined by human values what individuals think is good to such a degree that they will surrender other good opportunities for it. It is a fair and efficient moral mechanism based on the moral character of the purchasers. Sure private people as well as governments will make destructive decisions but private people know their own needs better and demand more value for their money than a government could. We may worry validly say about plastic bags polluting commons such as water in an unregulated environment. Too many people overvalue the temporary convenience it is a moral problem sure. But ultimately I am more worried about taxfunded government shrapnel polluting the bodies of middleeasterners as our governments conduct multibillion dollar aerial wars in order to control the sources of oil so that moral taxsubsidized corporations can make those plastic bags so cheaply. And indeed that is also only possible because we pay them. Perhaps we should say not only that taxation is theft but that paying taxes is a warcrime. Yup. My point exactly because most of this information goes off in it little tax narrative without a balance of scales ..you know .that little thing called choice?Consentual willful of sound mind and without coersive influences like fear of being kidknapped and held against your will for a victimless state presumptive crime. Bang on Benjiiiii put the money we have earned though our own endeavours and hard work back into our pockets rather than being penalised for any success we have achieved. Becoming a taxpayer is entirely VOLUNTARY. But I didn t enter in that contract fully informed. Your public servants do not want you to know that they need my CONSENT to take your money.No consent no contract TheftActs statutes and legislations only apply to PERSONS and cooperate government employeesDid I claim to be a British Citizen? NO  hmmm interesting opinions. None of this is true of course. That depends did you fill out a government form and check a box that said Are you a British citizen?  The writer is basing his whole argument on pretax income which of course is circular logic and completely ignores the fact that income tax is not the only type of tax. I love how there s absolutely zero definition of this socalled amoral economy. You know the very thing his entire argument rests upon. If you don t understand economics people go down very bizarre and dark roads in order to justify their violent tendencies. To pretend that government is some kind of benevolent referee immune from attempts at personal gain and influence is pure fantasy. Economy is amoral doesn t have morality by definition. It s a mindless process. Are you able to justify paying some popstar without talent but popular for stupid reasons million of dollars and at the same time letting some mentally disabled person die? Yet that s exactly what would happen if you had your fantasy world pure freemarket economy. Here is the thing you and many others simply don t get. The whole idea of selfregulating economy is based on the myth that consumers a act rationally b have absolute knowledge c are mindful of other people wellbeing including future generations. It s utter nonsense. Moreover the argument that what you earn in such an economy is what you deserve is circular it begs the question. You don t pay a pop star without talent their record label does. And they can only do it because there are people that listen to their music. And if you want to help a mentally disabled person do it. But you can t force other people to do so. And the idea of a government regulated economy is based on the myth that a small group of people know the best way to use other people s money which is wrong. Exactly. And not only that but the myth that we all need all the things that our taxes supposedly pay for. So they not only claim to know how we should spend our money but also how we should go about living our life! How about getting us our money back and letting us figure it out for ourselves? I d be willing to bet all these government services would be bulldozed by private companies doing it better AND cheaper in a very short amount of time. And I would gladly voluntarily pay for it. People are broadly speaking paid their value in a market. Their skills their worth their rarity is balanced against the value that they provide to their customers or their employer. It may be a process but a free market without coercion is as fair as it gets. Where does your justice for the scientist come from? The scientists work ultimately has value from the amount of money people are prepared to pay and the cost of the future cancer cure. That s fairer than a board of fallible humans setting a price. Price fixing is almost never in line with what people would voluntarily pay or work for which is why it s an abject failure pretty much wherever it is tried. Government on the other hand is fundamentally no different really from a violent warlord and indeed historically it usually literally was a warlord taking things simply because they could do so by main force. Genghis Khan s empire was built literally on robbery on a grand scale. That s pretty much the purest form of government. The only thing that separates modern western democracy from Genghis Khan is the notion of collective good the idea that we pay tax in exchange for something back. Goods that are better provided collectively perhaps collective defence for example. That s all that makes taxation permissible ultimately the social contract is this dressed up. This guy hates freedom uses law as a inconsistent basis for morals doesn t factor in other forms of taxation makes ridiculous leaps of logic thanks to the mental gymnastics of his commie mind. Don t be a loon embrace freedom liberty. TaxationisTheftAP4LP Close but not exactly. Cancer scientist don t approach you on the street with a gun they use policemen for that.Immoral sex market give sex to people who do not necessarily deserve it but this problem should be solved through a law. There must be a sex tax where all the hotties would be forced to have sex with nerds like me. I d vote for that. Wow! It s hard to say anything about such a completely absurd essay. I m having a hard time coming up with adjectives bad enough. You don t get the gravity you deserve so we re going to make a law to fairly distribute that gravity so that the fat guy who weighs 700 pounds will be able to get around just as easily as the marathon runner. The market gave me money without me pointing guns at anybody to get it? Then it s mine. All mine. Absolutely fair. I don t owe you or anybody a single penny of it. Taxation is not only theft it s the very worst kind of theft extortion. A heinous crime. End it. Replace it with nothing. How some people comprehend this simple fact I ll never understand. Market is nothing more than a convention. It s not rational. It has no morality. It s mindless process. So no market doesn t give you what you deserve. In fact every known mathematical model of completely free market shows one stunning fact in the end of the process one entity owns everything. So if markets really gives you what you deserves it follows that with all probability you deserve nothing. A and B trade underwear for carrots.A does not deserve the carrots ? B does not deserve the underwear ?Please explain. B is forced under threat of violence by G to give 5 of his carrots to A. Does A deserve the carrots ?Please explain.  every known mathematical model of completely free market LOLPlease show just one. It is unfeasible to accurately predict the weather several days in advance although it is only dependent on deterministic physical processes.But somehow a phenomenon even more complex involving large numbers of conscious agents with changing preferences constraints and objectives may be predicted to a single outcome?Positivism does not apply to social sciences including the economy.  This feeling that your pretax income is your money is difficult to shake.  Apparently for some people such as the collectivist writer it s a concept that s impossible to fathom.If the person endeavoring to create value isn t entitled to it who is?If a person s creative efforts don t entitle her to control and dispose of her output or compensation for her output then what does? Extortion the exercise of political power doesn t seem to justify any claim on the output of another that s the morality of any robber.  If the person endeavoring to create value isn t entitled to it who is? You simply don t get the point. Money you earn is only a measure and very flawed one of real value you create. Money is not value money is not wealth. It s only accounting tool. In fact there is nothing simpler than earning money from destroying real wealth devastation of rainforests for example. If you confuse money with value no wonder you can t understand why we need taxation. You re living in the wonderland of circular logic. Your argument is irrelevant money just represents a figure to base all trade before we used to swap maybe a cow for 3 sheep etc. It was invented as a better way to value the trade of these goods. it also applies to services. So the money earned is a value of your servicegood that you have produced or own. You have sole rights to that goodservice. No one else does. So I think it is you who is confused between money and value as they are inherently and explicitly connected! WHAT UTTER RAMBLINGS!! your entire comment is circular and completely illogical money is what we use to establish worth instead of swapping 3 pigs for 1 cow we replace that with money the market i.e. how buying and selling is currently going dictates what that monetary figure is worth. So that money that you can then swap for things you need or want has worth! so now that bit of your argument is cleared off the board. lets get on to the understanding of needing tax . we don t its theft as I have it taken off me without my consent its that simple. as for the arguments about roads . I pay Road tax which is a choice as I bought a car again which is a choice. Police fire local government etc. I pay council tax that again is a choice semichoice as its a bit unfair that all don t have to pay it if I buy a house. but to tax my wages as well is just theft!  no wonder you can t understand why we need taxation Why then why do we need taxation? What justifies the use of compulsion for something that noncompulsive firms can do much better? But of course this academic who survives off of compulsion because few value his work finds it in his self interest to rationalize compulsion just as he justifies other ludicrous ideas poorly and inconsistently Even if individuals didn t have property rights in their income you d still have to explain why the government was entitled to take mone from them. Philosopher Michail huemer explains  How may a government finance its activities? The main method now used is coercive extraction of money from the population taxation. The prevalence of this method of finance is most likely due to the fact that it is a very reliable method of collecting very large amounts of money. But it is not normally permissible to coercively extract money from others even if you have a very good use for the money. On the face of it therefore taxation appears impermissible. That inference however seems to presuppose that individuals are justly entitled prima facie to their pretax incomes. Thomas Nagel and Liam Murphy have disputed this assumption. They believe that property rights are created by governmental laws and therefore that one only has property rights in those things to which the state s laws grant one ownership. By creating tax laws the state shapes the property rights that individuals have such that individuals own only their aftertax incomes. 9 In response there are three views one might hold regarding property rights. First one might hold that property rights are natural that is moral rights that exist prior to the state. John Locke for example held that individuals are justly entitled to the fruits of their labor even in a pregovernmental society. 10 On this view taxation would seem to be a prima facie injustice for whatever the ethically correct way of acquiring property may be it presumably is not forcible extraction of goods held by others. Second one might hold that property rights are partly natural in that there are certain broad principles of property that are valid independent of governmental laws but that there are many details of a regime of property rights that are not settled by these general moral principles. For instance perhaps our inherent moral rights determine that we are justly entitled to the fruits of our labor but these rights do not determine at what altitudes one may fly one s airplane over someone else s land. One might hold that statecreated laws are needed to settle such matters of detail. This view still offers little comfort to a defender of taxation for the entitlement of one agent to coercively extract vast quantities of resources from the rest of the population is not the sort of matter of detail like the altitude at which one may overfly others property that is plausibly taken to be left indeterminate by the basic moral principles of property. Third one might hold that there are no natural property rights. Nagel and Murphy assume that this means that property rights are created by governmental decree. This is plausible only for one who presupposes a strong doctrine of political authority. Nagel and Murphy ascribe to the state a moral entitlement arising from its power to create property rights to coercively enforce its chosen distribution of resources. Since no nongovernmental agent may declare a distribution of resources and a regime of property rights and then coercively enforce them the state s right to do so would require political legitimacy. At the same time the state s creation of a regime of property rights would presumably impose obligations on the part of citizens to respect that regime. These would be political obligations. If therefore the state has no authority it has no such power of creating property rights as Murphy and Nagel suppose. The result would seem to be that even after the state has made its laws there still are no property rights. If one finds this conclusion implausible one ought to return to the view that there are natural property rights. One might think the rejection of property rights leaves the way open for taxation since taxpayers have no right to their wealth the seizure of some of that wealth will no longer appear as a rights violation. But by the same token the state will have no right to that wealth either and thus citizens do no wrong by withholding it. Meanwhile there are the harms the state coercively imposes on those who fail to pay taxes and these would seem to be prima facie injustices. In short the defender of taxation must hold that the state rather than the taxpayers is justly entitled to the tax revenues that the state collects. There is no plausible way to defend this view unless one assumes a doctrine of political authority.  Huemer Michael 20121029. The Problem of Political Authority An Examination of the Right to Coerce and the Duty to Obey pp. 145146. Palgrave Macmillan. Kindle Edition.  and you won t be able to demonstrate that the state has legitimate authority as the rest of Huemer s book demonstrates. His reasoning is so circular and fallacious it s hard to believe this wasn t penned by an undergraduate student. First Just because the governments are granted the right and responsibility to tax for the common good allegedly having been granted such lowers by the populace it does not follow that the income generated is not belonging to the individual who is taxed. By majority consent we surrender our wealth to the governing body who in returns x y and z in a legal and social contract. We elect officials to legislate such collection. In this social contract the check and balances are as follows1. Everyone has skin in the game. Everyone pays.2. Because everyone has skin in the game we elect officials who will legislate sound financial policy providing necessary services within a manageable budget.3. Property and income is first and foremost held as belonging to individuals and collected via DUE PROCESS OF LAW. Make no mistake this socalled professor is lazy in his reasoning dangerous in his presuppositions. On the contrary. The whole idea that you deserve what you earn is circular and fallacious. It confuses money with wealth real value and by doing so makes money you earned wellearned by definition you deserve it because it s a value you brought to society or alternatively makes assumption that money is absolutely exact measure of real value you worked out. First attitude is circular second is simply false. It s child s exercise to show that money and wealth are two different things and that you can easily earn not only much more money than your work is worth in objective terms but you can make money from destroying wealth take industry which devastates natural resources or irresponsible banking which leads to economic crisis. Market is just social convention we may of course discuss what forms of taxation are more or less justified but the only rational measure you can use in such reasoning is improved wellbeing of society as a whole. Idealizing earnings and suggesting that taxation is just theft is simply infantile. Actually it s irresponsible governance which leads to economic crisis and irresponsible governance that leads to the destruction of natural resources. If you want to argue that taxation is morally right in order for the state to protect it s citizens then you must agree that the state is responsible for governance of the markets financial regulation and the conservation of natural resources. The state uses it s power to harvest our income to redistribute to it s cronies who it allows to destroy natural resources and run rampant without any kind of sensible financial regulation.The vast majority of victims of the tax thieves don t have access to the kind of power it takes to destroy wealth in the manner you describe what you describe is available only to the high and mighty friends of politicians and lobbyests. From this perspective withholding tax is the only moral approach as out taxes are being used to subsidise wealth destruction for the benefit of the political class and their friends. Industry does not destroy natural resources it transforms them to make them usable by society.Banking also is not a form of creating or destructing wealth rather just moving that already existing wealth from one s pocket to someone else s pocket.Wealth in service terms is not created just moved and wealth in industry terms is not created or destroyed but transformed. A tree has an amount x of worth a cut down and cleaned tree has an amount x1 of worth a processed tree made into wood boards has an amount x10 of worth and paper has an amount x100 of worth. It is still the same tree but effort time and labor put into it make it s worth rise. The fundamental issue of taxation is whether the individual owns his or her self. If so the fruit of his or her labor belongs to them and no one else. Taking it is theft. If not let s dispense with the nuance and call it what it is slavery as the individual does not own his or her self. Of course it is the beneficiaries of the State which always argue the hardest that taxation isn t theft since without it they think they d be out of a job. They can t fathom that they might compete in a free market because currently they have nothing to offer a free market but bad worthless ideas. So of course they desire the job security a monopoly on force and theft provides them. I wonder if Prof. Goff would support a taxation program to equalize his income down to the level of the rest of the world? Typically these Rawlsians do all kinds of mental gymnastics to justify income equalization within their own borders but aren t so keen about equalizing with say SubSaharan Africa. Their moral compass starts spinning in all kinds of different directions when their conceptions of justice would actually force significant lifestyle changes on themselves.  You clearly don t have a legal right to your pretax income as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it. This is a simple analytic truth that follows from the definition of taxation. People who don t take pay their taxes go or at least legally ought to go to gaol.   You clearly don t have a legal right to claim you are not a slave when you are legally declared to be a slave said the Southern slave owner to his slave. Slavery was legal. The internment of German Jews in German concentration camps was legal. Apartheid was legal. I had to stop at the halfway point. You made a statement that in my opinion is jumping over some huge gaps and to even consider the second half of your argument they need to be filled. it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pretax income for that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case.  Where do you get that rule from? Why does a moral right to one s income implies that distribution of that income is just? Further how is it not just? You claim that because a Banker gets more than a doctor who cures cancer it isn t just. But that seems rather than a repudiation of markets a repudiation of social norms because people in general value knowing their money is safe more than having a cure for cancer. It also implies that having a cure for cancer is itself valuable. One is a holder of tangible goods the other a holder of knowledge. As we know from history knowledge is cheap and usually easy to come by but few people take advantage of it. Finally what is justice and how does it apply to our sense of rights. Hayek dispelled the idea of social justice all together. Even Rawls agreed that distribution can be unequal if the outcome is better for the least of us. You seem to be playing loose with terms and coming to premature conclusions. Also the argument Nagel and Murphy make is rather different. Their main point is that because income and property cannot be protected without a state there is an implied necessity of a state for private ownership. There view essentially hurts Anarchist but nothing more. A Nozickian minarchy could still fit within that perimeter. I believe John Tomasi does a good job pointing this out in the book Free Market Fairness. I am guessing that your use of the phrase Taking money off us is a reference to the presumed naivete of your interlocutor. Or perhaps you simply cannot help but congratulate yourself at their expense. Why don t you come take what s mine by yourself instead of hiring thugs to do it for you? There was a time when even the least rigorous liberal arts bachelor s degree required the study of logic and fallacy in the freshman year to both prevent this sort of fallacious thinking from entering the public discourse or even worse being accepted and taken up by it. Sadly the diploma mills tend not to issue refunds their marks tend not to understand that they ve been ripped off and our society suffers profoundly as a result. How silly of me to think that my employer owns his income and decides how much of it to give to me. In fact everything is owned by the government. This essay is proof positive that having a PhD in philosophy isn t a guaranty for clear thinking. The writer assumes that the market throws money at you as though it were a sentient being and since this being throws around money unequally the money obtained by you is obtained unethically and therefore you have no right to it. This is why Government must take as much of that money away in order to make the throwing precisely equitable. a There is no such thing as a market. A market is a fictional concept. In the real world a market consists of humans who interact with each other trading goods services and financial instruments. That collection of human interactions is called a market . The market doesn t throw anything at anyone it does not gift anything nor does it distribute anything because it doesn t actually exist. So right off the bat the writer makes a bizarre categorical error as though the market is a sentient being that engages in an distribution of money. b The writer does not seem to have a clear concept of value or of ownership. In a nutshell people transfer money to others in return for something that in their mind is of equal or greater value. A salary is trade too trading your talents in exchange for money. Since value is subjective these exchanges necessarily are unequal. I might value something higher or lower than how you value it and therefore agree to pay for it more or less than you would. This is true of any financial transaction. If I have business X and you have business Y I based on a set of factors might value a given work slot at N dollars and you based a different set of factors might value a given work slot at M dollars. Workers will either agree or disagree to this level of compensation also based on their subjective value. The fact that my worker will get N dollars and your worker will get M dollar even if M N does not mean that either of these workers have obtained their income unethically or that this sentient being gifted them their salary unequally. Rather it means that they each provided different values to their employers and therefore received different levels of compensation. The compensation they receive is therefore wholly theirs and any funds take out of it by taxation is a taking of THEIR money. I should note that it s not clear why the writer limits his argument to pretax money since his argument holds equally also for posttax money you are not entitled to any money received above the point that is not 100 equal to the money each member of society received. Once we understand that the argument he is making is that no one has any right to anything above what each other member of society has the nonsensical nature of this argument becomes even clearer. a False. Market isn t a sentient being of course but that s exactly the point. It s a mindless process influenced by millions of factors therefore expecting that wealth distribution which it creates will be just is nonsensical. That s exactly the reason why we need some entity government which puts a human thought into it. If you run computer simulation of totally free market you will find very interesting thing. In the end of the process one entity owns everything. You end up with the same result even if you assume that investment may be successful only by sheer luck. Why? Because money earns money you can invest more with the same risk and gain greater profit or at the same amount with less risk. Purely by chance some entities accumulate better positions and at the end one entity takes all. Think about it for a moment. Maybe you will figure out how funny this is when you juxtapose this finding with assumption that you earn what you deserve. Because it would seem that from the two it follows you deserve nothing. And of course there is such a thing as market. Structure of this interactions you re talking about. Existing division of wealth and power attitudes and misconceptions shared by people rules of law governing this exchange etc. Most of it has nothing to do with justice and morality. Even sheer stupidity plays it part here. b False. There re objective values. To have a clear air is of value for everyone or at least it should be because if it isn t for x then x is sociopath meaning is hostile towards society and human race? And yet it s in direct opposition to many market forces. Why? Because and that s the thing you should learn a consumers are not rational b they don t possess absolute knowledge c there exist people and quite a lot of them who are completely unconcerned with wellbeing of others especially when others mean future generations. Sorry but I must add this. Once we understand that the argument he is making is that no one has any right to anything above what each other member of society has the nonsensical nature of this argument becomes even clearer. No this is not the point of the argument. The point of the argument is as follows. 1. One s earning are very flawed measure of value one brings into society understood as rate at which one s job is improving wellbeing of society as a whole 2. We don t know any better measure. 3. So we keep money but make some concession by paying taxes discussion about better or worst forms of taxes is completely different topic. Two other things to think about for you. There is a time aspect in real world. Most of mathematics which facilitates current economic and technological advancements was of no economical value when it was created. There re are many thing of great value for everyone who can call himself human looking in the mirror but of no economical worth. For example a drug for rare disease. My earnings are based not only in value of the service but what someone is willing to pay for the service but also supply and demand. If there are lots of people who can do a job stack shelves then it s going to lower paid than say someone who is an engineer. Also we have a choice on what we do. As your drug for a rare disease I think you ll find there is a lot of money in that area! I hope the amoral market doesn t gift you any money for writing this lazy crap. Laws are simply opinions backed up by guns. Nothing more other than sanctimonious pretense towards decency. Taxation is theft and anyone who argues differently is just exposing their utter contempt of their fellow human beings because everyone with more than 2 brains cells knows that taxation is not voluntary and consent is not required. I would hate to hear Phil Goff s opinion on rape vs. consensual sex. I shudder at the thought of all the excuses and circular reasoning he would come up with if not for the threat of violence that would be directed at him by feminist groups given his clear lack of morals. This is mind bogglingly inaccurate and shows a near complete lack of understanding of the parameters defining a lawfully binding contract.  Alain de Botton encourages us to think of taxation as charity we give up what s ours for the greater good of our society . It should be immediately apparent that charity is a voluntary act and as such we have every right to choose not to make a charitable donation. More to the point ALL lawfully binding contracts must be entered into voluntarily and with full disclosure. It should be noted that all legislation is in fact commerce admiralty law and as such can only apply to the legal fiction ALL CAPS NAME. Herein lies the deception from the day you were born you have been fooled into assuming that your given name and the legal fiction NAME were one and the same. This legal fiction was created by and is the property of the state and as such we place ourselves in dishonor by claiming to be the legal fiction. Your parents were forced to register from the word Regis meaning of the king your birth to the state upon this registration the legal fiction was created by the state. At no time was full disclosure of the nature of this registration provided. It should be immediately apparent that as this contract was not entered into voluntarily and full disclosure was not provided this contract is null void and cannot be lawfully binding. Yet we continue to accept liability for and act as surety for the legal fiction as we do not realize the difference. If you actually read the Income Tax Act 2007 you ll find it applies to person s BB 2 Main obligationsIncome tax liability1118A person s income tax liability for a tax year must be calculated and satisfiedby the person under subpart BC Calculating and satisfying income tax liabilities. We are specifically referred to the Interpretation Act 1999 for the definition of the word Person in bold no less! AA3 2 DefinitionsThe Interpretation Act 1999 also contains definitions of terms including in particular the term person and other provisions that apply to the interpretationand construction of this Act. The Interpretation Act defines the word person as Person includes a corporation sole a body corporate and anunincorporated body By the maxim of law inclusio unius est exclusio alterius meaning The inclusion of one is the exclusion of another we know that only these listed entities in commerce are therefore included. Clearly we the natural born men women upon this land are none of the above listed entities. How may know that the NZ government is actually a corporation called Her Majesty the Queen in Right of New Zealand listed with the securities exchange commission in Washington D.C. operating via the crown for the benefit of the state banking empire The City of London which can be traced back to the Knights Templar? I forgot to mention your employment contract is a private contract between you and you employer. As required in a lawfully binding contract you both exchange something of substance ie labour for money. No third party can enter your contract without the consent of both contractual parties. Incidentally the Wages Protection Act 1983 states the following which clearly shows that deductions cannot be made without our consent. 512Deductions with worker s consentAn employer may for any lawful purpose a with the written consent of a worker orb on the written request of a worker make deductions from wages payable to that worker.A worker may vary or withdraw a consent given or requestmade by that worker for the making of deductions from thatworker s wages by giving the employer written notice to thateffect and in that case that employer shall a within 2 weeks of receiving that notice if practicableandb as soon as is practicable in every other case cease making or vary as the case requires the deductions concerned. The mistake is using just and fair interchangably. Fairness is only one moral value of which there are many liberty consent tribal loyalty aversion to disgusting things and in fact fairness is not even useful as a moral principle it is a moral heuristic there is no real degree of fairness that we can nonarbitrarily say is fair enough or morally good . We can use fairness as a tiebreaker but we can t build a principled consistent theory of ethics on it.  that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pretax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pretax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer.  It is just as an outcome because the means by which it comes about voluntary transactions between consenting parties are just. You d be hard pressed to call something unjust when everybody involved went into it voluntarily and got what they wanted. How can the sum of all such perfectlyjust acts be an injustice? Of course it is also possible for income inequality to come about by completely unjust means profiting from a governmentgranted monopoly backed by force of law gaming the system of governmentenforced regulations madeup laws etc. The selfevidence of the violence inherent in the government will be transparent the moment I don t voluntarily hand over my stash. Philip Goff is simply a coward who lacks the balls to come steal my stuff in person. He d much rather keep his dirty soul clean by sending his goon squad over to take my stuff. If I resist his goons will throw me in a cage. If I resist being thrown in a cage they ll beat me and or murder me where I stand. His argument should replace the words tax payer with either slave or at the least serf so that we know exactly the relationship between the State and the Individual. httppraxeology.netLSNT6.htm or to sum it up I didn t sign any contract social or otherwise  I read enough. People shouldn t bother to read all this diatribe. If you point a gun to my head and force me to give you the money I worked hard to earn call it whatever you like it s still theft. It doesn t matter what ensues after my money or property is forcefully taken from me. It s still theft. Just like it doesn t matter if I pay my wife dinner in an expensive restaurant after beating her up. It s still an abusive relationship. No sophistry on your part or meanderings about some sort of social contract which neither I nor anyone has ever signed will change that reality. If it s involuntary not charity as you attempt to purport. it s coercion. It s theft it s violence. End of story. It s in moments like this that I have greater respect for classical marxists or fascists. At least they have the decency or I daresay the balls to admit that they approve of violence coercion and confiscation of property against peaceful individuals in order to promote what they see as the ideal society. You own your body you own your time and you own the fruits of your labor. If someone try s to take this from you without your consent that is called theft Even when a group of people call themselves government and then vote to take your property from you without your consent this is still theft. It is embarrassing that this needs explained to people. Nothing gives you a right to force me to work for you. Are we free or are we slaves? You consume services you pay for the services. The rule of law and all that. It s a bit like shopping. So not paying tax in this way of looking at it is the equivalent of theft you get something but you don t pay for it. What if I do not want anything from the government because I believe free market would provide me the same much cheaper? like er reliable courts a properly organised national transport system trustworthy police urban sewers . . . Why can t the free market do these? just looks like lack of imagination What an awful article clearly written by someone bitter they don t earn enough? Scholars should earn more than bankers? What a hippie concept The Hebrew God will straighten you out article author when HE sends you to your eternal damnation. This planet belongs to HIM he sets the rules and you are outside HIS rules. Taxation is theft money does belong to the person that earns it and politicians will spend the same time in HELL that you do all eternity. I will laugh until the end of time at morons like you. Besides which the civil war will prove you wrong in this life and you will still not believe it. Money created by government s master in America the New York bankers by fractional reserve banking and those that do are again wrong and again damnation awaits them and you. This is probably the stupidest article I ve ever read. I m having a hard time believing that this was written by a professor of anything. Let s quickly destroy both of his ridiculous arguments  You clearly don t have a legal right to your pretax income as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it. This is a simple analytic truth that follows from the definition of taxation. People who don t take pay their taxes go or at least legally ought to go to gaol. Talk about circular logic. Just because paying tax is a legal requirement this does not mean that it isn t tantamount to state theft. Any jackass in a position of power and authority can create whatever arbitrary laws he or she wishes to make and then demand that the populace adheres to them. When we are stating that taxation is theft we are stating that any laws requiring us to pay taxes are morally bankrupt lacking in legitimacy and in a sane society would be completely ignored.  So if there is a general right to one s pretax income then it must be a moral right. This is the only part that we both agree on.  But it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pretax income for that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case. You are confusing two completely different issues and then using one to justify the other. How much money a person makes is nothing to do with the topic at hand the distribution of incomes is irrelevant. If I agree to be paid 10 a year to do a job then that is the amount of money that my employer and I have agreed as compensation for my services. If someone in another company gets paid 1000 to do a different job then that has nothing to do with me. Salaries are based on many market forces such as the demand for specific skills and the amount of professional experience someone brings with them. This is not a moral issue it is a contractual issue based upon the eternal market forces of supply and demand.  There is no justice in the fact that the pretax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pretax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer. This is just an accident of the way our market economy is structured. It s not an accident. Your subjective ideals do not change the fact that the city bankers generates large amounts of revenue for his or her company whereas the cancer researcher does not generate any income at least not until a cure is found and possibly patented. The argument that taxation is theft is certainly a moral issue no government has any right to demand a percentage of every citizen s income and threaten noncompliance with jail time. If I work to earn money in exchange for my time and skills then that money is mine. If the government takes a large chunk of that money against my wishes then that is theft. If the government tells me to pay this money or else go to jail then that is extortion and blackmail and the government reveals itself to be little more than another mob gang engaged in a protection racket pay up or else! To sum your whole lengthy argument in one sentence you re simply an egoist with no concern for others. It s the only possible explanation besides stupidity for stating which you did just maybe don t realize it s true that in economy driven by pure market forces there is simply no place for many advanced branches of mathematics which may be of no economic value for centuries as it was with number theory or no such value at all we simply cannot know that in advance or drugs for rare diseases completely worthless economically but hey that s simply the way free market is working so be it. Two other things. Can you tell mi how is that that highly taxed societies Scandinavian for example are better of than most of the world and how is it a theft when everyone s situation and whole surrounding are constantly improving? Second your assumption that after eliminating income tax you will save additional money in amount which was taxed before is wrong the whole economy will change for example you may deal with higher inflation. That is stupid. Inflation is in practice a form of taxation.The government issues more currency for it to spend which causes most of the population lose spending power with the higher prices inflated currency.Plus the question is not Is the market fair? The market is the sum of people s free economic choices. Fair or not fair people earn their wealth in the marktplace through VOLUNTARY exchanges If something or someone isn t worth what is asked you can simply say No deal! . The opposite of coercive taxation. I love it when someone calls me an egoist and stupid and then asks me questions. If you think I m a stupid egoist why are you asking me any questions? You should not care about my opinions in the slightest. The argument you presented was utterly fallacious and lacking in substance. Given that I ve not resorted to such asinine namecalling with you I ll ask you some questions instead please state how these highly taxed societies are better off than most of the world ? Please explain how these highly taxed societies being apparently better off actually makes the process of taxation any more legitimate? It doesn t matter whether their situation is improving or not this does NOT make the state theft of people s income any more legitimate. You also clearly don t understand what inflation is if you think that this will increase due to a lack of taxation. Please explain WHY the money supply will be inflated in the absence of the taxation system?  Can you tell mi how is that that highly taxed societies Scandinavian for example are better of than most of the world and how is it a theft when everyone s situation and whole surrounding are constantly improving?  Simply put because your facts are wrong. The Scandinavian countries are abandoning socialism en masse and are incrementally enacting free market economic policies. Jason heshe has no argument they are a a typical far left wing socialist they think they have some higher moral standing it all comes crashing down when it comes down to freedom they believe in freedom as long as you agree with them if you don t your chastised as you have been. Basically it all comes down to in hisher eyes that we are not free our lives are not our own as we do not have the choice as you have said we are held to ransom by the goverment pay up or else! I would think a professor of philosophy would understand what a logical fallacy was and realize this is complete nonsense What an incredibly convoluted and dishonest attempt to rationalise criminal behavior! The unbridled arrogance and delusional belief that they alone know what s best for everyone combined with the ego to impose their will on the great unwashed masses whether they want it or not Such people are disgusting. Government is not a charity and spending other people s money is not philanthropy but it sure is fun and easy and virtually guarantees a dependent voting bloc of dependents. A government which robs Peter to pay Paul can always depend on the support of Paul Actual charitable contributions are entirely voluntary whereas government mandated confiscation through taxation absolutely is theft. Mandatory Contribution is a contradiction in terms. If you want to pursue a particular social agenda you are free to start your own charity for that express purpose. Do not assume it is any part of the role of government or that your social agenda is the same as anyone else s. You have no right to force others to fund the things you want them to outsourcing your crimes to proxy government does not absolve you personally of all wrongdoing you are still an accomplice in the government s crimes. Bastiat called it Plunder When a portion of wealth is transferred from the person who owns it without his consent and without compensation and whether by force or by fraud to anyone who does not own it then I say that property is violated that an act of plunder is committed How is this legal plunder to be identified? Quite simply. See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what the citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime Fr d ric Bastiat The Law p. 21 26  When under the pretext of fraternity the legal code imposes mutual sacrifices on the citizens human nature is not thereby abrogated. Everyone will then direct his efforts toward contributing little to and taking much from the common fund of sacrifices. Now is it the most unfortunate who gains from this struggle? Certainly not but rather the most influential and calculating. Fr d ric Bastiat Bastiat is irrelevant. He has been since he started. He appeals to fringe cranks whose cherished erroneous belief that taxation is theft is a bedrock principle of economics. It is not. It is the credo of the libertarian freeloader. Social goals are real and you libertarian freeloaders sure take advantage of clean water satellites the internet defense safe food and on and on but you don t want to pay for it. If you don t like paying taxes to support your lazy behind then move to the libertarian paradise of Somalia. And we adults have to suffer your seemingly interminable selfishness and stupidity. Free loader? And who says I agree with what the goverment use the money for? Over 34 of the tax in the uk is spent on welfare! I don t want my money going to those free loader those who don t work who just free loaded through life those who didn t plan or take responsibility for them selves. As for your other pints I think you will find that majority of it is privately funded through your water bill internet bill etc etc  Libertarians want the freedom to choose what to pay for voluntarily. You on the other hand are in favor of taking other people s money to support social programs whether the taxed person uses them or not. Freedom without rules is the freedom of the fox in the henhouse.it s the game of football without the referee.you need strong safeguards against predators. And that requires tax to build the fences. To smash the monopolies. To unrig the markets. To educate the population so they can avoid serfdom.That delivers real freedom. I just wasted ten minutes of my life listening to some cuck try to statesplain to me how he s entitled to the fruits of my labor. Cool story bro. hey gimmie your money then dont be a hypocrite its not yours its MINE Personally I have long agreed with the concept of a laissezfaire society since it is the only moral choice being based on truth. Self ownership is innate and is not morally challengable.Self ownership entitles all people to use 100 of their own resources to survive prosper and thrive.Diminishing peoples ability to utilise 100 of their own resources by any means including taxation ultimately demonstrates that we are not entitled to self ownership and are therefore still slaves. The exchange of ideas and the division of labour is humanities crowning acheivement.There is no endeavor that is more human or of higher moral value. Voluntaryism is something I am in favour of to all those statists who feel that services should be payed for. NO REVOLUTION REQUIRED!People just need to think for themselves. Exactly but it HAS to be voluntary not under duress or threat of life changing consequences. I go to work I earn money I see this as a fair trade of my time knowledge. But I also help others in work and go beyond my obligation to just work teachinghelping those I work with it isn t part of my remit and I get paid no extra for it I choose to help them mainly because i know they will use that knowledge to better them selves this gives them the oppressed in the future to hopefully earn more. That is my choice to do that I pass on my knowledge and most I have paid for out of my own pocket! As soon as you are forced it is theft. I think the moral responsibility to pay for public service exists. It is the means in which the money is gathered that is immoral. The initiation of force is not justified. In pretty much all of these cases taxation becomes extortion since the choice is removed. so you ll individually volunteer to pay for the roads that I use then? If not you who will? Ah road tax which is voluntary as I can choose whether I want a car or not! What you ve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it I award you no points and may God have mercy on your soul? Lol I think Billy Madison s critical analysis of the Industrial Revolution was more grounded in reality than Goff s post. Merriam Webster definition of THEFT1athe act of stealing specifically the felonious taking and removing of personal property with intent to deprive the rightful owner of it If one person stealing from another is theft then one group of people stealing from another group is massive theft. The notion that a large group of people can grant magical powers to politicians just by voting is nonsense. The majority simply has enough physical force to enslave the minority. Majority oppressing minority democracy is still oppression! Pointing a gun at me gives you the POWER to rob me but not the RIGHT to do so. Claiming taxes are not theft because they provide essential services would follow logically that it s ok for me to rob you at gunpoint as long as I give you a handjob after. Fuck your essential services. The free market is driven by productivity. The government is driven by war. Maybe the free market doesn t always provide EQUAL pay to everyone but neither does government! I d be happy to pay a voluntary contribution to essential services in society in exchange for no more taxes. This way we d be free to decide for ourselves what essential services actually are what level of quality we want and how much we are willing to pay for them. Next time I hit a pothole and get a flat tire or the trash guy leaves my can in the street or a cop writes dozens of petty nuisance tickets to exploit the community he s supposed to protect I d love to be able to FIRE them and hire a better company. The ONLY basis for determining if a wage is just or unjust is wether or not it was voluntarily agreed to. Did you agree to work for 50k while the CEO works for 500k? If you think that is unjust then don t take the job negotiate for more or negotiate for less for the CEO. If you agree to the salary your offered then what is unjust about it. By what right does a third party have to come into the middle of this transaction and declare an injustice where the two parties involved have an agreement. There can be no injustice where there is an agreement. The problem here is third actors who have a vision of society they prefer and no one is going along with their ideals and are instead pursuing their own interests. So these busy bodies like the author of this article have no trouble with coercing others out of their money on the basis that they think there is an injustice when no one else involved does. If this were the case then why use the government as a middle man? Just walk up to a rich man shove a gun in his belly and demand he give 90 of his income to charity. Somehow I doubt this author or any other SJW types will have the courage of their convictions to do such a thing even though it is precisely what they want the government to do in their stead.  So if there is a general right to one s pretax income then it must be a moral right. But it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pretax income for that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case.  This is the crux of your argument. Unfortunately for your argument it is illogical and a fallacious misstep. The moral right to your pretax income plays out like this you are entitled to a good or service for which you have already paid. Your labor skllls knowledge whathaveyou is yours to provide. You can work or not work. If I decide I want to work I find an employer who will pay me to do so. There are interviews contractsagreements etc. I will do X for you and in exchange you will provide me with Y amount of dollars. You are entitled to Y. Whether or not the company is overpaying you. Whether or not it seems asinine that Miley Cyrus makes more money than any professor of any subject at any school is irrelevant. If they wanted to make the money Miley Cyrus makes and they could do what she does better than her then they have the choice to pursue that economic goal. To suggest that a deliberate action or policy cannot be moral because the market is not moral implies that the foundation of any morality is affected by accidents. It is not. Your article is one written with notsohidden undertones that you don t like that work that is important in YOUR opinion doesn t get as much money as it should. That has nothing do with morality at least not in the way you suggest. You shouldn t have taken the left at Albuquerque in the hunt for the mark that you missed. What an excellent response! You are entitled to the money you receive because every party involved in providing you with that money has agreed on the terms of payment. If you want more money there are countless opportunities to do so in a free economy. Wage injustice is an important matter but it does not give government the right to take of its citizens incomes whatever it deems appropriate. What is the functional difference between a aggregate tax rate of 85 to 90 percent and indentured servitude or slavery? 10 to 15 of the fruits of your labor isn t much but not outside the realm of possibility in some socialist countries. At some point the suckers are just going to vote with their feet  The whole system is wrong e.g. Monetary we should all be resource based and use them collectively for the greater good of humanity. Check out the Venus Project on Google search Article writer the Hebrew God will straighten out your wrong thinking when HE sends those of you that believe it is not your money thereby taxation is not theft to HELL for violating HIS Ten Commandments. In the meantime it is going to be civil war soon in America to rid America of the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Reserve Board. It may be legally by the Congress and President Donald Trump to restore the Constitution from thieving immigrants andor democrats like you but more likely it will be by war. Many voters for the democratic party and Hillary Clinton will be determined to have voted illegally those will be removed by deportation. Declared war by Congress at President Donald Trumps request may yet happen to destroy Mexico when it becomes necessary due to as a result of some treaty Mexico achieves with China. Behold Exhibit A for control freaks. These control freaks believe that the distribution of wealth through the natural micronegotiations of each individual in the market is skewed. Somehow with the aid of angels in the persons of our righteous politicians this unfair distribution can be rectified. Well dream on. Trim your faith for your utopia is almost nigh. What s wrong with each of us indivifually negotiating our share of society s wealth in a free unfettered market? Why do we need politicians to negotiate each of our share? Aren t they leeches who are unnecessary? This world is so chaotic because instead of channeling our resources to efficiently run our society we give it to politicians. What a waste. This is a joke. People have no claim on the compensation for which they are trading their labor?You are tacitly advocating slavery. It s incredible to think that an adult wrote an article of such breathtaking stupidity. It s almost autistic to believe that people should be paid according to some kind of divine justice rather than according to the value of their work. The claims i that there are no property rights independent of government laws and ii that the government can create property rights simply by declaring that something belongs to someone. There is no obvious reason to believe either i or ii and both claims are counterintuitive.Imagine that you travel to a remote region outside any government s jurisdiction where you find a hermit living off the land. The hermit hunts with a spear of his own making which you find interesting. You decide without the hermit s consent to take the spear with you when you leave. It would seem correct to say that you stole the spear. This shows the implausibility of i.Next imagine that you are a slave in the nineteenthcentury American South. Suppose you decide to escape from your master without your master s consent. If ii is true then you would be violating your master s rights by stealing yourself. Note that you would not merely be violating a legal right if ii is true the government creates moral rights and obligations through its laws so you would be violating your master s moral rights. This shows the implausibility of ii. Only one kind of taxation is not theft and that is what comes from the rent from the privatization of land. Socially Just Taxation and Its 17 Effects On Government Land Owners Communities and Ethics Our present complicated system for taxation is unfair and has many faults. The biggest problem is to arrange it on a socially just basis. Many companies employ their workers in various ways and pay them diversely. Since these companies are registered in different countries for a number of categories the determination the criterion for a just tax system becomes impossible particularly if based on a fair measure of human workactivity. So why try when there is a better means available which is really a true and socially just method?Adam Smith Wealth of Nations 1776 REF. 1 says that land is one of the 3 factors of production the other 2 being labor and durable capital goods. The usefulness of land is in the price that tenants pay as rent for access rights to the particular site in question. Land is often considered as being a form of capital since it is traded similarly to other durable capital goods items. However it is not actually manmade so rightly it does not fall within this category. The land was originally a gift of nature if not of God for which all people should be free to share in its use. But its sitevalue greatly depends on location and is related to the community density in that region as well as the natural resources such as rivers minerals animals or plants of specific use or beauty when or after it is possible to reach them. Consequently most of the land value is created by man within his society and therefore its advantage should logically and ethically be returned to the community for its general use as explained by Martin Adams in LAND 2015 REF 2.. However due to our existing laws land is owned and formally registered and its value is traded even though it can t be moved to another place like other kinds of capital goods. This right of ownership gives the landlord a big advantage over the rest of the community because he determines how it may be used or if it is to be held out of use until the city grows and the site becomes more valuable. Thus speculation in land values is encouraged by the law in treating a site of land as personal or private property as if it were an item of capital goods although it is not Prof. Mason Gaffney and Fred Harrison The Corruption of Economics 2005 REF. 3. Regarding taxation and local community spending the municipal taxes we pay are partly used for improving the infrastructure. This means that the land becomes more useful and valuable without the landlord doing anything heshe will always benefit from our present tax regime. This also applies when the status of unused land is upgraded and it becomes fit for community development. Then when this news is leaked after landlords and banks corruptly pay for this information speculation in land values is rife. There are many advantages if the land values were taxed instead of the many different kinds of productionbased activities such as earnings purchases capital gains home and foreign company investments etc. with all their regulations complications and loopholes. The only people due to lose from this are the army of tax collectors employed by the government as well as those who exploit the growing values of the land over the past years. Here mere land ownership confers a financial benefit without the owner doing a scrap of work. Consequently for a truly socially just kind of taxation to apply there can only be one method LandValue Taxation. Consider how land becomes valuable. New settlers in a region begin to specialize and this improves their efficiency in producing specific goods. The central land is the most valuable due to easy availability and least transport needed. This distribution in land values is created by the community and after an initial start not by the natural resources. As the city expands speculators in land values will deliberately hold potentially useful sites out of use until planning and development have permitted their values to grow. Meanwhile there is fierce competition for access to the most suitable sites for housing agriculture and manufacturing industries. The limited availability of useful land means that the high rents paid by tenants make their residence more costly and the provision of goods and services more expensive. It also creates unemployment causing wages to be lowered by the monopolists who control the big producing organizations and whose land was already obtained when it was cheap. Consequently this basic structure of our current macroeconomics system works to limit opportunity and to create poverty see above reference. The most basic cause of our continuing poverty is the lack of properly paid work and the reason for this is the lack of opportunity of access to the land on which the work must be done. The useful land is monopolized by a landlord who either holds it out of use for speculation in its rising value or charges the tenant heavily for its right of access. In the case when the landlord is also the producer heshe has a monopolistic control of the land and of the produce too and can charge more for this access right than what an entrepreneur who seeks greater opportunity normally would be able to afford. A wise and sensible government would recognize that this problem derives from lack of opportunity to work and earn. It can be solved by the use of a tax system which encourages the proper use of land and which stops penalizing everything and everybody else. Such a tax system was proposed 136 years ago by Henry George a North American economist but somehow most macroeconomists seem never to have heard of him in common with a whole lot of other experts. I would guess that they don t want to know which is worse! In Progress and Poverty 1879 REF. 4 Henry George proposed a single tax on land values without other kinds of tax on produce services capital gains etc. This regime of land value tax LVT has 17 features which benefit almost everyone in the economy except for landlords taxmen and banks whowhich do nothing productive and find that land dominance has its own reward. 17 Aspects of LVT Affecting Government Land Owners Communities and Ethics 1. LVT adds to the national income as do other taxation systems but it should replace them.2. The cost of collecting the LVT is less than for all other productionrelated taxes since tax avoidance becomes impossible the various sites are visible to all and their ownership is public knowledge.3. Consumers pay less for their purchases due to lower production costs see below. This creates greater satisfaction with the management of national affairs.4. The speculation in and withholding of unused land is eliminated see item 7 and the national economy stabilizes. It no longer experiences the 18 year business boombust cycle due to periodic speculation in land values see below. 5. LVT is progressive owners of the most potentially productive sites pay the most tax. Urban sites provide the most usefulness and resulting tax. Big rural sites have less value and can be farmed appropriately to their ability to provide useful produce.6. The land owner pays his LVT regardless of how his site is used. A large proportion of the present groundrent from tenants becomes the LVT with the result that land has less salesvalue but a significant rental value even when it is not used.7. LVT stops speculation in land prices because the withholding of land from proper use is not worthwhile.8. The introduction of LVT initially reduces the sales price of sites even though their rental value can still grow over a longer term. As more sites become available the competition for them is less fierce.9. With LVT land owners are unable to pass the tax on to their tenants as rent hikes due to the reduced competition for access to the additional sites that come into use.10. With LVT land prices will initially drop. Speculators in land values will want to foreclose on their mortgages and withdraw their money for reinvestment. Therefore LVT should be introduced gradually to allow these speculators sufficient time to transfer their money to companyshares etc. and simultaneously to meet the increased demand for produce see below items 12 and 13. 11. With LVT there is an incentive to use land for production or residence rather than it being unused.12. With LVT greater working opportunities exist due to cheaper land and a greater number of available sites. Consumer goods become cheaper too because entrepreneurs have less difficulty in startingup their businesses and because they pay less groundrent demand grows unemployment decreases.13. Investment money is withdrawn from land and placed in durable capital goods. This means more advances in technology and cheaper goods too. 14. The collection of taxes from productive effort and commerce is socially unjust. LVT replaces this national extortion by gathering the surplus rental income which comes without any exertion from the land owner or by the banks LVT is a natural system of national incomegathering.15. The previous bribery and corruption for gaining privileged information about land cease. Before this was due to the leaking of news of municipal plans for housing and industrial development causing shockwaves in local land prices and municipal workers and lawyers bank balances.16. The improved use of the more central land of cities reduces the environmental damage due to a unused sites being dumpinggrounds and b the smaller amount of fossilfuel use when traveling between home and workplace.17. Because the LVT eliminates the advantage that landlords currently hold over our society LVT provides a greater equality of opportunity to earn a living. Entrepreneurs can operate in a natural way to provide more jobs because their production costs are reduced. Then untaxed earnings will correspond to the value that the labor puts into the product or service. Consequently after LVT has been properly and fully introduced as a single tax it will eliminate poverty and improve business ethics. References1. Adam Smith The Wealth of Nations 1776.2.

Taxation is a cog in the machine of Control.httpswww.youtube.comwatch?vBGhY2KKgJsE I don t find the author s argument convincing because it would also seem to justify allowing poor people to steal whatever they want from rich people in order to make it more fair . However I do think taxes are morally justifiable for a different reason. I would want to draw the analogy between taxation and credit card transaction fees. If one does not see these fees as theft then why would it be theft for the government to impose a transaction fee on the use of currency that they themselves created when the option of using barter is still open to anyone? The expenditures of government are ultimately just as necessary for the legitimacy of currency as a bank s expenses are necessary for the maintenance of its transaction system. Income inequality is THE most fallible argument against taxation being theft. You don t let the market work then blame the market for supply and demand issues? That s utterly incoherent to facts and economically illiterate. Wrong. Taxation is theft because money is a figment of the government s imagination. That stuff in your wallet has value because the government says it does not because it actually does. It is B s not for the greater good for individuals only for the Giants that consume us and leave us struggling and inbondage . Maybe tax s would be that bad if u make more they take more if I make 1500 in a week and I do I may see 1000 plus I pay child support . These days a thousand a week is not good money tax s are up groceries and every Dame thing is taxed tax tax tax it s B s it s robbery !!!!!!!!! Stop stealing are hard earned money lower the amount we take stop forcing people to jack prices up on everything we buy . Your government doesn t provide medical care.The retirement age is constantly being raised.The majority of expenses are military related.The funds are stolen squandered or used for backdoor corporate deals. Taxation is theft the Almighty not only disagrees with you but HE has sworn by HIS word that that sin and other sins will cost you your soul. You liberal democrats did not change the Constitution. You will be damned. Hi Dennis Richardson The extra charges of a government on the purchasing of property in the London can be eliminated easily with in a seven days according to the rules and regulations of a governmentIf you write an application with the authentic reasons for a elimination of property tax after reading the list of highest property tax rates and also attached a legal documents of a property tax pairs after that submitted in the government office by the tax layers which is helpful for you to approved the claim of your property tax in the seven days without any allegations of a government on the application of your property tax Remember don t write any irreverent reasons in the applications of property tax you want to submit in the office of government and also don t attached any illegal or extra document of property which increase the chances to refuse or neglect your claim application So keep it in your mind all the instructions and requirements given to you by the tax layer after concerning this kind of matter according to the current policy of government .Thanks. taxation IS theft. Why should I pay 0 in one great country and 50 in another? I don t see the value. There are countries with no capital gains tax 0 and are very developed very great places to live. There is no justification for theft when compared on a global basis. It s just value proposition and high taxes is a scam. Utter garbage. No one deserves any income unless they work. They deserve to keep whatever they earn. In simplest terms if you ask 100 for your widget and I agree to give you the asking price we have a contract. After the deal is made you then demand an extra 8 for the government . That was not negotiated or agreed upon. Breach of contract. How about if you need work done and offer 15 per hour. I agree to do the work for the asking price. We have a contract. When I finish the work we agree that I worked 10 hours so you pay me 130 explaining that you decided to withhold 20 for the government . Breach of contract. That withholding was not discussed negotiated or agreed upon. Just because our society has institutionalized and normalized this imposition of slicing off a piece for the government does not change the fact that on its face these contracts are made without explicit concession and identification of these amounts that the government takes from the transaction and therefore this extra taking is legitimately considered to be theft by all good and rational people. It debases the language and clarity of doing business. It muddies the water and creates an expectation that one can never really know what one will pay for goods or get paid for one s labor . Trust and confidence is destroyed people live with a rumbling dissatisfaction and anger in their gut and productivity is defeated by uncertainty. Then the monopolists run roughshod over the people because there s nothing we can do about it.  The argument about the amorality of the market is asinine. Whether the wages are fair relative to someone else s wages is irrelevant to the fact that they are your agreedupon wages. In a free society you get to choose your profession. You also get to choose what wages you will accept for a given job. What you do not get to choose is what wages someone will give you for your chosen job. If you don t agree with the wages you may choose to seek them elsewhere or you are also free to choose another career. If your goal is to make money become the banker. If your goal is to cure cancer become the scientist. If your goal is to cure cancer but you don t believe you are being offered a fair wage to do so you must weigh for yourself your desire to cure cancer against your desire to make money. Even if you somehow see an amorality in the relative wages which is not objective and can be argued some would say that the service the banker offers affects more people more directly and more often and therefore would assign more value rightly or wrongly to that than to the abstract cure for cancer that they may get someday but also may not this amorality does not somehow mean that the wages are not yours. We may politically shout about how certain professions e.g. teachers should receive more money but what we are willing to pay is the actual test is how much we are willing to pay for the service offered. Most people are willing to pay less for research because everyone believes cancer will not affect them or are willing to chance it against how much they are willing to pay towards the research or pay teachers less because the education levels of the masses is an abstract concept that concerns the average person less than the concrete question of who is handling my money that I need to live every day the banker. TLDR even if you see the market as amoral that doesn t somehow equate to your wages not being your wages. You have personal liberties and are not obligated to contribute to the morality of society. Just tell people their net wages when advertising jobs not their gross wages and we wouldn t have nutters claiming tax is theft. You agree to give your labour for the amount you receive after income tax not before. Tax on your salery was never yours it was never given to you in the first place therefore it s not theft to take it alway. Simple! You don t claim a right to every penny that your employment generates for the company you work for so don t claim every penny that you employment generates for society that allows you that employment opportunity in the first place. So then your employer is the one getting robbed by the gov t instead of you. This is without a doubt one of the stupidest articles on the subject I ve read. The mental gymnastics it took to try and say that we re not entitled to our incomes is absolutely astounding. Clearly does not understand the premise of basic logic. Taxation is not theft because taxes are not the property of the tax payer they are the property of the government. Absurd logic. If I plant an apple seed on my land and nurture it for years untill I have a tree that produces apples and one year I get 100 apples from my tree The 100 are mine if I leave them at home but as soon as I exchamge them for money I am robbed of a part of my hard earned work through these so called taxes so its theft. All 100 apples belong to me and I am entitled to the full ammount of cash I get from them. You have to be kidding me dude ever heard of a little document called the declaration of independence it plainly states the gov. Only gains the authority the people give it and should the people decide to resend their concent the gov has absolutely no authority or power. Also what gives someone the moral right or the authority to take someone s money in the form of taxes and to determine what is fair for another to keep. This whole article is liberal crap that is more about wealth distribution than taxation.  Government says its legal therefore its legal has some merit logically speaking. Although there are all sorts of behaviors that were legal when X government did them that I bet the author would take significant issue with so this argument falls flat.  The market doesn t reward effort in the manner that I believe it should reward effort therefore you are not deserved of the money you make is meritless to the extreme to the point of idiocy. Not to mention the author offers exactly no metric or method by which he would reward effort although we can probably assume that the method would be forcible government confiscation and redistribution so he doesn t offer any alternative means let alone substantiating logic by which to determine the just distribution of compensation his argument is predicated on. Poor paper as author jumps right over main controversy. Is there a legal of moral right to tax income. Author writes You clearly don t have a legal right to your pretax income as you are legally obliged to pay tax on it . That s the controversy we had no income tax in America for a hundred years minus a civil war. So if this paper was written in that time it has no merit. Then a temporary tax on income was put in place and it stuck as once agencies and workers received benefits from others they were not going to give it up. So we have half our country s history where there was no income tax a person was entitled to their full pretax income and half our history with income tax which was better? That is the question and where the author should have gone in debate? Why was income picked why property? Better question why tax in general why not specific fees? Maybe because originally tax was easiest and income and property are biggest monetary amounts to deal with. Are we not more sophisticated than that? If I stay local why do I pay for interstate roads? Why not tax car and vehicle owners who travel interstate for that? If I pay the bus or taxi my fee contribution to infrastructure it uses is built into the fee. If I drive local why not have local plates that are not allowed on interstates and only pay toward local roads? If my children or myself go to school I pay fees to education if they don t or I don t go to school I don t pay a fee. What about serving underprivileged areas that cannot provide? That s where charity and social organization s step in. If people feel the compassion then they support directly to support underprivileged. If society doesn t have the compassion or support then as sad as it sounds why would their representative elected officials go opposite their wish and force to take the money and put it where the people would not otherwise want it to go? In short fees not taxes support what individuals are willing and wanting to support not what well polished lobbyists and manipulative journalist or shall we say kingship political systems deems society must support.  it is implausible to suppose that each person has a moral right to his or her pretax income for that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case.  The market consists of 320 million people but somehow a relative handful of bureaucrats with a long and dubious history of fraud waste scandal and abuse know better what the just distribution of pretax incomes should be for those 320 million. While the author spews his piffle surrounded by all the most important things in his life which were made available to him by the market at a price he could afford. Meanwhile the USPS still can dependably deliver the mail and Americans students in government schools aren t even in the top 20 in the world in math science and reading. Such ignorance in this day and age of access to information is a choice.  ..for that would imply that the distribution of pretax incomes the market happens to throw up is perfectly just and this is clearly not the case. There is no justice in the fact that the pretax income of a City banker is many hundreds of times the pretax income of scientist working on a cure for cancer.  Of course there s justice on the distribution of pretax income the market happens to throw up. Actually the market does not reward the importance of a service that is provided such as being a doctor. The market rewards the added value created to the consumer. And consumers value services in order to their needs and desires. There s nothing more democratic than the market if there aren t govermenet interferences. So of course taxes are theft. The Force of Law is often wrongly attributed.More correctly is should be stated as the Law of Force as this accurately describes our common situation of coercion.Academics be damned! Their convoluted diatribes are not progress just maintenance for the status quo. To put this simply I as an individual cannot confer rights to others singularly or enmass that I do not have in the first instance. This is straight up garbage. Anything extracted from the owner involuntarily is theft. Doing so under color of authority does not change that. To accept this extremely liberal answer would be to accept that everyone is taxed equally everywhere. They aren t and by your philosophy there s no moral difference if the government TOOK 33 of your money or TOOK 100 of it. Make no mistake they re taking YOUR money or they ll take your freedom. There s a whole other debate on whether or not how they spend it is efficient or not but we give our opinion on that debate when we cast our ballot. I don t have a problem with taxation as such. What I do have a problem with is the misappropriation of the taxes that are taken. I m sure you all know what I m talking about or can instantly think of your own examples. In my field of work I get to see an outside view into gratuitous and on going wastes of tax payers money by the beneficiaries of the taxes accumulated. There is no check or balance to rectify or even for the tax payer to have visibility on how it is spent. In a well entrenched nation it is too complicated and the system far too convoluted to identify and rectify the lack of KPI s lack of repercussion and lack of visibility around the misappropriation of taxes to which the end result is the tax rates are always being re aligned usually as part of an increase which realistically is only needed to mask all of the above. Only a percentage of the taxes accumulated actually then transfer into visible improvements in services while the rest is eaten up bit by bit by the people in the system or on complete rubbish programs and outcomes. Most of which are just not needed andor HAVE to spend their annual grant else they get less tax revenue the next financial year. So as a result there is NO incentive in any dept or system that is dependent on your tax income to do ANYTHING more efficiently. I don t have a problem with taxes but I am a firm believer that everyone every single person in a well developed nation pays far far far too much tax for the services received. A percentage of it is used on meaningful outcomes. The rest is basically eaten up without any benefit to you or I. In this scenario a large percentage of what you and I pay IS legalised theft because we are paying extra to support a broken overtaxed system. Glad to hear we re entitled to 100 of our money that you earn on our behalf. this is incoherent babble we stopped allowing unpaid workers because of slavery. therefore if you work 20 hours and only get the money for 10 because of taxes that means you was a slave for 10 hours that week or day. if you re not getting the money for what you worked you are a slave and if slavery is illegal and working while not being paid is illegalwhich is why we have a minimum wage then taxation is illegal. Taxes only make sense on the grounds that we pay for public services. Why should a person pay more for the same services based on income? If a person who makes 40k annually and a person who makes 100k annually both hire a plumber to replace the same kind of toilet in similar conditions it would cost the same amount. Why should public services be any different? Second How can you say that someone is not entitled to the money they earn simply because there is infrastructure supporting them? The company takes a profit and pays taxes as well. If I earn 100000 annually at a dealership the owner makes more than four times that amount. How is that not fair compensation for the infrastructure supporting me? Taxes should be equal not in percentage but in actual dollar amounts. When Americans wake up and decide to take a stand maybe things will change but for now taxation is absolutely theft. Your argument can easily be used to argue that theft as in armed robbery is also morally pristine. It s not your money I get to decide whose it is . You should change the title. From why taxation isn t theft to why taxation IS theft but that s fine.  Now please excuse me. Your arguments were very convincing and I m off to rob a bank. Convince me not to! Taxation IS theft. Intellectual bullies just created another name for it. Clearly you have had too much government schooling. I m living in the wrong country. I hate it here. Greedy people. Also if yall hate taxes then promote Fairtax! Go educate yourselves read the facts. People don t get paid as a function of how hard they work or how skilled they are. You are confused. That is obviously related but it s not the real reason. People get paid as a result of engaging in economic contracts with other people where in a fair world both parties have agreed on a mutually satisfying transaction. If I am very highly skilled but I agreed to form a contract with a company that pays me less than others that s my choice and it s fair as long as the company didn t force me to participate in that contract. I may have done it because I like lowstress environments or because I didn t look for more or because I m a bad negotiator or because I didn t research the market or fill in the gap. There are a lot of good arguments happening in this comment thread and I m late to the party for sure but the point I didn t see anyone make seems to be the most obvious. You assert that taxes aren t theft because income is a gift and is not truly earned. So if I walk into your home and steal your families Christmas gifts on Christmas Eve I am not a thief? If I did this to an entire geographic region with a group of people helping me I am still not a thief? If I left the receipts so you and the rest of my victims know what you could have had am I no longer a thief? Where exactly is the line between theft and non theft then? Every bit of property I own was purchased with money I was gifted by the market or was gifted to me by someone close to me. Do I have no right to any of it despite the hours weeks years of labor I traded for the money used to buy it? You make it very clear that the idea of someone owning the fruits of their labor is not a valid argument but then you back that statement up with one of the most ridiculous arguments I ve ever heard. You re not a thief if you re stealing gifts. I think it s time we went and released and pardoned everyone who s been incarcerated for stealing because all of it was just a gift from the market anyway right? You re absolutely wrong. It s my money and I want it now!!!!! This writer is delusional!! His whole premise is that it is ok because people make more than what they earn and its also ok because others are taxed so it makes it fare. I pay federal taxes then I pay state taxes then I have to pay local municipal taxes. and most of the time they are all on the same things. That is double taxation by definition. Your argument is a circular argument that doesnt hold water. Right now I am paying taxes on my property that I already paid taxes on when I bought it. If I dont pay taxes every year the government can take it. My home is paid off but its still not mine if I dont pay the gov takes it away. I run a business. I have to pay a tax on all the items in my office desks chairs printers computers and vehicles all of which I have already paid taxes on. There is a tax on dying even. All the while the Public Servants are becoming millionaires off of our tax dollars. They are putting our tax dollars in places we dont want and getting kickbacks for doing it. They are routing it through other countries to fund wars that we mostly dont agree with all while getting kickbacks. The government is so crooked at this point that nothing they say can be believed. Even the IRS the branch of government in charge of tracking our money has lost TRILLIONS in unaccounted for money But they can go back 10 years and find out that I didnt pay the correct amount of tax one years. Its all corrumpt. Its all a money grab and power grab and starts with our current Commander and Theif and trickls down local municipalities. The problem is that it is so imbedded now that the only way to fix it is to burn it all down. I AM NOT ADVOCATED THAT NOT INSURECTIONS NOR WAR OR ANYTHING. What are the other options if we KNOW we are the victims of our governments great!?!? Utter nonsense. Morality has got nothing to do with it. It s not fair that X earns more than Y he works just as hard so the money should be redistributed . Who gets to decide? If you want X s money learn to do what X does. Oh you mean it s not just about hard work it s actually about skills knowledge and supply and demand. Your email address will not be published.
