June 24 2021 by Gracie Stockton Deescalation training for police can save lives but more than 20 states in the U.S. don t require it.  More than six years after a Ferguson Missouri police officer killed 18yearold Michael Brown sparking protests and a national conversation about police violence 21 states still don t require officers to receive ongoing training in techniques to reduce the use of force an APM Reports analysis has found.  Former President Barack Obama s 2015 Task Force on 21st Century Policing established in the aftermath of Brown s death called for all officers to receive deescalation training which teaches them ways to resolve confrontation without violence. And a growing number of states have heeded that call.  Before Brown s death in 2014 just eight states required officers to receive deescalation training. By the end of 2017 13 more states had added the training according to an analysis by APM Reports. In the past three years another eight states did so bringing the total to 29. The states that recently instituted deescalation training are Iowa Nebraska Nevada New Hampshire New York Pennsylvania Utah and Virginia.  Since Brown s death Americans have been regularly shocked by the violence committed by police officers resulting in the injury and death of a disproportionate number of people of color. Calls for reforms from banning the use of force to defunding the police often follow such incidents.  Experts in policing say deescalation can be particularly effective. A recent study in Louisville showed that officers who completed eight hours of deescalation training received 26 percent fewer citizen complaints reported 28 percent fewer useofforce incidents and logged 36 percent fewer injuries.  The killing of George Floyd last year by former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin who was convicted of murder in April sparked nationwide outrage and renewed calls for police reform. Minnesota mandates deescalation training enacting a requirement in July 2018 that officers take a 16hour training course every three years that includes deescalation mental health and conflict management. Minneapolis police records show Chauvin received a combined 47 hours of deescalation training in 2016 and 2018.  After Floyd s killing New Hampshire mandated that all police officers receive two hours of deescalation training each year as well as training in unconscious racial bias and ethics. Nebraska Utah and Virginia enacted deescalation policies for officers this spring.   We were directed by our governor to have very meaningful and in some cases passionate discussions relative to police accountability interactions with the community and police transparency said John Scippa director of the New Hampshire Police Standards and Training Council.  Most states have a board responsible for overseeing the licensing of police officers. Many of these state Peace Officer Standards and Training POST boards require officers to complete a certain amount of training to maintain their licenses typically including firearms driving CPR updated laws and use of force.  Many POST board members are local sheriffs and police chiefs and they tend to resist statewide mandates. Board leaders often say they prefer to let local agencies set their own training priorities and that communication skills taught in police academies are sufficient.  But that thinking may be starting to shift as board members and state lawmakers face public pressure from activists to enact stronger police reforms.  In 2017 the chair of Nevada s police licensing board opposed additional mandates insisting that deescalation was already covered in many agencies training. But two years later the state Legislature unanimously passed a requirement anyway. The new law mandates annual training on racial profiling mental health officer wellbeing racial bias and deescalation.   Training law enforcement officers is just as important as a doctor going to medical school or teachers receiving classroom management training or lawyers passing the bar exam Nevada Assembly Speaker and bill sponsor Jason Frierson said during a hearing. Giving officers the tools to deescalate a situation can often be the difference between life and death.  Subscribedocument.getElementByIdForm_Page_URL.value window.location.href

The topic has gained attention in recent years due to multiple highprofile events that involved great bodily harm or the use of deadly force. These events have reinforced the views of some who see peace officers as heavyhanded unreasonable and lacking empathy. Training in exposure to and participation in active deescalation can help dispel this and has numerous other benefits for officers agencies and citizens. By attempting deescalation tactics when viable peace officers may significantly reduce the need for the use of force. Law enforcement needs a concentrated effort where the focus on deescalation is paramount. The term deescalation refers to a wide range of strategies and tactics. The goal of deescalation is to reduce the likelihood of needing force or the amount of force required to resolve a potentially volatile situation. The following checklist of deescalation tactics and best practices can be applied to a variety of calls. 1. Responding peace officers should as soon as possible conduct a threat assessment of the event so as not to promote an unnecessary unreasonable or disproportionate use of force by placing themselves or others in undue jeopardy. This step is the starting point and is based on information relayed to and from dispatchers. Gathering further intelligence should be an ongoing process as police calls are often dynamic. Some of the critical questions officers ought to be asking are Responding officers should also seek information from others including dispatchers supervisors and other officers as well as agency computer networks that may contain valuable information related to persons addresses or previous calls for service. By asking these crucial questions officers will have a better idea about the nature of the call response needs and the possible pooling of additional resources. 2. Responding officers need to consider if the matter is policerelated with statutory considerations or if it is a civil matter and what other departments or personnel may need to be involved. It is also paramount that officers pay close attention to department policies related to handling certain calls for service relevant state statutes constitutional considerations and useofforce policies as well as agency deescalation expectations. Officers should be aware they may be held responsible under the premise of statecreated danger. Statecreated danger is a legal doctrine where officers can be held liable for injuries or deaths that occur because of a danger they created. 3. Using communication to gain voluntary compliance should be the goal. This voluntary compliance may be obtained by verbal persuasion and giving clear instructions. Individuals cannot be expected to comply with officers if they are being bombarded by numerous officers giving conflicting commands. Warnings given as a threat of force against an individual are not considered part of deescalation and should be avoided. 4. Treating individuals with equity and dignity to calm agitation and promote rational decisionmaking will promote deescalation. Responding officers should avoid using language that is insulting and taunting in nature which could lead to escalating the situation. 5. If an individual is simply not responding to officers it does not immediately mean force should or can be applied. There are many individuals who may lack the ability to hear or have an injury that contributes to their inability to respond to officers. Additionally individuals going through a mental health crisis may have lost the ability to communicate. Peace officers must also be aware that physical noncompliance does not automatically mean resistance. While taking in the totality of the circumstances officers should attempt to determine if an individual has physical limitations that may be affecting their ability to comply. Physical limitations could be an inability to speak hear walk or even move limbs. Awareness on scene may help eliminate confusion that can lead to unnecessary force being applied. 6. Time and distance are proven strategies that aid the officer as well as the involved party during a dynamic event. Additionally when there are more officers on scene to assist it is likely less force will be used. 7. Another important factor to consider is an officer s emotional intelligence. Officers who successfully manage their emotions and retain social skills will better be able to use deescalation as a viable tactic. Peace officers must also be able to show empathy which is the ability to consider other people s feelings especially when making decisions if they are genuinely attempting to use deescalation. The benefits of sound deescalation strategies are numerous Useofforce encounters involving great bodily harm or death have attracted widespread criticism of peace officer conduct. In the wake of that criticism more is expected of law enforcement agencies and individual officers alike. Although useofforce encounters are statistically rare more can be done to reduce conflict between peace officers and the communities they serve. New laws and conduct expectations are guiding the way many officers perform their duties. By training on and embracing sound deescalation tactics officers will be better able to protect themselves and serve their communities. Society and the law enforcement profession depend on it.

The purpose and focus of deescalation training is to improve the response of officers to incidents that involve persons in crisis who are behaving erratically emphasizing that public and officer safety are at the heart of this training process. Peace officers must understand how the principles of deescalation can provide effective tools during contacts with the Public and result in improved decisionmaking reduction in situational intensity and outcomes with greater voluntary compliance. The main learning objective of deescalation training is to provide police officers with an organized way of making decisions about how they will act in any situation including situations that may involve uses of force. Did you come to our website with questions about deescalation training? You re in the right place. Below you will find common questions that community members ask us about de escalation training tactics and requirements. This section is designed for the common man to understand what type of training police officers regularly go through. According to California P.O.S.T. Deescalation is the process of using strategies and techniques intended to decrease the intensity of the situation. Deescalation training is designed to help individuals learn how to effectively manage and respond to difficult situations. The goal of this type of training is to help individuals learn how to defuse tense situations while also maintaining their own safety and the safety of others. Deescalation training can be beneficial for a variety of professionals including law enforcement officers social workers and healthcare providers.  Deescalation training teaches officers to slow down create space and use communication techniques to defuse a potentially dangerous situation. Deescalation training provides officers with strategies to calmly deal with people who are experiencing mental and emotional crises. Tactical Deescalation involves the use of techniques to reduce the intensity of an encounter with a suspect and enable an officer to have additional options to gain voluntary compliance or mitigate the need to use a higher level of force while maintaining control of the situation.  There are a variety of deescalation techniques that can be employed in order to diffuse a tense or dangerous situation. Some examples of deescalation training techniques include  There are many deescalation techniques that can be used in order to reduce the intensity of a situation. Some of these techniques include  Active listening involves paying close attention to the other person in order to better understand their perspective. Body language can be used to defuse a situation by appearing nonthreatening and open. Verbal language should be calm and respectful in order to avoid escalating the situation. Successfully deescalating a situation is the result of a combination of communication empathy instinct and sound officer safety tactics. The philosophy behind the training is that officers need to take every opportunity to slow down a situation when possible. Apex Officer s deescalation training program includes ways to improve communication skills discussion of how to assess a subject s situation how to know when you need backup and proven officer safety tactics.  A number of studies have shown that citizens base their perceptions of police officers off their last encounter with an officer. By practicing proper deescalation techniques individual police officers will reduce their chances of being assaulted mitigate their risk of being sued and become more effective at their job. Police officers who develop proper deescalation skills and techniques apply them when appropriate and mitigate the need to use force will see improved job performance and increase their chances of being promoted. Deescalation training for police officers is becoming more common every year. Although police officers have gone through deescalation training in the past a number of states are mandating refresher and updated training for inservice officers. We created a full list of deescalation training requirements for police officers. The amount of time police officers are required to complete varies from state to state and police department to police department. According to a survey produced by PERF targeted police academies found that police cadets and recruits spent approximately eight hours on deescalation training. As far as inservice deescalation training the best source on this can be found in the Police Training Requirements guide found on this website. One of the most important aspects of any training simulation is the quality of the content. We work closely with state and federal governing agencies like the Department of Justice Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training POST and our police and law enforcement clients to ensure our training content is superior in quality realism immersion and relevance. We also employ subject matter experts to guide the development of our law enforcement systems and scenarios. With their help our worldclass team of software developers create intense realistic scenarios which are displayed using the best virtual reality technology.

Depending on whom you ask deescalation training is either a miracle cure or a fourletter word. As highprofile deadly confrontations between law enforcement officers and civilians continue to generate widespread public concern deescalation training has been hailed as the solution for this seemingly intractable problem. Public officials and policy makers from across the political spectrum have embraced deescalation training as the key to safer interactions between police and the public. But for some law enforcement officers deescalation is a loaded word. What they hear is Youre teaching me to hesitate and thats gonna get me killed said Robin Engel a professor of criminal justice at the University of Cincinnati. When we go in to implement this we have to call it something else. Engel a nationally respected criminologist has conducted years of research on deescalation training and its role in law enforcement. What she found early on surprised her Despite the conflicting claims and strong emotions very little was proven and consistent in deescalation training. There weren t many standards regarding what deescalation training should teach or how it should be implemented and absolutely no studies examining whether or not it worked. Engel whose work on deescalation training is supported in part by grants from the Bureau of Justice Assistance BJA set out to find answers. And while deescalation training is not a cureall it cant be applied in every situation a groundbreaking study by Engel found that deescalation training can dramatically reduce injuries among civilians and law enforcement officers alike. I was surprised and thrilled that we found a reduction in injuries Engel said in a recent interview. As a social scientist most of the studies we do don t find enough evidence to show anything. But in this case I was really surprised by the size of the finding. Engel first began focusing on deescalation training seven years ago when her career took an unexpected and highly unusual turn. Although she had spent her entire career in academia she was asked to take charge of the campus police department at the University of Cincinnati at a time of crisis. In July 2015 a University of Cincinnati campus police officer fatally shot a Black motorist named Samuel DuBose during a traffic stop. A public furor ensued and the officer who shot DuBose Ray Tensing was charged with murder. Two trials ended with hung juries and in 2017 the charges against Tensing were dropped. Shortly after the shooting the university president asked Engel to develop a plan to reform the campus police force. She was stunned when the president asked her to implement her proposed changes as head of the agency. I m a consultant Engel said. I had not been a police officer. But it was important that we get this right. So while continuing to serve on the University faculty she also began attending emotional public hearings and overseeing efforts to change campus police processes and procedures. One of the items high on her agenda was deescalation training. I wasnt going to ask our officers to do something unless we were confident in it Engel said. She was surprised by what she found and did not find. Although a variety of consultants were offering deescalation training to police departments their courses varied widely. There was no general agreement in law enforcement about what concepts should be included in deescalation training or how they should be taught. There was also no academic research on whether any variety of deescalation training actually protected the public. Engel soon discovered that many uniformed officers were skeptical of deescalation training because it contradicted some of the basic tenets they had learned. Patrol officers were taught to handle a situation quickly so it wouldn t get worse Engel said. Go in fast use the amount of force you need so things won t get out of control. By contrast deescalation training incorporates tactics that are employed by special operations units such as SWAT teams that take a very different approach to handling hostage situations and other potentially violent incidents. These officers were taught to use time distance and cover to their advantage Engel said. For patrol officers time was viewed as The more time you give a suspect the more danger youre in. Deescalation training teaches officers to think about use of force in different ways. Instead of Can I use force? the question becomes Should I use force? Robin Engel After she stepped down as head of the campus police force her work on deescalation training broadened in scope. She worked with several national law enforcement organizations who hammered out a model useofforce policy that is being implemented by agencies across the country. She also joined with the Louisville Kentucky police department to conduct a rigorous evaluation of deescalation training provided to officers. She was pleased to find that in Louisville deescalation training reduced useofforce incidents by 28 percent and citizen injuries by 26 percent. She was shocked to discover that officer injuries were reduced by an even larger margin 36 percent. There s a narrative out there a false narrative that if you engage in police reform you will be sacrificing public safety Engel said. At their very best police reform efforts reduce crime and make the public safer. These days Engel and her team from the University of Cincinnati are teaching deescalation training programs to several local law enforcement agencies in Oregon as part of a Crisis Response and Intervention Program that is sponsored by BJA grants. They are also working with the State of New Jersey which passed a law requiring all 550 of its local law enforcement agencies to report useofforce data and to implement deescalation training. Engel looks forward to analyzing the results. Were pushing this out into lots of places and theres a growing body of evidence that deescalation training if done properly can make a police officer s job safer Engel said. I hope that these findings will have an impact. Rather than have police executives say to officers You will do this deescalation training I hope we ll have officers demand that they get it.
https://www.policetechnews.com/post/how-the-law-enforcement-de-escalation-training-act-will-impact-police-officers, A summary of the deescalation training act and how it will impact your local police department. If you haven t heard on December 27 2022 the Law Enforcement DeEscalation Training Act became a public law. The Law Enforcement DeEscalation Training Act directs the Department of Justice DOJ to develop scenariobased training curricula or identify existing curricula that include topics such as alternatives to the use of force deescalation tactics and safely responding to an individual experiencing a mental behavioral health or suicidal crisis. According to Congress the term deescalation means taking action or communicating verbally or nonverbally during a potential force encounter in an attempt to stabilize the situation and reduce the immediacy of the threat so that more time options and resources can be called upon to resolve the situation without the use of force or with a reduction in the force necessary. The Law Enforcement DeEscalation Training Act was introduced in the Senate on April 5th 2022 by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse and Senator John Cornyn to to help law enforcement respond more effectively to people suffering mental or behavioral health crises. The senators bill would improve training for police officers interacting with individuals dealing with mental or behavioral health issues including using alternatives to force and deescalation tactics and working with mental health professionals on crisis intervention teams. It would also empower police and the mental health professionals working with them to link individuals to mental and behavioral health services in their community. 12142022Passedagreed to in House On passage Passed by the Yeas and Nays 264 162 Roll no. 525. 11292022Failed of passagenot agreed to in House On motion to suspend the rules and pass the bill Failed by the Yeas and Nays 23 required 247 160 1 Present Roll no. 486. 08012022Passedagreed to in Senate Passed Senate with an amendment by Unanimous Consent.text of amendment in the nature of a substitute CR S38323835 06142022Committee on the Judiciary. Reported by Senator Durbin with an amendment in the nature of a substitute. Without written report. In a statement released from the Executive Office of the President on December 13 2022 The Administration strongly supports House passage of S. 4003 the bipartisan Law Enforcement DeEscalation Training Act of 2022. This legislation would authorize 34 million over four years for the Department of Justice s Office of CommunityOriented Policing Services to support the establishment certification and implementation of training for law enforcement officers and mental health professionals on crisis intervention teams. This training would include 1 deescalation tactics and alternatives to the use of force 2 approaches to safely respond to people with disabilities or people in crisis 3 strategies for participating successfully on crisis intervention teams and 4 referrals to communitybased supportive services including housing public benefits and behavioral health. The legislation would further authorize 90 million over two years for the Department s Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program to support related training programs and continuing education for law enforcement and mental health professionals and to cover costs associated with participation in the National UseofForce Data Collection. Because advancing effective accountable policing builds public trust and strengthens public safety the Administration calls for swift passage of this commonsense bipartisan legislation. According to the Congressional Budget Office S. 4003 Law Enforcement DeEscalation Training Act would authorize the appropriation of 124 million over the 20232027 period to provide de escalation training for law enforcement personnel. CBO estimates that enacting S. 4003 would not affect direct spending or revenues. CBO estimates that implementing the legislation would cost 53 million over the 20232027 period any spending would be subject to the availability of appropriated funds. The legislation contains no intergovernmental or privatesector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act.  Too often police respond when someone is suffering a mental health or behavioral health issue yet lack the resources they need to do so effectively. We can save lives by equipping officers to recognize and respond appropriately to those situations to work with mental health professionals and connect people to treatment said Senator Whitehouse. I m pleased to join with Senator Cornyn on this important bill.   We ask law enforcement in our communities to wear too many hats including that of mental health provider and they often do not have enough resources or training to provide the level of care individuals in crisis need said Senator Cornyn. We must give them the necessary tools so officers feel supported while helping those experiencing mental health emergencies and other crises and this legislation would do just that.   Our law enforcement often has to make up for the deficiencies of our mental health system said Dr. Cassidy. Let s give law enforcement the tools and training they need for their safety and for those in the midst of a mental health crisis.   As the first ones on the scene America s law enforcement officers must be ready to respond to crises of all types. Equipping them with the necessary training and resources to ensure they can do their jobs and keep our communities safe is just plain common sense. I have been calling for this type of reform for years and I am glad to be a part of this bipartisan group working to finally make it happen said Senator Scott. The Law Enforcement DeEscalation Training Act would require the Department of Justice to work with experts to develop comprehensive trainings on deescalation tactics alternatives to use of force safely responding to mental behavioral and suicidal crises successfully participating on a crisis intervention team and making referrals to communitybased mental and behavioral health services and support and other social programs. The bill would also build off the existing Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant program to create a dedicated stream of funding for local and state law enforcement agencies to access these trainings and train their officers and the mental health professionals who work with them.

Suspects actions play a critical role in the escalation or deescalation of incidents. Through his analysis Borden sheds light on the unrealistic expectations placed on officers and the need for a more comprehensive understanding of deescalation among both law enforcement professionals and the community. Deescalation as a goal not a tactic Understanding deescalation as a goal allows for a more holistic approach to managing incidents involving a series of tactical decisions rather than a single prescriptive action. The role of suspect behavior The actions of individuals encountered by police significantly influence the potential for deescalation emphasizing that responsibility also lies with those being detained or apprehended. Realistic expectations and training There is a crucial need for realistic expectations regarding deescalation from both the community and law enforcement alongside targeted training that prepares officers for a variety of outcomes.

https://inpursuit.news21.com/stories/police-de-escalation-training-downsizes-use-of-force/, Video by Reagan CreamerNews21 Mikey Galo and Reagan CreamerNews21 INDIANAPOLIS Police in America are turning toward training and cultural changes to deescalate deadly encounters with police leaders lawmakers and activists enacting reforms in several U.S. cities. Researchers say police departments are conditioned to approach traffic violations mental health calls and other routine interactions in ways that keep officers safe but too often positions members of the public as potential threats. However according to University of Cincinnati researcher and criminologist Robin Engel evidence now exists that deescalation training can make police encounters with the public safer for all.  Adrenalinefueled encounters have led to tragedy often after traffic stops and mentalhealth calls. The Georgia State Patrol in April agreed to pay 4.8 million to the family of Julian Lewis who was shot to death in 2020 after a traffic stop and car chase. The Rev. David Greene preaches at the Purpose of Life Ministries in Indianapolis on Sunday July 10 2022. Those things didn t exist until recent years he says of recent police reforms. And it s because the community said Hey we need changes in this area. Photo by Mikey GaloNews21 The State Patrol had one hour of deescalation training in 2018 according to information it reported to Bureau of Justice Statistics data. Across the country the vast majority of police training academies have fewer than two hours of training according to an analysis of federal data from 2018 the latest available.  It certainly seems that this was an instance where the trooper lost his temper said Andrew Lampros an attorney representing the Lewis family who thinks deescalation training would have made a difference. Mr. Lewis was not a threat to anyone.  Researchers and advocates say proper deescalation training can reduce violent encounters between police and the public. But even as some experts cite deescalation as one of the most demanded police reforms there are challenges that limit its implementation on a national scale. Community activists say training won t prevent police killings and it needs to be matched by cultural changes from police city and state leaders. Standards for deescalation and what the term actually means also are unclear. Often it s dependent on leadership that may change and limited research into effectiveness. A perceived risk to officer safety also is a barrier to deescalation. Still as more police encounters in the U.S. turn deadly supporters say deescalation points toward an imperfect but necessary way to reform. In Indianapolis a coalition of police officials and community activists worked to expand deescalation training which now is among the most extensive in the country. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department provided 232 hours of deescalation training for its recruits in 2018 according to the Census for Law Enforcement Training Academies. On a wet Sunday in early July police recruits pulled over cars driven by field training officers with future officers placed under pressure and the watchful eyes of experienced officers as they navigated traffic stops. Some of the unscripted interactions were routine and cordial. But there also were highly volatile highstress situations that officers face routinely. Training officers for the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department call this daylong exercise Unknown Traffic Stop. Experienced officers hover nearby correcting behavior that could leave someone dead. You re talking to the driver beside the open front door of the car don t put him between you and the gun in the console. Don t interpret a frantic man waving his arms as a threat when he may be in a tough situation needing your help. And never forget to communicate with fellow officers on scene. Kevin Hershberger a field training officer called Unknown Traffic Stop realitybased training that mirrors the 99 of calls that do not require force.   When I came on scenariobased training was all about coming out and messing with recruits said Hershberger who started fieldtraining work 20 years ago. Every role player had guns on them and every role player had drugs all over them and stuff like that. Every scenario you went into was Bang bang you missed this gun. You re dead. It was never a winnable thing.  Two recruits in separate police cruisers stop a black Chevrolet Impala after it rolls through a stop sign. But when the recruits approach the sedan one on each side and introduce themselves to its two occupants they see a pistol resting in the center console. When the driver denies having a weapon the recruits tell the pair to keep their hands in plain sight and exit the vehicle. The recruits determine the pair are unlawfully carrying the weapon and arrest them. Text by Mikey GaloNews21  The driver leaves the car and a recruit pats him down next to the open front door.  So is this a quick pat down? a field training officer asks the recruit who stops and turns around.  You ve still got him between you and the gun the training officer says. Immediately the recruit grabs the driver by the arm and guides him to the back of the car. No violence occurs. When the recruits see the handgun they don t reach for their weapons but instead talk with the driver and passenger.  Keep your hands on the steering wheel one says. She looks to the other recruit on the passenger side who has already told the passenger to keep both hands on the frontseat grab handle. That recruit looks back at her and nods.  OK I m opening the door now she says as the driver exits. The recruit does the same with the passenger. No weapons are drawn. Catherine Cummings deputy police chief of training policy and oversight said Indianapolis has made a number of changes since 2020 including converting its firearms board into a civilianled useofforce board and adopting a newer training model for deescalation. Deescalation is built into the department s DNA Cummings said.  We were already very steeped in deescalation training prior to 2020 she said. And so we just looked at what is out there what additional training we can add to what we re already doing just make sure that our training is keeping up with current demands and what is considered best practice across the country.  The department which also is involved in a research project at the University of Cincinnati started training veteran officers this year and will continue next year Cummings said.  Any time that we feel that we need to do kind of a refresher in inservice training for veteran officers we will do that as well she added.  The fact that your tone your physical presence your facial expressions all of that matters when you re talking about deescalation she said. We re teaching them to do something that they do with their own families and their own friends and their own neighbors every single day.  A police recruit stops the black Chevrolet which has swerved across the center line. The recruit believes the driver who exited the sedan as soon as it stopped and refused orders to return could be a threat so he waits for a second recruit to arrive. Once he does the pair meet the driver and his two passengers who have mental health conditions that prevent them from communicating. Relying only on the driver s word the recruits learn that he s a care worker and had driven his clients to the grocery store. On the way back the driver says the frontseat passenger had lunged at the steering wheel. Text by Mikey GaloNews21  The recruits initially mistake a mental health crisis for a drunken driving incident. There are reasons for the misunderstanding the driver is excited and refuses to get back in the car. Once they greet the sedan s passengers they start to assess what s really happening. Before the recruit in the lead car leaves his vehicle the sedan s driver jumps out holding a black object in his left hand. He waves his arms and shouts at the recruit who gets out of his car but doesn t understand what the driver is saying. The recruit stays behind the open patrol car door. He can see there are other people in the sedan but his eyes watch the driver s left hand.  Stop. Stop and get back in your vehicle.  The driver shouts more and takes three steps forward. The recruit rests his right hand on his holstered service pistol.  Stop where you are and get back in your vehicle the recruit says his voice louder now. The driver takes another step forward then stops and lowers his arms to his sides. It s evident that the object in his left hand is a phone.  I m sorry I m sorry. I just need help over here.  The driver walks back to the sedan. The recruit removes his hand from his gun which remains holstered. The recruits with patience calm the driver and his passengers. Twenty minutes after the traffic stop they leave for home.

Text and photo by Mikey GaloNews21 DeAndra Yates a gun violence activist who now works for the Indianapolis police department s NonFatal Shootings Advocacy and Support Program said all the recent reforms started with the public.  The community is being impacted right? So why not allow them to have a seat at the table and a voice in that space? Yates said. The Rev. David Greene senior pastor of Purpose of Life Ministries Church also credited community activism for the creation of the police department s civilianled useofforce board and a mental health team that accompanies officers to calls during the work week.  Those things didn t exist until recent years he said. And it s because the community said Hey we need changes in this area.

Photo by Mikey GaloNews21 Indianapolis police incorporate deescalation training from the Police Executive Research Forum an organization focused on best practices in policing. Its program known by its acronym ICAT emphasizes that useofforce training needs to move beyond just being taught in police academies to integration into ongoing training for veteran officers. Tom Wilson director of the forum s Center for Management and Technical Assistance said the program emphasizes a continuous holistic approach when teaching officers how to reason through situations and communicate with the people they encounter.  Over the course of the last few years law enforcement leaders have recognized Hey this is important stuff Wilson said. And this is really stuff that we ve been talking about in policing for years. It s just getting back to some really good common sense policing.  As of 2021 Wilson said about 700 departments had received at least parts of ICAT training. How many training hours a department receives through different methods and programs varies widely. The San Antonio Police Department provided 80 hours of deescalation training in 2018 according to selfreported data in the census of police training academies. The Philadelphia Police Department reported five hours. The Georgia patrol had the lowest reported at one hour. In addition competing approaches to deescalation training complicate the landscape and make it difficult to determine what methods are effective.  We don t know how that particular training impacts a wide array of agencies across different communities different socioeconomic statuses population sizes and things like that said Morgan Steele a national research coordinator for the National DeEscalation Training Center in Detroit. Still researchers have started making some analyses. In a study earlier this year Engel the University of Cincinnati researcher wrote that data from the Louisville Metro Police Department in Kentucky showed significant reductions after the ICAT deescalation training 28 in useofforce incidents 26 fewer citizen injuries 36 fewer officers injuries. Departments should continue to implement and evaluate deescalation trainings and adopt other resiliencybased approaches to police training the study says. To facilitate longterm changes in police behavior a holistic approach is recommended that supports training tenets with complementary policies supervisory oversight managerial support and community involvement in reform efforts.  In a 2020 study on police reforms Engel wrote that departments have been slow to incorporate deescalation training as newer models run counter to more traditional methods that encourage quick decisionmaking and bring up department fears that deescalation puts officers in greater danger.  Concerns regarding officer safety run deep within police organizational cultures Engel s study says and some trainers have resorted to avoiding the use of the word deescalation altogether in training sessions rather describing these techniques as opportunities to defuse situations.  But some acknowledge that reform can t depend on research. Explore the methodology of a federal survey of 770 training academies.  Policing can t wait said William Terrill who served on President Barack Obama s Task Force on 21st Century Policing. It can t wait right? You can t wait for 10 years of research and say Well we re going to hold up and wait until the final evidence is in 10 years from now.  Terrill who holds a doctorate in criminal justice said police often escalate situations that otherwise were benign. He recently analyzed more than 500 videos from body cameras worn by officers in two Texas police departments.  About 1 out of every 5 times 21 of the time officers took a completely compliant situation where the suspect is complying with everything and the officers actually escalated it through their behavior he said. They used force on a compliant suspect.  Terrill said it s also about changing the culture of how police serve the public every day. When department leaders reviewed his finding that their organizational culture encouraged traffic stops pat downs and searches they called that good policing he said.  You re getting a situation where you re creating from a community perspective what is low level but still force Terrill said. Cause we re not talking about deadly force right? But from a scientist s perspective I worry about the legitimacy and the cumulative effect that has on a particular community that s constantly getting stopped searched patted down and you know only having something found 1 out of 10 times.  Three recruits stop a black Chevrolet with three occupants. One approaches on the drivers side while the others approach the passenger side in single file. Once the recruits introduce themselves and run background checks they learn that a passenger has a warrant for his arrest. When the lead recruit pulls the wanted man from the car he sees the suspect was sitting on a bag of cocaine a bag of marijuana and a fake driver s license. The recruit alerts the others and all three passengers are removed from the car so it can be searched. Text by Mikey GaloNews21  Miscommunication. This is the lead recruit s first traffic stop. He forgets that as the primary officer he s supposed to direct the other two recruits. That lack of communication could mean a stop going wrong and escalating into something bad.  Where do you want me? one asks the lead.  Ready over here the third recruit says. The lead recruit stops. He has already introduced himself to the car s driver but he loses his place. His training officer steps in but not before he lets the recruit struggle for a few seconds.  This is your show he says. You re the primary officer. You re directing this.   OK the recruit says. OK there are three people in the car. You re over here. Let s try again.  Clear communication in other ways. When a recruit pulls the wanted man from the car drugs are visible. The recruit handcuffs him.  Before you move do you see anything? his training officer asks him.  OK so make that known the trainer advises. The people in the car know that s there. But you need to relay that to your beat partners because we don t know what your beat partners can see. Your beat partner behind you is definitely not going to be able to see. So just say Hey there s dope in the front seat. Make sure they don t grab it. And then go about your business.   Do you see the dope in the front seat? he asks the recruit on the driver s side.  Do you see the dope? he asks the recruit behind him.  It s right here in front of me. Make sure nobody moves it.  The recruit then walks the suspect to the back of the Chevrolet. Even hardwon reforms don t provide a guarantee. Greene the Indianapolis pastor said more can be done. He pointed to the recent death of Herman Whitfield III 39 of Indianapolis who died in the custody of police who had been called to his parents home for a mental health crisis. Police Tased and restrained Whitfield before he died in April according to media accounts.  That escalated a situation that could have been easily in my opinion deescalated Greene said. The autopsy report released by the Marion County Coroner s Office listed Whitfield s cause of death as cardiopulmonary arrest in the setting of law enforcement subdual prone restraint and conducted electrical weapon use. Morbid obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease were listed as contributing conditions. Indianapolis police say a criminal investigation into Whitfield s death is ongoing. Greene said officers escalated the situation which may make people hesitant to call the police for help in an emergency.  Do you think that those parents are going to call 911 next time and say OK police I need you? They re less likely to do that. People who are familiar with their situation are less likely to do that because of what happened to a young man who was completely naked.  Activists also are concerned about a new Indiana law that requires a statewide review board to establish new standards for training including in deescalation. Activists fear that will mean fewer hours for officer training. Josh Riddick checks his phone outside the Faith in Indiana office Indianapolis. He fears a new law empowering a statewide review board to establish training standards will mean fewer training hours on such subjects as deescalation. Photo by Reagan CreamerNews21 Josh Riddick an organizer with the civil rights organization Faith in Indiana expressed his frustration. Legislators he said didn t take into account the work the largest police force in the state has done to make sure it is doing right by the community. So again that inability to listen and consider such a large population base such a large law enforcement group is frustrating.  Cummings the deputy chief of training said it s purely speculative to say the law will lead to fewer training hours. The future for deescalation training in police departments is mixed. Angela Harrelson George Floyd s aunt said the key is officers who are embedded in a community. How tragedies in traffic stops lead to reforms across the country  When you know your community you can deescalate a situation better than someone that doesn t Harrelson said. They can say Oh there s soandso there you know I know him. I know his parents let me talk to him.  Greene said the key is trust in a partnership of police and the public.  I don t think either side wins without the other Greene said. And I want to be clear about that. The police department will not win without the community and the community is not going to win without the police department. We have to have that bridge.   My experience over many years is that most agencies want to get better he said. They want to do good. They just disagree about what good is sometimes or what the proper pathway for that is. But they re open to it.  News21 reporter Piper Vaughn contributed to this article. Mikey Galo is Inasmuch Foundation Fellow. Reagan Creamer is Hearst Foundation Fellow.

Across the country members of the public are asking elected officials police executives and city and county leaders to reimagine the roles and functions of policing public safety and public trust.  The Philadelphia Police Department PPD has developed a holistic approach to encourage deescalation and reduce use of force and thereby to restore public trust. This holistic approach provides deescalation training and resources as well as recognition to officers for exemplary tactics in deescalation.  In 2007 the PPD began offering crisis intervention training CIT to officers who then became designated crisis intervention officers. As the PPD has continued to invest in and develop strategies that allow officers to respond safely and effectively to those in crisis the department has expanded CIT and now offers a modified curriculum for all officers as well as for dispatchers.  Dispatchers are also provided with a mental health script to help them deal effectively with crisis calls. This not only enables them to provide critical information to officers so that they know what kind of situation awaits them but also offers dispatchers themselves strategies for deescalating a crisis before the police get there.  CIT for 911 dispatchers began in November 2020 and has been completed by approximately 65 percent of Philadelphia 911 dispatchers. In addition to this training service options have increased through the introduction of the coresponder program. Select CIT officers and civilian behavior health clinicians undergo an additional 80hour program that largely comprises realitybased scenarios so that these individuals can learn how to handle persons in crises as a team. All members of the PPD s Reality Based Training Unit have also received CIT training for the purpose of being able to create specialized reality scenarios to ensure their coresponding teams are fully prepared prior to hitting the streets. This work is coordinated by the PPD with their partners at the Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual Disability Services DBHIDS.  The PPD s commitment to serving those in crisis is shown through the number of officers who continue to be trained and prepared for responding to such incidents. Since 2007 approximately 3500 Philadelphia police officers have undergone the PPD s CIT training as have more than 275 officers from surrounding jurisdictions. To meet increased demand for the training the PPD has added additional classes every year.  A central aspect of this approach has been the renewed focus on deescalation training for police officers.  The RealityBased Training Unit has developed and delivered training focused on the core principles of deescalation crisis communication and tactics. RealityBased Training scenarios include situations in which officers intervene in use of excessive force crisis intervention and commandcontrol situations. Realitybased training is refreshed annually with new scenarios added regularly to keep up with evolving case law local ordinances and lessons learned from significant events. The development of the deescalation training program takes into account national research and training concepts such as the ICAT Critical DecisionMaking Model. During this training officers learn to use time and distance to deescalate situations without creating risk to civilians or fellow officers.  Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw elevated the priority of this training under her crime reduction action plan and believes that departmentwide recognition of officers who have successfully deescalated situations using these training techniques is critical to their adoption by all members of the PPD.  To recognize the accomplishments of these officers thereby reinforcing and incentivizing the use of deescalation tactics and CIT training the PPD awards the Medal of Tactical Deescalation.  This medal was created in 2015 when then Commissioner Charles Ramsey worked with the PPD executive team to create it in response to a recommendation from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services report on the PPD. The practice of rewarding the effective use of deescalation tactics with a medal has also recently been advocated for by the Council on Criminal Justice s policy assessment on deescalation policies and training. To date the PPD Medal of Tactical Deescalation has been awarded to 138 officers who managed to preserve life in dangerous and difficult circumstances.  One of these acts involved two officers who used lessthanlethal methods to restrain a woman with a knife who had stated that she would kill anyone who got in the way of her planned suicide. Another award was issued to an officer who knowing that the subject was a veteran suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder disarmed a man who had a loaded revolver and provided assistance by transporting him for mental health care.  These heroic acts as well as the daytoday professionalism and dedication of the PPD s 6600 sworn members and 800 civilian personnel are a source of pride to Commissioner Outlaw who says Despite the challenges of conducting training under COVID restrictions our department has had sizeable growth in numbers of Crisis Intervention Trained officers. There has also been substantial growth in our partnership with DBHIDS to better serve the needs of Philadelphians who suffer from mental health and behavioral health related crises. Going forward we will continue to focus on implementing equitable strategies especially those that are laserfocused on the goal of rebuilding a foundation of trust and relationships in the neighborhoods we serve.  In April 2020 Officer Ne Keea Halsey and her partner responded to a 911 call stating that a man was threatening to kill another man as well as himself. At the scene the officers observed a man bleeding from a cut and standing next to a knife on the ground. As the officers approached he produced a second knife and putting it to his neck stated Just shoot me this is not working. The officers pleaded with the man to put down the knife and when he refused Officer Halsey stated that she would deploy her Taser. The man then dropped the knife but produced a bottle of pills which he threatened to swallow.  Officer Halsey kept the man distracted from his threat of selfharm by engaging him in a conversation while her partner removed the pill bottle. The potentially deadly ordeal ended with the officers taking the man to an area hospital for emergency care and a mental health evaluation. In June 2020 Officer Andrew Haenchen responded to a call stating that a person was armed with a firearm. On the scene the officer was told that the subject was under the influence of PCP and had been walking around his house with a rifle. At the front door Haenchen tried to speak with the subject while alerting his supervisor who declared a barricade situation. Approximately 30 minutes later the subject came out of the house peacefully and spoke to Officer Haenchen. The police then recovered an AR15 rifle loaded with 29 live rounds as well as a crossbow from the house. The subject was then taken to a hospital for a mental health commitment. Acknowledgement for outstanding acts of service such as Officer Halsey s and Officer Haenchen s lifesaving efforts is an important way for the PPD to recognize those who have put themselves in harm s way in the service of others. The PPD s Medal of Tactical Deescalation recognizes the very best in policing and presents it as a model for others to emulate. Faye C.
