But over time gun control laws have placed limits on that freedom. Some politicians and gun control proponents argue that these laws are necessary even at the cost of infringing upon a fundamental American right. But the fact is gun control doesn t work the way advocates argue it does. Gun control is an umbrella term that refers to laws and ordinances that restrict how lawabiding citizens can buy own or use firearms. These vary at the federal state and local levels. This means that while the Second Amendment protects your Right to Keep and Bear Arms there may be different restrictions placed upon that right depending on where you live. Gun control at the local level ranges widely. For example in some towns citizens who are licensed to carry concealed firearms cannot do so in public parks. And in Chicago it s unlawful to own most semiautomatic firearms. Federal gun control legislation like the Gun Control Act of 1968and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act 1993 created nationwide requirements that make it more difficult to obtain a firearm. These laws have been in place for decades and by now the evidence is crystal clear. Gun control doesn t work. Some of the key reasons are detailed below. Criminals Don t Obey Gun Control Laws Criminals by definition do not obey the law. Gun control laws only affect lawabiding people who go through legal avenues to obtain firearms. Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws. That s why background checks have virtually no impact on criminals. A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes and the results weren t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1 obtained their firearms through a retail source.  The vast majority of criminals obtained their firearms through other means including 1 Criminals who go through illegal avenues to obtain firearms arent going to submit to background checks while doing so. Ultimately only lawabiding citizens would be impacted by expanded background checks. Background Checks Aren t Effective Even if criminals did submit to background checks we ve seen that these checks aren t effective at stopping those who intend to use guns to commit crimes. A person with no criminal history walks into a store to buy a gun they ll use to commit a crime. A background check most likely won t stop them. A drug addict lies about their addiction on a federal background check form. Although this individual is committing a federal crime a background check most likely won t stop them. A person with serious mental health issues but no history of treatment or institutionalization goes to buy a gun. A background check most likely won t stop them. It makes sense then that background checks have no impact on violent crime. Just take a look at California a state that s had background checks in place for decades. In 2018 a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades 19812000 of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California. 2 Again and again firearm background checks have proven to be ineffective. What we do know is that they simply make the gun buying process more difficult for lawabiding citizens.  On the other hand allowing lawabiding citizens to more easily access firearms does help reduce violent crime. Gun control advocates have long promoted the idea that making firearms more accessible would increase crime. But time has told a different story. Gun ownership is up and violent crime is down overall. Let s look over some quick facts It makes sense that criminals would be far less likely to commit a crime if they believed their victim might be armed. In fact a major study of 2000 felons in state and federal prisons across the United States showed that criminals actually fear armed citizens more than they fear the police. 8  Cities with the Strictest Gun Control Have the Highest Crime Rates Does gun control reduce crime? The evidence says no.  In fact cities with some of the most stringent gun laws like New York and Chicago suffer from some of the highest violent crime rates. Shooting and murder rates in Chicago surged 50 in 2020 and that city recorded the highest number of gunrelated homicides on record. 9 Guncontrolled Chicago became the most murderous city in the country.  New York City saw similarly alarming statistics. In 2020 homicides increased 41 and shootings increased an astounding 95. 10 Studies have shown that homicide rates tend to rise when lawabiding citizens are unable to own and carry firearms for selfdefense. 11 And the recent statistics from some of the country s most antigun cities confirm this conclusion. The simplest solution is crime control enforcing existing laws aimed at criminals who carry and use firearms to commit their crimes. We know that homicides in cities trend down when elected officials encourage solid police work and harsh penalties for gun criminals. We ve seen it work in past years in Chicago when the city gave additional resources to law enforcement. We ve known for decades that crime control works. A good example is Project Exile a program launched in Richmond Virginia in 1997. Faced with a skyhigh homicide rate Richmond prosecutors began enforcing existing gun laws to the fullest imposing lengthy sentences against drug dealers and other criminals who were carrying firearms illegally.  The project was an enormous success. Law enforcement took hundreds of illegal guns off the street and Richmonds homicide rate plummeted. 12 Other cities implemented the program with similar success.  In short Project Exile demonstrated beyond a doubt that focusing on gun criminals not placing undue burden on lawabiding citizens is the best way to curb violent crime and make the American people safe.

https://www.britannica.com/story/gun-control-in-the-us,  Gun control refers to any legal measure intended to prevent or restrict the possession or use of guns particularly firearms. In a broader historical sense the term also refers to legal limits on the possession or use of other arms including those that predate the invention of gunpowder. In most developed countries gun control is strict and uncontroversial. In others it is a fraught political issue pitting those who regard it as necessary for public safety against those who view it as a dangerous infringement of personal liberty. Nowhere in the world is gun control more controversial than in the United States where gun possession is constitutionally protected but where murders including mass murders committed with guns are extremely common the United States has by far the highest homicidebyfirearm rate among developed countries. Proponents of increased gun control in the United States argue that limiting access to guns will save lives and reduce crime opponents insist that it would actually do the opposite by preventing lawabiding citizens from defending themselves against armed criminals. The guncontrol debate in the United States also necessarily concerns the proper interpretation of the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution which reads A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. In keeping with the first clause of the amendment the preamble most U.S. courts until the early 21st century had understood it to guarantee the right of states to maintain militias or the right of individuals to keep and bear arms in connection with their service in a state militia an interpretation that was consistent with a wide variety of existing restrictions on individual gun ownership and use. In United States v. Miller 1939 for example the U.S. Supreme Court held that the Second Amendment did not prohibit laws requiring the registration of sawedoff shotguns because such weapons did not have a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia. In District of Columbia v. Heller 2008 however the Supreme Court for the first time explicitly recognized an individual right to use firearms independent of service in a state militia for traditionally lawful purposes including selfdefense within the home. Two years later the court held in McDonald v. Chicago that this interpretation of the amendment was applicable against state and local guncontrol laws as well as against federal statutes. In the United States mass murders committed with guns are so frequent that the vast majority of them are not even mentioned in mainstream media outlets. Those that happen to be massive or heinous enough to gain national attention including the murder of 49 people in an Orlando nightclub in 2016 and the massacre of 20 children and six adults at an elementary school in Newtown Connecticut in 2012 typically spark a shortlived and fruitless debate about the need for stricter gun control. Politicians of both major parties fearful of retaliation from the National Rifle Association NRA solemnly offer their thoughts and prayers while refusing to enact reasonable and constitutional measures now favored by a majority of Americans such as expanded background checks for gun purchases and the reinstatement of a federal ban on assault weapons which Congress allowed to lapse in 2004.
https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/most-young-americans-feel-unsafe-and-support-stricter-gun-laws-new-survey-shows,  Sam Lane Sam Lane  A new survey of people between the ages of 14 and 30 is believed to be the first of its kind to explore young Americans attitudes on guns. It comes as gun violence has killed more than 24000 people in the U.S. this year. Cynthia Miller Idriss of American Universitys Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab joined Laura Barr nL pez to discuss the results of the study. Notice Transcripts are machine and human generated and lightly edited for accuracy. They may contain errors. Gun violence has killed more than 24000 people in the U.S. this year including over 1000 people under the age of 18. Laura Barr nL pez looks at a report that researchers say is the first of its kind to explore young Americans attitudes about guns. The study surveyed more than 4100 people between the ages of 14 and 30. Among the key findings four out of five say gun violence is a problem in the U.S. and a majority support stricter gun laws. On average youth know at least one person whos been injured or killed by a gun and more than 40 percent of those surveyed have at least somewhat easy access to a gun. The report first provided to the NewsHour was published jointly by Everytown for Gun Safety the Southern Poverty Law Center and American Universitys Polarization and Extremism Research and Innovation Lab. That lab is directed by Cynthia MillerIdriss joins me now to talk about the study. What prompted your team to study these issues? And what surprised you the most about the findings? Cynthia MillerIdriss American University Well we have been studying these issues related to extremism for several years extremist violence terrorist violence. And one of the things you see in the global data is that the U.S. has a disproportionate share of violent deaths by terrorism and extremism more than about half the incidents and about half the lethality in the global data. And thats probably connected to guns we thought. So why do we have so many firearms? How does that relate to extremist violence? Was our original set of interests in this? And so we really wanted to see how do you address these two issues together? What can we find out by assessing some of the data and serving young people? What most surprised me was how many young people already have access to a firearm very easy access or somewhat easy access to a firearm. Those numbers are strikingly high some 40 percent as you just noted and then another 17 percent said that they plan to have access to a firearm pretty soon in the next few years so when theyre old enough or when they have the money to do it. So we found that I found that to be very troubling data. And in the study dives into youth perceptions of safety as it relates to guns. What did you find there? Well one of the things we found about young people is that they feel unsafe so they do not feel safe at school. They do not feel safe in public. Essentially outside their home in other public spaces they have concerns about their safety. And thats also correlating we found with feelings of anxiety depression and PTSD 25 percent of them have been in an active shooter lockdown not a drill an actual lockdown. And so when we think about a generation that is hypervigilant essentially about the possibility of gun violence erupting sort of at any moment around them parents are scared to send their kids to school kids are scared about going to school and about other public spaces where they spend time. And thats a really sad fact to assess in their feelings about firearms and their safety. You also found that many young people see gun culture as part of their identity. Can you explain that a bit more? Yes people some of the young people in the study were very connected to a sense of gun culture to feeling like guns made them stronger or better or that they were really connected to who they are as individuals. And I think Americans maybe have become accustomed to that but thats pretty unique compared to other countries our neighbors and our allies overseas who dont have that same kind of connection between a sense of who you are especially as a young man lets say and owning a gun or feeling like thats essential and connected to your identity. So thats an important part of understanding for our communities as well. Now this study was about gun views on guns and gun violence. But your team also explored connections between gun culture and issues like racism and male supremacy. People surveyed were asked if they agreed with statements like women cannot help but be attracted to those who are higher in status than they are. Why track those ideas? And what correlations did you find about those views and the ones that they had on guns? Yes that part of the data was also very troubling and very revealing although not as surprising to me. So what we found is that youth who have easier access to guns who are more committed to a kind of gun culture also have higher scores on racial resentment and male supremacist ideas which are the kinds of ideas that you just mentioned. What that tells us as prevention experts is that you cant address these issues on their own. You have to address issues of hostility or misogyny or racism toward others at the same time as youre addressing issues of gun prevention. You cant do this in isolation from each other. And how did participants views on race in particular impact their attitudes about guns? We found on the one hand theres a correlation between their views about whether they their access to guns their views about gun culture or their views about the Second Amendment and having higher scores on racial resentment so meaning they hold stronger racist views. But we also found in focus groups that we did later that their perceptions of safety are highly racialized right? They have a feeling that the places that are less safe theyre places with more racial diversity than the ones that they live in their communities. So this is a problem for many of them of over there violence rather than thinking its going to hit their own community particularly for white respondents. Another data point that stood out to me was that 22 percent of those surveyed said they believe the Second Amendment gives individuals the right to overthrow the government. The study concludes that society must target supremacist and antidemocratic ideologies among this population that you surveyed that justify and rationalize the use of violence and the deployment of guns to facilitate that violence. How do you do that? So one of the things we found in this data is that young people just like older adults are easily persuaded by false information that they encounter online persuasive manipulative rhetoric that they might encounter about why they need a gun who theyre keeping themselves safe from including they think from the government in some cases. And that actually is pretty easy to address believe it or not. When youre when youre dealing with an issue of somebody being manipulated by content they encounter online we can prebunk that with video content with content that they review in advance and read. We can teach people to be more skeptical of the content they review online they encounter to be more digitally literate. It just has to be done early and often. Its a part of basic strengthening of democratic resilience and not just a catchup afterward. Cynthia MillerIdriss of American University thank you so much.

Gun rights activists in Texas where it s legal to carry guns openly in most public places Last month a gunman opened fire in the baggage claim of the airport in Fort Lauderdale Florida. The shooter was later identified as an Army veteran who had sought help for mental illness. He killed five people. The deadly shooting reignited a longstanding debate about firearms in the United States. The U.S. has more guns and gun deaths than any other developed country.  As firearms have become more powerful and mass shootings fill the news arguments over gun laws have grown more heated. Some people say that we need stricter laws to limit the kinds of guns that are legal to own and make it harder for criminals to get weapons. These kinds of restrictions are known as gun control.  Opponents of such measures say that most guncontrol laws violate the right to bear arms that the Framers laid out in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that this amendment protects a person s right to keep a loaded firearm for selfdefense.  Congress hasn t passed major guncontrol legislation in two decades. President Donald Trump has said he would oppose any new guncontrol measures. He favors expanding gun owners rights. Does the U.S. need tougher guncontrol laws? Two experts weigh in. We lose more than 36000 Americans to gun violence every year in this country. That s an average of 99 gun deaths a day. These tragedies range from accidents and suicides to horrific mass shootings like the one at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando Florida last June.  No other democracy in the world experiences this level of gun violence. That s because other free nations have tough gun laws to deal with this problem.  It s estimated that Americans own more than 300 million guns. Guns certainly do not cause crime but the fact that they are so easily available does make crimes more deadly. Simply put when more people have guns the odds go up that those guns will be used.  We lose more than 36000 Americans to gun violence every year. We re all tired of reading stories about shooters who passed background checks and legally purchased firearms despite histories of violent behavior severe mental illness and substance abuse. And that s when background checks are required. A new survey found that 22 percent of gun owners recently bought a firearm through a private sale. Such sales do not require a background check and are legal in more than 30 states. That gives dangerous people a free pass to arm themselves. We need tougher gun laws across the board but a logical place to start is with the enactment of a federal law requiring background checks on all gun sales. Those checks should also be strengthened to block all those with a history of violence.  The United States is known for accomplishing extraordinary things. Never let anyone tell you that we can t save the lives we re losing to gun violence. We can and we must.  Ladd EverittDirector One Pulse for America a gun violence prevention group On July 24 2014 a doctor used his concealed handgun to disable a gunman who had begun firing in a hospital in Darby Pennsylvania. One hospital worker had been killed. Police said that if the doctor had not been armed many more innocent people would have died.  As for the gunman not only did he ignore the hospital s no weapons policy he had both a mental and a criminal record that disqualified him from possessing firearms under federal law.  And that is precisely the problem Gun control has consistently failed to keep bad guys from getting firearms. Guncontrol advocates claim that we just need tougher laws. But with thousands of pages of failed gun laws already on the books it s highly unrealistic to think that enacting more restrictions will work any better.  People are using guns to save a life more often than to take a life. In 2003 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC examined dozens of gun and ammunition bans waiting periods and background checks. After analyzing all these restrictions the CDC concluded that the evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of any of these guncontrol laws.  The CDC examined the issue again in 2013 and reported that there are between 500000 and  3 million annual cases of guns being used for selfdefense. This means that people are using guns to save a life 16 to 100 times more often than to take a life. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled on the right to keep and bear arms which is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. The Court correctly noted that this right belongs to all Americans. We should reject additional restrictions on this important right.  Erich PrattExecutive Director Gun Owners of America CORE QUESTION What evidence does each writer use to support his claim?

Aug 23 2022  Twentyone percent of Americans say either themselves a family member or a close friend has had an experience with gun violence in the past five years and twice as many believe it is likely they will be a victim of gun violence in the next five years according to a new study from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy and The Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research. There are significant racial and ethnic disparities in experiences with gun violence. Black Americans and Hispanic Americans are more than twice as likely as white Americans to say either themselves or someone they know has experienced gun violence 54 and 27 vs. 13. Looking ahead to the next five years about 4 in 10 Americans think it is at least somewhat likely that they will personally be a victim of gun violence including nearly 1 in 10 who believe it is extremely or very likely. 71 of Americans say gun laws should be stricter.  The poll highlights that gun violence has touched the lives of many Americans especially Black and Hispanic Americans and there is significant public concern about this said Jens Ludwig a professor at the Harris School of Public Policy. Despite the polarizing climate surrounding these issues the poll also reveals strong public support for policies to prevent gun violence which may help to foster increased consensus among policymakers to further act.  Threefourths of Americans view gun violence as a major problem and 8 in 10 say gun violence is on the rise in the United States. Fewer believe it is increasing in their state 66 or local community 39. Those living in urban areas 51 are more likely to believe that gun violence is on the rise in their communities than those living in suburbs 39 and rural communities 27. Many Americans want to both prevent gun violence and protect gun rights. Fiftytwo percent say it is both very important to prevent mass shootings and very important to ensure people are able to own guns for personal protection. There is broad public support for a variety of gun control policies and 71 of Americans say gun laws should be stricter. Majorities favor both policies to restrict who can buy guns and policies banning certain guns but the most popular regulations are those that limit who can purchase guns. For example 85 support a federal law preventing mentally ill people from purchasing guns compared to 59 who support a nationwide ban on semiautomatic weapons.  The American public is more supportive of policies limiting who can purchase guns than policies banning the sale of certain types of guns said David Sterrett senior research scientist with The APNORC Center. The findings also highlight that about half of Americans have intersecting priorities with gun policies and they don t see a direct conflict between protecting gun ownership and implementing policies to prevent gun violence.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/513623/majority-continues-favor-stricter-gun-laws.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Gallup s latest update on Americans opinions on gun laws finds a majority continuing to favor strengthening those laws. Fiftysix percent of U.S. adults say gun laws should be stricter while 31 believe they should be kept as they are now and 12 favor less strict gun laws. These attitudes collected before last week s mass shooting in Lewiston Maine are unchanged from a year ago but they reflect less support for stricter laws than in June 2022 66 after the Uvalde Texas school shooting. Majorities have consistently favored stricter gun laws since 2015 with notable spikes in that view after prominent shootings such as in Uvalde and Parkland Florida in 2018. Gallup first asked Americans about their preferences for gun laws using the current wording in 1990. Since then majorities have typically called for stricter laws including a high of 78 in the initial September 1990 measurement amid heightened concern about crime and ongoing congressional debate over the Brady Bill handgun legislation which ultimately passed in 1993. The exceptions to majoritylevel support for stricter laws occurred between 2008 and 2014 when between 43 and 49 favored tougher laws with that trend temporarily interrupted by a December 2012 58 reading conducted shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The pattern of increased support for stricter gun laws after prominent shootings suggests that a higher proportion than the 56 measured in the Oct. 223 poll would favor tougher laws if measured today in the wake of the Oct. 25 Lewiston shootings. An Army reservist killed 18 people in shootings at two locations in the Maine town. While Americans do want gun laws tightened they also do not favor a ban on handguns for ordinary citizens something Gallup has asked about since 1959. Just 27 of U.S. adults believe that no one outside of police or other authorized persons should be able to possess a handgun. The current figure is on the lower end of what Gallup has measured historically including 60 who favored a ban in 1959 and roughly four in 10 Americans in most surveys conducted between 1975 and 1993. The low point of 19 favoring a ban came in an October 2021 survey. Opposition to a handgun ban is consistent with Americans belief that having guns makes people s homes safer rather than more dangerous. Currently 64 believe guns make homes safer while 32 believe they make them more dangerous. Public opinion on this issue has shifted over time. When Gallup first asked this version of the question in 2000 a slim majority of 51 believed guns made homes more dangerous places to live. Americans views were evenly divided in 2004 and 2006 but by 2014 the majority had come to believe that guns made homes safer. Opinions have held steady since then. As might be expected the overwhelming majority of those with a gun in their household 86 believe guns make homes safer just 12 disagree. Among those living in households without guns opinion is divided 45 believe they are safer and 49 more dangerous places to live with guns present. Democrats overwhelmingly believe gun laws should be made stricter and believe guns make homes more dangerous. They are also much more likely than Republicans to favor a handgun ban. In contrast Republicans generally want gun laws kept as they are now and believe guns make homes safer. Independents side with Democrats on wanting stricter gun laws but they are closer to Republicans in believing guns increase home safety rather than decrease it. Today s partisan differences on guns contrast with relatively modest gaps two decades ago. Fortyfour percent of U.S. adults say they have a gun in their home or on their property with 30 saying the gun belongs to them personally and the remainder saying it belongs to another household member. These percentages are steady compared with recent years although Gallup measured higher rates of household gun possession between 50 and 53 in the early 1990s. Gun ownership rates have increased among Republicans over the past two decades 45 of Republicans say they personally own a gun and 58 live in a gun household. In 2000 the figures were 32 and 48 respectively. Among independents ownership rates are similar to what they were in 2000 with 29 personally owning a gun and 43 living in a gun household. Democratic gun ownership has declined slightly. Now 18 of Democrats say they personally own a gun and 29 live in a gun household compared with 23 and 36 respectively in 2000. The new poll confirms prior years finding that U.S. gun owners typically have more than one gun. Currently 29 of Americans who have a gun in their household report having one gun while 33 say they have between two and four guns and 22 have five or more. Sixteen percent of respondents from gun households would not disclose how many guns they own. On seven other occasions since 1993 Gallup has asked those with guns to say how many guns their household owns. In each of those surveys majorities of 59 or greater have said their household had multiple guns. But gun owners may now be owning more total guns than in the past. U.S. adults with a gun in their household say their house has an average of 4.9 guns. In prior surveys the average number of guns owned ranged between 4.0 and 4.5. However because of smaller sample sizes of gun owners in each survey and a large variation in the reported number of guns the current estimate is not significantly higher than past measures from a statistical perspective. The gun issue has played a major role in U.S. political debate in recent years and each mass shooting such as the one that occurred in Maine last week returns the issue to the forefront. Though the two major U.S. political parties are increasingly divided on the issue Americans as a whole have been largely consistent in wanting gun laws to be stricter but also opposing a handgun ban. Their views on whether guns make homes safer or more dangerous have shifted with a solid majority now believing guns make homes safer. Last year in response to the Uvalde shooting Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation designed to address gun violence which was hailed as the first major federal legislation on the issue in decades. The legislation expanded background checks on gun purchases for young adults increased mental health funding expanded prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence and created incentives for states to pass red flag laws. However Americans apparently did not see those steps as going far enough to prevent gun violence with no decrease since the law was signed in the percentage wanting laws to be tougher. That could reflect that Americans favor a number of proposals that have been offered as antidotes to gun violence including longer waiting periods for gun purchases and an assault weapons ban that were not included in the legislation.

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/06/28/views-of-u-s-gun-laws-impact-of-gun-ownership-on-safety/, This question highlights the sharp contrasts between partisans over the role of guns in society 79 of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents say that gun ownership does more to increase safety while a nearly identical share of Democrats and Democratic leaners 78 say that it does more to decrease safety. Gun owners and nonowners also are divided. Among the 32 of adults who say they personally own a gun 71 say that gun ownership increases safety. Among the 65 of adults who do not own a gun just 37 say the same. A majority of nonowners 61 say that gun ownership does more to decrease safety. There are also large divisions among Americans based on community type. Among those who say they live in urban areas 64 say gun ownership makes people less safe while 34 say it does more to increase safety. Among those who live in rural areas these shares are roughly reversed 65 say gun ownership does more to increase safety compared with 33 who say it does more to decrease safety. Those who report living in suburban areas are about as likely to say that gun ownership increases safety 51 as to say it decreases safety 47. About half of Americans 49 say they live in suburban areas while roughly a quarter report living in either rural 26 or urban areas 24. For more on selfreported community type read our publication Evaluating what makes a U.S. community urban suburban or rural.  Views on whether gun laws in the United States should be stricter less strict or are about right have fluctuated modestly in recent years. Currently 58 say gun laws should be stricter while 26 say laws are about right and 15 say they should be less strict. Two years ago 53 favored stricter gun laws. In 2019 60 said laws should be stricter. Demographic differences in views of gun policy have been stable in recent years. A majority of women 64 say that gun laws should be stricter than they are today compared with 51 of men. Roughly threequarters of Black 77 and Asian adults 74 say this compared with 68 of Hispanic adults and 51 of White adults. Younger adults are somewhat more likely to support stricter gun laws than older adults though majorities across age groups favor stricter laws. There also are educational divides on this issue 72 of adults with a postgraduate education say that gun laws should be stricter compared with 52 of adults with a high school degree or less formal education. As in recent years Republicans who identify as moderate or liberal are more likely to favor stricter gun laws than those who describe themselves as conservatives. Roughly fourinten moderate or liberal Republicans 42 say that laws should be stricter while 40 say current laws are about right and 17 say they should be less strict. Among conservative Republicans just 19 say laws should be stricter while 33 say they should be less strict and 48 say current laws are about right. Large majorities of Democrats across ideological groups say that gun laws should be stricter than they are today 92 of liberal Democrats and 81 of conservative or moderate Democrats say this. Americans who live in urban communities are substantially more likely than those who live in rural communities to favor stricter gun laws. People who don t own guns are about twice as likely as gun owners to say that gun laws should be stricter 71 of nonowners say this compared with 35 of gun owners. By contrast gun owners are roughly twice as likely as nonowners to say that current laws are about right 39 vs. 20 and about three times as likely to say that gun laws should be less strict 26 vs. 8. Within each party there are divisions in the opinions of those who own guns and those who do not. Roughly fourinten Republicans who don t own guns 41 say that gun laws should be stricter compared with just 15 of Republican gun owners. Republican gun owners are more likely than nonowners to say that current laws are about right 49 vs. 41 or that they should be less strict 35 vs. 17. While large majorities of Democratic gun owners 73 say that laws should be stricter Democrats who don t own guns overwhelmingly hold this view 89.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/, The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms and about a third of U.S. adults say they personally own a gun. At the same time in response to concerns such as rising gun death rates and mass shootings President Joe Biden has proposed gun policy legislation that would expand on the bipartisan gun safety bill Congress passed last year. Here are some key findings about Americans views of gun ownership gun policy and other subjects drawn primarily from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June 2023. Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to summarize key facts about Americans and guns. We used data from recent Center surveys to provide insights into Americans views on gun policy and how those views have changed over time as well as to examine the proportion of adults who own guns and their reasons for doing so. The analysis draws primarily from a survey of 5115 U.S. adults conducted from June 5 to June 11 2023. Everyone who took part in the surveys cited is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for the analysis on gun ownership the questions used for the analysis on gun policy and the survey s methodology. Additional information about the fall 2022 survey of parents and its methodology can be found at the link in the text of this post. Measuring gun ownership in the United States comes with unique challenges. Unlike many demographic measures there is not a definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many American adults own guns. The Pew Research Center survey conducted June 511 2023 on the Center s American Trends Panel asks about gun ownership using two separate questions to measure personal and household ownership. About a third of adults 32 say they own a gun while another 10 say they do not personally own a gun but someone else in their household does. These shares have changed little from surveys conducted in 2021 and 2017. In each of those surveys 30 reported they owned a gun. These numbers are largely consistent with rates of gun ownership reported by Gallup but somewhat higher than those reported by NORC s General Social Survey. Those surveys also find only modest changes in recent years. The FBI maintains data on background checks on individuals attempting to purchase firearms in the United States. The FBI reported a surge in background checks in 2020 and 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of federal background checks declined in 2022 and through the first half of this year according to FBI statistics. About fourinten U.S. adults say they live in a household with a gun including 32 who say they personally own one according to an August report based on our June survey. These numbers are virtually unchanged since the last time we asked this question in 2021. There are differences in gun ownership rates by political affiliation gender community type and other factors. Personal protection tops the list of reasons gun owners give for owning a firearm. About threequarters 72 of gun owners say that protection is a major reason they own a gun. Considerably smaller shares say that a major reason they own a gun is for hunting 32 for sport shooting 30 as part of a gun collection 15 or for their job 7.  The reasons behind gun ownership have changed only modestly since our 2017 survey of attitudes toward gun ownership and gun policies. At that time 67 of gun owners cited protection as a major reason they owned a firearm. Gun owners tend to have much more positive feelings about having a gun in the house than nonowners who live with them. For instance 71 of gun owners say they enjoy owning a gun but far fewer nongun owners in gunowning households 31 say they enjoy having one in the home. And while 81 of gun owners say owning a gun makes them feel safer a narrower majority 57 of nonowners in gun households say the same about having a firearm at home. Nonowners are also more likely than owners to worry about having a gun in the home 27 vs. 12 respectively. Feelings about gun ownership also differ by political affiliation even among those who personally own firearms. Republican gun owners are more likely than Democratic owners to say owning a gun gives them feelings of safety and enjoyment while Democratic owners are more likely to say they worry about having a gun in the home. Nongun owners are split on whether they see themselves owning a firearm in the future. About half 52 of Americans who don t own a gun say they could never see themselves owning one while nearly as many 47 could imagine themselves as gun owners in the future. Americans are evenly split over whether gun ownership does more to increase or decrease safety. About half 49 say it does more to increase safety by allowing lawabiding citizens to protect themselves but an equal share say gun ownership does more to reduce safety by giving too many people access to firearms and increasing misuse. Republicans and Democrats differ on this question 79 of Republicans say that gun ownership does more to increase safety while a nearly identical share of Democrats 78 say that it does more to reduce safety. Urban and rural Americans also have starkly different views. Among adults who live in urban areas 64 say gun ownership reduces safety while 34 say it does more to increase safety. Among those who live in rural areas 65 say gun ownership increases safety compared with 33 who say it does more to reduce safety. Those living in the suburbs are about evenly split. Americans increasingly say that gun violence is a major problem. Sixinten U.S. adults say gun violence is a very big problem in the country today up 9 percentage points from spring 2022. In the survey conducted this June 23 say gun violence is a moderately big problem and about twointen say it is either a small problem 13 or not a problem at all 4. Looking ahead 62 of Americans say they expect the level of gun violence to increase over the next five years. This is double the share who expect it to stay the same 31. Just 7 expect the level of gun violence to decrease. A majority of Americans 61 say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun in this country. Another 30 say the ease of legally obtaining a gun is about right and 9 say it is too hard to get a gun. Nongun owners are nearly twice as likely as gun owners to say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun 73 vs. 38. Meanwhile gun owners are more than twice as likely as nonowners to say the ease of obtaining a gun is about right 48 vs. 20. Partisan and demographic differences also exist on this question. While 86 of Democrats say it is too easy to obtain a gun legally 34 of Republicans say the same. Most urban 72 and suburban 63 dwellers say it s too easy to legally obtain a gun. Rural residents are more divided 47 say it is too easy 41 say it is about right and 11 say it is too hard. About sixinten U.S. adults 58 favor stricter gun laws. Another 26 say that U.S. gun laws are about right and 15 favor less strict gun laws. The percentage who say these laws should be stricter has fluctuated a bit in recent years. In 2021 53 favored stricter gun laws and in 2019 60 said laws should be stricter. About a third 32 of parents with K12 students say they are very or extremely worried about a shooting ever happening at their children s school according to a fall 2022 Center survey of parents with at least one child younger than 18. A similar share of K12 parents 31 say they are not too or not at all worried about a shooting ever happening at their children s school while 37 of parents say they are somewhat worried. Among all parents with children under 18 including those who are not in school 63 see improving mental health screening and treatment as a very or extremely effective way to prevent school shootings. This is larger than the shares who say the same about having police officers or armed security in schools 49 banning assaultstyle weapons 45 or having metal detectors in schools 41. Just 24 of parents say allowing teachers and school administrators to carry guns in school would be a very or extremely effective approach while half say this would be not too or not at all effective. There is broad partisan agreement on some gun policy proposals but most are politically divisive the June 2023 survey found. Majorities of U.S. adults in both partisan coalitions somewhat or strongly favor two policies that would restrict gun access preventing those with mental illnesses from purchasing guns 88 of Republicans and 89 of Democrats support this and increasing the minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old 69 of Republicans 90 of Democrats. Majorities in both parties also oppose allowing people to carry concealed firearms without a permit 60 of Republicans and 91 of Democrats oppose this. Republicans and Democrats differ on several other proposals. While 85 of Democrats favor banning both assaultstyle weapons and highcapacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds majorities of Republicans oppose these proposals 57 and 54 respectively. Most Republicans on the other hand support allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K12 schools 74 and allowing people to carry concealed guns in more places 71. These proposals are supported by just 27 and 19 of Democrats respectively. Gun ownership is linked with views on gun policies. Americans who own guns are less likely than nonowners to favor restrictions on gun ownership with a notable exception. Nearly identical majorities of gun owners 87 and nonowners 89 favor preventing mentally ill people from buying guns. Within both parties differences between gun owners and nonowners are evident but they are especially stark among Republicans. For example majorities of Republicans who do not own guns support banning highcapacity ammunition magazines and assaultstyle weapons compared with about threeinten Republican gun owners. Among Democrats majorities of both gun owners and nonowners favor these two proposals though support is greater among nonowners.  Note This is an update of a post originally published on Jan. 5 2016.
