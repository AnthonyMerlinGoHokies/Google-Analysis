Scott Olson Ensure Every American Can Vote Voting Reform As the coronavirus ravages the country presidential primary elections have been among the casualties. At least 16 states have already delayed some elections or allowed citizens to vote by mail with extended deadlines. The latter move has helped renew a contentious debate in Washington DC and across the country should a votebymail option be widely available in all states before the 2020 presidential election to help protect voters and poll workers from Covid19? The Brennan Center believes it should as do many state and local election officials of both parties. President Trump warned that these changes would lead to levels of voting that would hurt him and his party even though Republicans have long supported the option. Recognizing that argument could not be sustained publicly the president now worries about fraud claiming a lot of people cheat with mail in voting.  In fact much of the country votes by mail already. Indeed so does President Trump who votes by absentee ballot. There is ample experience to show that a votebymail option is safe and gives citizens the ability to participate. More broadly the coronavirus has given us no choice. If we want to have an election that is free fair secure and safe we must have the option for people to vote by mail in November. The coronavirus has made congregating in small enclosed spaces dangerous. At many polling places voters particularly of color and from poorer communities already wait in long crowded lines to vote. During a pandemic such lines would force citizens to choose between their health and their right to vote.  We must be able to run a free fair and safe election in November. Dr. Anthony Fauci director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has already warned that the virus will almost certainly strike again this fall. That makes vote by mail an essential way for voters to stay safe while exercising their right to choose who governs them. To ignore and even block a solution that maintains our electoral system would be democratic malpractice. The nation already had a preview of what an election should not look like under pandemic conditions in Wisconsin s April 7 presidential primary. A critical shortage of poll workers. Shuttered polling locations. Long lines made even longer because of social distancing. People in protective masks. Members of the National Guard staffing the remaining polling stations. To make sure that vote by mail and other critical capacitybuilding can be implemented in time for November we have to start putting new processes in place now. Unlike primaries the general election can t be moved. That s why the Brennan Center has asked Congress to provide at least 4 billion for states to use in this fight. Those funds will enable states to protect election integrity in November. Since our founding neither war nor pestilence has ever prevented Americans from voting. We can t let the coronavirus break that streak.  Much of the country now votes by mail. It s already deeply embedded into the American electoral system. Twentythree percent of ballots were cast by mail in 2016 and twentysix percent of ballots were cast by mail in 2018. Five states Hawaii Utah Oregon Washington and Colorado will run allmail elections this year. And in 28 states and the District of Columbia any voter has the right to request a mail ballot without excuse in November. Some of these like California are big states that have made votebymail a core way they run elections. Many more states have a votebymail option but they are illequipped to handle the significant increase in the number of ballots that would come in amid the pandemic. They need first and foremost funds from the federal government.  Currently 17 states including Alabama New York and New Hampshire need to change their policies to guarantee that all who want to vote by mail in November can. Restricting who can vote by mail this year at best makes voting unnecessarily difficult and at worst puts their citizens at unnecessary risk of catching the coronavirus. If these states are to provide all voters a votebymail option before the November election they must start preparations now. No. There is no evidence that voting by mail results in significant fraud. As with inperson voting the threat is infinitesimally small. As Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado reminded President Trump after he opposed vote by mail on fraud grounds Mr. President we ve had vote by mail in Colorado for years. We don t have fraud. But we do have the second highest turnout in America.  There are many. The ballot envelope itself can be designed to prevent fraud. Voters have to sign the envelope and that signature can be compared to the one that s already on file for the voter. It s important to note though that there are best and worst practices with signature matching. When done incorrectly it can disenfranchise eligible voters. Done correctly which includes a review by a bipartisan group of election officials it can be an effective deterrent for fraud. States can also track ballots in transit. Much like a FedEx package the ballot comes with a barcode that allows election officials and voters to track where the ballot is throughout the process. Most people who vote this way however do not send in ballots by mail. Instead they drop them off at secure government offices or other locations. According to MIT s election lab in 2016 73 of voters in Colorado 59 in Oregon and 65 in Washington returned their ballots to some physical location such as a drop box or local election office. Even among those who returned their ballots by mail in these states 47 dropped off their ballot at a U.S. Post Office or neighborhood mailbox rather than having their own postal worker pick it up at home. These drop boxes can be made more secure with cameras or other security measures. Finally postelection audits can identify any irregularities that may remain. In 2018 a congressional election in North Carolina was marred by absentee ballot misconduct by a Republican political operative requiring a revote. That misconduct was caught by a state postelection investigation. The Brennan Center has not called for voting only by mail in 2020. Even if it were a good idea it would be impossible to implement it in such a short time. Fully participatory elections in many states will require ample inperson voting opportunities. At a time of pandemic that means adequate early voting so that people do not crowd polling places on Election Day. Moreover some communities don t have reliable access to the mail. Many Native American reservations for example don t have addresses recognized by the U.S. Postal Service and therefore residents must rely on P.O. boxes far from their homes for mail. Some voters also rely on assistance whether it s translation or specially designed machines for those with disabilities to cast their ballots. The goal for every member of Congress every state legislature and every election official should be simple ensure that anyone who has the right to vote can exercise that right as simply and safely as possible. This shouldn t be a partisan issue but a patriotic duty. Vote by mail is just one option among many to accomplish that goal.  Analysis The Good News About Democracy in 2023 While serious threats to democracy remain there is also a growing prodemocracy movement pushing many states in the right direction.  Analysis Freedom to Vote in Jeopardy Especially for People of Color Many politicians continue to try to weaken our electoral systems and implement antivoting policies prompting Congress to reintroduce legislation setting national standards.

https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/mail-voting-is-safe-secure/, Mail ballots submitted by voters who meet eligibility and validity requirements are counted in every election. Before they are counted election officials vigorously verify the validity of every mail ballot submission as explained below. Mail ballots suspected of fraudulent activity are set aside for further investigation and when appropriate are referred to law enforcement for prosecution. Mail voting also referred to as absentee voting has been in use since it helped soldiers cast ballots during the Civil War. Mail voting has been increasing in usage since the 1980s with unprecedented expansions taking place since the COVID19 pandemic. Mail voting is a safe secure and reliable voting method used by voters of all political parties. Many states have changed their mail voting laws since the 2020 election. Check with your local election office to learn about which voting options are available to you and what the deadlines are to apply for and cast a mail ballot. Election night vote totals are unofficial pending the canvass and official certification which includes a thorough review and verification process that takes place in the days and weeks following an election. Because mail ballots take additional time to process verify and count the unofficial results you see on election night may not include all mail ballot totals. Final certified election results include all valid ballots cast during the election including those submitted by mail. Every mail ballot is verified for eligibility after it is returned by the voter. Mail ballot envelopes typically require a voter s signature identification number or other identifying information. Before a ballot is counted election officials check to make sure that the signature or identification number matches that which is on file. The mail ballot also must be postmarked received by an election official or both by a date set in state law. Once validated the ballot is separated from its envelope and sorted for counting. Mail ballots suspected of fraudulent activity are set aside for further investigation and when applicable are referred to law enforcement for prosecution. In addition to verifying the identity of mail voters many election officials also take the following precautions to ensure the security of mail voting If a voter submits more than one mail ballot or tries to vote in person after already voting by mail only one ballot will be counted and the instance of double voting will be flagged for further investigation. At least 46 states enable voters to track the status of their mail ballot online. Ballot tracking typically utilizes both election office and U.S. Postal Service data to supply voters with the following information To find information on how to track your mail ballot contact your local election office or find statespecific information here httpswww.vote.orgballottrackertools To ensure all eligible voters have their voices heard 30 states and some local jurisdictions rely on a process called curing to give voters a chance to fix or cure problems on their ballot envelope and have their vote counted. Typically election officials contact the voter by email phone or mail if there is an issue with the eligibility of their mail ballot. To have their ballot counted voters must provide a new signature or other identifying information to verify their ballot s eligibility. Turnaround times are often short and curing timelines vary by state and locality. Voters who need to cure their ballot envelope should respond quickly to requests from their local election office. You may have options available to you if you decide that you would prefer to vote inperson after requesting an absentee or mail ballot. Some states require voters who have already been issued a mail ballot to surrender that ballot when voting inperson or to vote by provisional ballot. Provisional ballots are set aside for additional verification when a voter s eligibility is in question. If you choose to vote inperson your mail ballot will not be counted and vice versa. Only a small minority of states permit you to vote inperson after already submitting a mail ballot in those states your previously submitted mail ballot is voided upon voting inperson. Because state rules vary it s best to contact your local election office for guidance on how to vote inperson after requesting or receiving a mail ballot. States vary in how they refer to ballots that are submitted outside of a polling place.  Absentee voting and mail voting are typically synonymous and interchangeable. Absentee or mail voting is a catchall term used to refer to any voting that takes place outside of the polling place including ballots transmitted through mail submitted into a drop box or filled out and placed into an envelope at an election office before Election Day. Several types of mail voting are available to voters in the 2024 elections depending on the laws in their state. While all states offer some form of mail voting many states have changed their mail voting laws since the 2020 election. Check with your local election office to learn about which voting options are available to you and what the deadlines are to apply for and cast a mail ballot. Mail ballots can be returned through the mail at an election office and in some states in an official drop box. Drop boxes are secure locations where you can safely submit a completed mail ballot. They are put in place by government officials and are often under 24hour video surveillance. Only election officials can access a ballot once it s placed in a drop box. Using an official drop box can be a more reliable option when there are concerns about the time it may take a ballot to go through the U.S. Postal Service especially in the last two weeks before election day. A ballot submitted to an official drop box before the deadline will reach an election official in time to be counted. Official ballot drop boxes provided by government representatives are secure and reliable. Not all jurisdictions offer drop boxes. When in doubt confirm official drop box availability and locations with your local election office.

https://ballotpedia.org/Arguments_for_and_against_no-excuse_absentee/mail-in_voting, Email  First Name  Last Name   Share this page  Follow Ballotpedia  Share this page  Follow Ballotpedia Absenteemailin voting is voting that does not happen in person on Election Day but instead occurs another way usually by mail. 1 All states allow for some form of absenteemailin voting. Some states require voters to provide an accepted excuse such as being away from their home county on Election Day being required to work during polling hours or having a disability to vote by mail. Other states allow any eligible voter to cast an absenteemailin ballot. Most states require voters to fill out an application to receive an absenteemailin ballot. 2  Whether noexcuse absenteemailin voting is beneficial or harmful and whether it should be expanded or restricted are subjects of debate.  This section includes quotes briefly summarizing some of the most prevalent arguments for and against expanding noexcuse absenteemailin voting. Three arguments in favor of noexcuse absenteemailin voting are that it makes voting more accessible to particular demographics that it does not significantly benefit one political party and that best practices exist for preventing fraud and increasing reliability. This section includes quotations from a variety of sources exemplifying these arguments.  In a 2019 press release ACLU Virginia argued that allowing noexcuse absenteemailin voting in Virginia would increase accessibility for minority voters voters with disabilities those in rural communities and more. On its website ACLU Virginia describes itself as a private nonprofit organization that promotes civil liberties and civil rights for everyone in the Commonwealth through public education litigation and advocacy with the goal of securing freedom and equality for all. 5  If Virginia law limits noexcuse absentee voting to inperson only qualified voters may be excluded from participating based upon a lack of readily accessible transportation geography income status physical disabilities and the constraints of modernday individuals and families. There are localities in Virginia where voters do not have ready access to transportation that permits them to travel to designated locations to vote by absentee ballot inperson. In rural jurisdictions some voters are not able to access the registrar s office which may be on the opposite side of the county. In urban locations voters without vehicles may not have ready access to public transportation to travel to a distant absentee voting site.  Additionally there are voters whose work or childcare schedules simply cannot accommodate the registrar s limited office hours so that they could cast inperson absentee ballots. We are also concerned that by limiting absentee voting to inperson it may disproportionately impact minority and rural communities and persons with disabilities. 6  In a 2020 Science Magazine article Warren Cornwall wrote about a research study on the partisan benefits of noexcuse absenteemailin voting that was conducted by political scientists Michael Barber of Brigham Young University and John Holbein of University of Virginia The researchers found that in presidential and midterm general elections between 1996 and 2018 switching to allmail voting increased the percentage of residents who voted by 1.8 to 2.9 they report today in Science Advances. When it came to the Democratic share of the vote they found a tiny uptick in the share of votes that went to Democratic candidates for Congress governor and president approximately 0.7. But the difference was so small that the margin of statistical error means it s possible there was no effect at all John Holbein at the University of Virginia says. There might be a teensy tiny effect on Democratic turnout. 6  In a 2020 analysis for the Brennan Center for Justice which describes itself as a nonpartisan law and policy advocacy organization working to advance reforms to improve democracy Wendy Weiser and Harold Ekeh wrote that best practices exist in the states that primarily use absenteemailin voting systems. They argued that data shows incidents of fraud associated with these best practices are rare 9  In the last two federal elections roughly one out of every four Americans cast a mail ballot. In five states Colorado Hawaii Oregon Utah and Washington mail balloting has been the primary method of voting. In 28 additional states all voters have had the right to vote by mail ballot if they choose without having to provide any reason or excuse. Over time a growing number of voters have chosen that option. Since 2000 more than 250 million votes have been cast via mailedout ballots in all 50 states according to the Vote at Home Institute. In 2018 more than 31 million Americans cast their ballots by mail about 25.8 percent of election participants.  Despite this dramatic increase in mail voting over time fraud rates remain infinitesimally small. None of the five states that hold their elections primarily by mail has had any voter fraud scandals since making that change. . .While mail ballots are more susceptible to fraud than inperson voting it is still more likely for an American to be struck by lightning than to commit mail voting fraud. 6  Three arguments against expanding noexcuse absenteemailin voting are that it increases the risk of fraud that it delays election results and that ballots are too important to send through the mail. This section includes quotations from a variety of sources exemplifying these arguments.  In a 2020 oped Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton R argued that fraud is more likely to occur through absenteemailin voting than inperson voting Both sides of the political aisle have long agreed that voting by mailin ballot increases the likelihood of fraud. ... In Texas to prevent fraud we must show an ID when we vote just as we are required to show a form of ID at the airport government buildings financial institutions and during many other daily activities. But there is no effective way for election officials to ensure that mailin ballots are not requested fraudulently. ... My office has conducted over 300 investigations of mailin ballot fraud. Our investigators have spoken with thousands of victims of mail ballot fraud over the years and they commonly tell us they were pressured and harassed by campaign workers to sign up to vote by mail vote a certain way or hand over their ballots. The common denominator in mail ballot fraud is that the votes of the victims are cancelled and replaced by those of paid campaign workers. Every fraudulent vote disenfranchises a lawful voter by canceling out their lawful vote. 6  In a 2020 opinion piece in the Minnesota Post Gentry Lange director of The No Vote By Mail Project argued that absenteemailin voting delays the reporting of election results  Moving to allmail voting would be nothing short of a catastrophe for our democracy. Just consider how long it takes to count a vote by mail election. When I ran for city council in Bremerton Washington in 2009 there were roughly 7000 votes cast and that election alone took weeks to decide. This is what an allmail voting system will do to the country expanded to an exponentially larger scale. It will make all elections less accurate less precise and require far longer to tabulate. Elections that formerly took place at the school or down the street were counted in one night but when ballots trickle in through the mail the process takes a month or more to decide. Even the proverbial election for the county dogcatcher would not yield a result for weeks. 6  In a 2022 article called We Shouldn t Be Promoting Voting By Mail Hans von Spakovsky senior legal fellow at the Heritage Foundation argued that ballots are too important for voters to trust sending them through the mail. According to its website the Heritage Foundation says its mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise limited government individual freedom traditional American values and a strong national defense. 13  Ask yourself If you won 500 million in the Powerball lottery would you put your winning ticket into an envelope and trust the U.S. Postal Service to deliver it to the state agency that administers the lottery? Or would you want to deliver your ticket personally to lottery officials to ensure that they received it and acknowledge that you are the owner of that ticket? The answer is pretty obvious to just about anyone. So why would we want to encourage voters to cast their ballots through the mail or place them in unsupervised unsecured drop boxes instead of voting in person in a polling place? A polling place under the bipartisan supervision of election officials and the observation of poll watchers has numerous advantages. It helps ensure not only that the ballots are completed by the registered voters and deposited in a locked sealed ballot box but also that the voters eligibility and identity are verified that no voters are pressured or coerced to vote a particular way by candidates party activists and political gunsforhire who are all prohibited from being inside the polling place and that no ballots get lost in the mail or not delivered on time. 6  Several states temporarily changed their absenteemailin voting procedures in response to the 2020 COVID19 pandemic.

Sections Sections Share Share Search Sections Sections Share Share Subscribe to Governance WeeklySign Up Commentary Many states have moved to votebymail in recent years in order to make it more convenient to vote and in the past few months to avoid the possible COVID health risks associated with large crowds at polling places. Yet there remain questions about how many states use it how mail balloting operates what its political consequences are whether the use of mail ballots increases electoral fraud and how popular it is with voters. There are two kinds of mail balloting systems universal vote by mail and absentee balloting. In 2016 nearly onequarter of U.S. votes were cast by mail.Despite partisan fears research suggests neither party gains an advantage.There is no evidence that mail ballots increase electoral fraud. Several antifraud protections are built into the process. Those who abuse mail ballots can be charged with election fraud and face fines or prison time.WatchA Closer LookHow many states allow mail balloting?There are two kinds of mail balloting systems. Some states have what are called universal vote by mail in which states mail ballots to all voters. In most states however vote by mail is through absentee balloting in which the voter must request an absentee ballot. In 2016 nearly onequarter of U.S. votes 33 million were cast by either universal mail or absentee ballots. As shown on the map below from the National Council of State Legislatures 34 states plus the District of Columbia now allow voters in the weeks before an election to request absentee ballots. Another 11 states have made it easier to request absentee ballots for primary elections taking place this year in large part due to concern over the coronavirus. As a result of COVID there has been extensive fear about long lines and big crowds at polling places. If there continues to be public concern over the virus or there is a second infection wave in the fall some of these states may extend their absentee voting options to the general election. States set the rules on mail balloting and election processes so they can change the rules through bills passed by the legislature and signed into law by the governor. In states that allow absentee mail balloting the voter writes calls or goes online to request an absentee ballot from their local election authority. In some places voters need an excuse for the absentee ballot such as being sick or out of the state on Election Day. In other places voters do not need to have a specific reason for the absentee ballot or the state provides the option by mailing absentee ballots to all registered voters. Many states are moving to this system generally referred to as NoExcuse Absentee balloting. In making their request voters have to provide their name and address. After receipt of the request local election authorities send a ballot to the voter at the home address and provides one security envelope for the ballot that keeps the vote choice private and another envelope into which the sealed ballot is placed. The voter signs the outside of the second envelope to certify he or she is a registered voter. Upon receipt of the mailed ballot local election authorities check the name of the voter to make sure the person is registered to vote and is casting a ballot from the address registered with the election authority. After certifying those facts they remove the sealed ballot from the outside envelope containing the voter signature so that the voter s preferences remain confidential. On Election Day states count the mail ballots and add the results to the votes of those individuals who cast their ballots in person. Republicans fear mail balloting will increase votes for Democrats. They worry that individuals who are part of groups that typically vote in lower numbers will cast absentee ballots because of the ease of doing so. This includes young people lowincome people minorities and those without access to transportation. Yet one group that benefits from absentee ballots is senior citizens who often skew GOP. Those who are incapacitated or sick can request mail ballots as can those who cannot drive or lack access to mass transit. Mail ballots represent a way for those individuals to exercise their constitutional rights at election time. Republicans have won in legislative districts having a large number of mail ballots. In a 2020 California special election for Congress for example Republicans captured a seat that previously had been held by Democrats. They did so by getting out the vote and making sure their voters had access to absentee ballots. A major study of California Utah and Washington state conducted by Daniel Thompson Jesse Yoder Jennifer Wu and Andrew Hall of Stanford University for elections between 1996 and 2018 concluded there was no partisan advantage to either party based on voting by mail. If candidates believe there has been voter fraud they can present evidence regarding a particular race to the election board or file a lawsuit in a local court. Authorities review the evidence and decide if there has been actual fraud. If there is sufficient evidence local prosecutors can indict the relevant people for mail ballot fraud. It is a criminal offense to forge a name on a mail ballot impersonate someone else steal ballots or deceive someone about their mail ballot. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University there is no evidence that mail balloting increases electoral fraud as there are several antifraud protections built into the process designed to make it difficult to impersonate voters or steal ballots. These provisions include requiring people requesting absentee ballots to be registered voters mailing ballots to the official address listed on voter registration rolls requiring voter signatures on the external envelope and having election authorities make sure the ballot came from the address of an actual voter. If a ballot appears questionable some states use a signature matching technique to verify the signature of the voter. These steps make it difficult to engage in fraud on a widespread basis. You can t request a ballot for a person that is mailed to your address as opposed to that person s official address with the election authorities. Even if someone wanted to wait by a mailbox for the absentee ballot to be sent to the registered voters so you could steal their ballot you would never know what day the absentee ballot would arrive because voters can request them for several weeks prior to an election and election authorities send them out as the requests come in. For years military personnel stationed abroad have voted by absentee ballot with virtually no claims of election fraud. The procedures that already are in use safeguard against abuse and ensure the integrity of the voting process. The few cases of voter fraud that have been documented tend to be quite localized. For example in 2018 North Carolina Republicans were cited for election fraud involving mail ballots. A campaign staff member who worked for Mark Harris in his Ninth Congressional district race was indicted for mishandling mail ballots and directing others to engage in election fraud. The evidence was so widespread that a federal judge invalidated the election and called for a special election. In 2020 there has been considerable party contentiousness over mailing balloting provisions. For example a plan to have mail ballots sent to every California voter has been challenged in court by the Republican National Committee. The party s stated concern is that mail balloting will undermine election integrity and increase fraud. Yet mail balloting generally is popular with voters because they don t have to stand in line to cast ballots and they can vote at their convenience in the weeks leading up to election day. Fiftynine percent support holding elections by mail. That reform saves people time and at a time of a major pandemic protects their health. The growing use of mail ballots shows how substantially the election environment has changed in recent years and why voters should pay close attention to voting reforms in their particular states.

Democrats across the nation are pushing mailin ballots for every voter in November. Not wanting to let the crisis caused by COVID19 go to waste they ve disguised their plot to manipulate the integrity of our election system by arguing that voters fear contracting COVID19 if they physically show up to the polls. Democrat leadership clearly wants noncitizens to vote which is ironic since they also claim to be concerned about foreign influence over our elections. The Left is willing to mar our democracy for a chance at winning at the ballot box. That is simply unAmerican. It is also no secret that both sides of the political aisle have long agreed that voting by mailin ballot increases the likelihood of fraud. During a 2004 Congressional hearing House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerry Nadler DNY said In my experience in New York paper ballots are extremely susceptible to fraud. I could show you experience which would make your head spin. Just two years ago in a legislative hearing in Austin a prosecutor from South Texas and registered Democrat testified Any time you have ballots that are outside the polling location you re going to have fraud I would never recommend everyone voting by mail it invites fraud.  Democrats are selling Americans a false narrative election integrity will jeopardize personal safety. Election officials have many options available to safely and securely hold inperson elections. They can provide masks hand sanitizer and gloves. They can enforce physical distancing recommendations sanitize voting stations and implement other practical solutions so voting machines can be operated touchfree. To shorten waiting times and lines at polls they could also expand the number of early voting days as we did in Texas for the primary elections. With precautions like these voters can access polling places safely and exercise their vote without fear of being defrauded. If we safely choose to go to shopping malls restaurants or even large public protests we have no excuse to forego our constitutionalright to vote and to do so in person. In Texas to prevent fraud we must show an ID when we vote just as we are required to show a form of ID at the airport government buildings financial institutions and during many other daily activities. But there is no effective way for election officials to ensure that mailin ballots are not requested fraudulently. Just as credit card skimmers can steal your financial information vote harvesters can easily collect authentic signatures under false pretenses and steal your vote. During the 2018 primary an anonymous video surfaced that appears to show how easily a Houstonarea campaign worker collected a ballot application and signature from a voter in less than 20 seconds. After providing her signature the voter asked the worker Is this legal what you re doing? The worker replied Yes ma am we ve done 400 already.  Once mail ballots go out harvesters show up at a voter s door and offer voting assistance. They often appear friendly and helpful. Successful vote harvesters leave with a voter s signature and a ballot that is blank that is correctly voted or that can be modified later. Or the harvester can simply discard the ballot if the voter chose the wrong candidate. Done effectively the process is largely invisible to the voter who is led to believe their ballot was cast according to their wishes.  Because of tactics like these my office has conducted over 300 investigations of mailin ballot fraud. Our investigators have spoken with thousands of victims of mail ballot fraud over the years and they commonly tell us they were pressured and harassed by campaign workers to sign up to vote by mail vote a certain way or hand over their ballots. The common denominator in mail ballot fraud is that the votes of the victims are cancelled and replaced by those of paid campaign workers. Every fraudulent vote disenfranchises a lawful voter by canceling out their lawful vote. Politicallymotivated groups want to scare us into allowing what amounts to unlimited vote by mail. In doing so they are stealing your right to vote. Democrats distract the public with talk of foreign involvement in our elections while they are brazenly creating election interference themselves. If we willfully compromise the integrity of our election process we are threatening the future of our country as we know it. Let s work together to stop them and keep our elections safe fair and honest. The Office of the Attorney General OAG today filed a Notice of Accelerated Interlocutory Appeal directly to the Texas Supreme Court under Texas Government Code section 22.001c in Harris County v. State of Texas et al.  Attorney General Paxton has secured another major victory for election integrity after the New Orleansbased U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit issued an opinion in favor of Paxton and a Texas law aimed at securing our elections.  Attorney General Ken Paxton issued a Civil Investigative Demand CID to the Center for Tech and Civil Life CTCL as part of an investigation to determine whether the nonprofit solicited donations under the pretext of protecting voters from Covid19 while instead using the funds to support partisan electioneering efforts or election oversight roles normally left to state and local officials.

https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voting-mail-and-absentee-voting, The movement to vote by mail reached new levels with the 2020 elections and the COVID19 pandemic and although it subsequently declined by more than 10 points in 2022 32 percent of voters chose to cast their ballots this way in that election. This explainer was last updated on February 28 2024. Absentee voting and balloting by mail have generally been viewed as synonymous in the United States because historically absentee ballots were distributed by mail to voters temporarily away from their homes and typically no one else was allowed to use this mode of voting. For this reason both topics are considered together in this explainer. The figure below shows the percentage of voters who cast their ballots since 1996 by each of the three major modes of voting in person on Election Day in person before Election Day and by mailabsentee. The statistics are based on selfreports by respondents to the Voting and Registration Supplement of the Current Population Survey CPS. The data for 2020 are based on responses to the Survey of the Performance of American Elections. The rise in voting by mail VBM raises several important academic and policy issues. Do generous votebymail policies increase turnout? Does an increased rate of voting by mail decrease civic engagement or decrease the impact of an October surprise that is an event at the end of a political campaign intended to affect the outcome? How does the process of counting votes cast by mail impact when we know the winners of an election? The idea that ballots could be cast anywhere other than a physical precinct close to a voter s home hasn t always been embraced in the United States and still isn t in many other countries. What we in the U.S. now call absentee voting first arose during the Civil War when Union and Confederate soldiers were allowed to cast ballots from their battlefield units and have them be counted back home. The issue of absentee voting next became a major issue during World War II when Congress passed laws in 1942 and 1944 related to soldiers stationed overseas. Both laws became embroiled in controversies over states rights and the voting rights of African Americans in southern states so their effectiveness was muted. Subsequent laws particularly the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act UOCAVA and the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment MOVE Act have been more effective in encouraging voting by active service members through absentee voting. States began passing absentee ballot laws for civilians in the late 1800s. The first laws were intended to accommodate voters who were away from home or seriously ill on Election Day. The number of absentee ballots distributed was relatively small and the administrative apparatus was not designed to distribute a significant number. In the 1980s California became the first state to allow eligible voters to request absentee ballots for any reason at all including their convenience. By 2023 28 states and the District of Columbia adopted noexcuse absentee laws. The figure below classifies states according to their absenteemail ballot regimes. According to data in the 2022 Election Administration and Voting Survey EAVS an average of 23.3 of voters in noexcuse states cast their ballots by mail compared to an average of 5.4 in states that still required an excuse. Ever since California instituted noexcuse absentee voting twentyeight states have taken the next step and allowed all residents to request an absentee ballot for every election. These permanent absentee states now have even greater use of absentee ballots. In 2022 the Survey of the Performance of American Elections SPAE reported that over 85 of voters in Washington Oregon Colorado Hawaii and Utah all states with permanent absentee laws voted with an absentee ballot. The next wave in the expansion of voting by mail occurred during the 2020 election season in which many states temporarily altered their absenteemail ballot laws to grant greater access to mail balloting during the COVID19 pandemic. The result was a significant increase in voting by mail for 2020 reflected clearly in the first figure above. In a referendum that passed in 1998 Oregon went a step further than California by agreeing to issue all its ballots by mail. Washington followed suit in 2011 and Colorado in 2013. More recently these states were joined by Hawaii and Utah which passed laws to begin voting by mail permanently with the 2020 election. While they have not made the complete switch to an allvotebymail system California D.C. Nevada New Jersey and Vermont mailed ballots to all voters in 2020 as a COVIDrelated adaptation. In the same year Montana allowed counties to decide whether to mail ballots to all registered voters in their county. Its important to note that although Colorado Oregon Washington Hawaii and Utah now distribute all their ballots by mail voters do not return them all by mail. According to responses to the 2022 SPAE 21 of mail ballots were returned to some physical location such as a drop box or local election office. Thus its more accurate to describe these states as distribute ballots by mail states. The expanding opportunities to cast an absentee ballot or to vote by mail have not been uncontroversial. Perhaps the most important issues have been the question of whether expanding VBM opportunities increases voter turnout and concerns over electoral integrity.  Facilitating VBM presumably reduces the costs of voting for most citizens so one would expect it to increase turnout yet the scientific literature on this empirical question about turnout has been mixed. An early study of the effects of VBM on turnout in Oregon argued that its implementation had caused turnout to increase by 10. However subsequent research has had difficulty replicating these initial findings. More recent research using a variety of quasiexperimental methods suggests the causal effect of VBM in these states in presidential election years is around 2 percentage points although it may be as high as 8 points in Colorado. The safest conclusion to draw is that extending VBM options increases turnout modestly in midterm and presidential elections but may increase turnout more in primaries local elections and special elections. This modest increase likely comes in two ways by bringing marginal voters into the electorate and by retaining voters who might otherwise drop out of the electorate. Another question surrounding VBM is whether it increases voter fraud. Two major features of VBM raise these concerns. First the ballot is cast outside the public eye and thus the opportunities for coercion and voter impersonation are greater. Second the transmission path for VBM ballots is not as secure as traditional inperson ballots. These security concerns relate both to ballots being intercepted and ballots being requested without the voter s permission. As with all forms of voter fraud documented instances of fraud related to VBM are rare. However even many scholars who argue that fraud is generally rare agree that fraud with VBM voting seems to be more frequent than with inperson voting. Two of the bestknown cases of voter fraud involving absentee voting occurred in 1997 in Georgia and Miami. More recently a political campaign manager within North Carolina s ninth Congressional district defrauded voters by collecting unfilled ballots and then filling in the rest of it to favor the campaign s candidate leading to a new election. Finally skeptics of convenience voting methods such as VBM argue that they encourage voters to cast their ballots before all the information from the campaign is revealed thus putting early voters at a civic disadvantage. In response as more voters cast early ballots by mail or in person campaigns have less incentive to hold onto negative information about their opponents in the hope of gaining an advantage through an October surprise. Empirically its important to note that the earliest voters tend to be the strongest partisans and thus less likely to be swayed by lastminute information. Absher Samuel and Jennifer Kavanagh. 2023.
