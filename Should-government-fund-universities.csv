The federal government should at least do no harm when it comes to helping students attain a college degree. Instead through student loans our tax money is used to prop up institutions that are more predatory than educational forprofit educational institutions. These institutions charge their mostly lowincome students so much for so little that the federal government s involvement amounts to exploitation. Too often these institutions aim to make money ahead of their duty to educate students. Their aggressive sales tactics convince vulnerable individuals to sink into debt for a degree that is less usable and more expensive than an equivalent degree from a community college or fouryear institution. That is if students attain a degree at all. The fact is most don t. Only 30.7 percent students entering fouryear forprofit institutions complete their degrees in six years. Their education is often a failed promise. By contrast 48.7 percent of students at public fouryear institutions and 58.5 percent of students at private nonprofit fouryear institutions complete their degrees within six years. The numbers are even worse for Pell Grant receipts who enter fouryear forprofit institutions 27.9 percent of whom complete their degrees in six years. These dismal outcomes are more troubling because many of these students are low income or first generation often coming from families with little or no college experience. Forprofit colleges disproportionately enroll recipients of federal grants including Pell Grants. Of all the students attending fouryear forprofit institutions in 2019 20 69.2 percent were federal grant recipients. This is about 20 percentage points higher than the proportion of students receiving federal grants at public fouryear institutions. Marketing ploys convince students with fewer resources or little family support to attend forprofit institutions. They see the promised education as the key to entering the middle class. Yet all too often all those students attain from the experience is eyepopping debt that makes them worse off financially not better. Students at fouryear forprofits borrow far more than those at fouryear nonprofit institutions. About 87 percent of students who graduated in 2015 16 with bachelor s degrees from forprofit colleges took out student loans compared to 66 percent at public institutions among those borrowers at forprofit institutions the average borrowed for bachelor s degree completers was 44610 compared to 34430 at private nonprofits and 29070 at public nonprofits. The cost is breathtaking. Too many of these students fall into enormous debt for a substandard education. Yet our government continues to allow 704 forprofit institutions in our nation to administer student loans to the 787811 students who attend. Our tax money should not be used this way. The federal government should pull out of giving students loans to attend forprofit colleges. These institutions are not providing a public service and their outcomes and degreeattainment data have proven that the government should not support costly speculative higher education institutions when students lives are on the line. At the minimum the government should develop stricter laws and regulations based on the success of the few forprofit institutions that do get it right. Forprofits will object to ending student loans for their institutions. They will say that they are marketdriven more flexible than traditional colleges and offer students practical classroom learning to enable them to work in the real world. They may even say that their marketbased approach will inspire creativity efficiency and effectiveness to satisfy shareholders and consumers. But if they are so marketdriven and proud of their role in our capitalist system they shouldn t need the federal government to continue to prop them up with student loans. They shouldn t rely on making money by trapping students in debt. They should be entirely marketdriven and make money on the strength of their product like every other business in America. As we all know if your product fails your business will close. Let these forprofit colleges stand or fail on their own merits without federal help. The federal government has acted to forgive student loan debt from students who attended defunct forprofit institutions. However continuing subsidies to enable other forprofit institutions to continue failing students is an insult to taxpayers. It is also a gross disservice to students who only wish to better themselves through education. It s time the government stood with students not those who exploit them.

Federal investments in universities affected over 3000 schools including 17.5 million graduate and undergraduate students.  Updated on Tue March 28 2023 by the USAFacts Team In 2018 federal money made up 14 of all college revenue. About 3.6 of total federal spending went towards higher education investments according to the US government s Datalab. Datalab operates under the Department of Treasury and is a public source for federal spending data. Colleges and universities received 1.068 trillion in revenue from federal and nonfederal funding sources in 2018. The federal government directed 65 of its 149 billion investments to federal student aid which covers scholarships workstudy and loans given to students for their educational expenses. Federal grants at universities received 27 of the total investment or 41 billion from the federal government in 2018. Grants are a form of financial assistance given to individuals or organizations to fund research and projects that contribute to the public good according to Datalab. The last 8 of federal investment in higher education was for contracts. Federal contracts are agreements where the government purchases a good or service from an organization such as a university or an individual for government use. Federal grants often fund university research and development labs. Public institutions typically report Pell grants as revenues from federal grants and as allowances that reduce tuition and fee revenue. Private institutions typically report Pell grants as revenues from tuition and fees rather than as federal grant revenue according to the Department of Education. Outside of financial aid to help college students pay for educational expenses government agencies fund research and development through university laboratories and special departments. Medicine environment agriculture and general science and technology are a few examples of fields federal government agencies fund via contracts and grants. Unbiased datadriven insights in your inbox each week The National Science Foundation awarded 11.2 billion to universities the second largest federal investment in higher education institutions in the 20182019 school year. Most of the grant money went towards expanding science engineering and mathematics education and research according to Datalab. A little less than half of all federal grant money was for university medical research and development. Biomedical research and research training was the largest funded medical research and development category in 2018 followed by aging research. Harvard University received the largest federal grant 179 million from the National Institute of Health. Columbia University received the second largest grant 165 million invested from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Over 30 of federal contracts were dedicated to space research and development projects. California Institute of Technology received 2.4 billion in federal contract funding from NASA. This federal contract with California Institute of Technology was 24 of all federal investments in government contracts with universities. Hawaii Alaska and Vermont public universities had the largest revenues from federal grant and contract investments per student enrolled in public colleges and universities according to the Department of Education. California Texas and Michigan public universities were the top recipients of federal grant and contract money in 2018 receiving a quarter of federal grant and contract revenue across all public universities.

https://www.lovetoknow.com/parenting/adulting/should-governments-help-pay-college,  Learn about our Editorial Policy.  Should government money be invested in the future? How would you answer the following question should governments help pay for college? This is a controversial issue not only in education but also in economics. Most adults who are returning to college would leap at the opportunity of a governmentsubsidized education. However students fresh out of high school might not recognize the benefit of governmentfinanced classes and create frivolous costs.  On the yes side of the argument education is the only way to maintain a technological and developmental advantage over other nations. Higher education equals higher salaries and more opportunities. The problem is that the average cost of higher education is 87000 to 115000 for four years at a state university. Graduate programs will increase the cost and these figures are based on 2006 estimates each year the cost continues to rise.  While taxpayers would carry the burden initially government support of a college education can help eliminate the need for welfare. It can also help reduce the levels of family or classrelated poverty. Children of college graduates typically attend college. The average family cannot afford the constantly rising cost of college unless the parents themselves are college graduates.  Taxpayers support the education of convicted criminals who undergo rehabilitation in prison earn high school and college degrees and may even graduate law school while behind bars. If the government can pay for a criminals education shouldnt the government pay for the education of people who have never committed a crime?  College educations are optional and it takes a family and a community to create the right situation for students to go to college. Numerous scholarship opportunities along with grants and student loans are available. Students who receive a free ride are also less likely to value the education versus having to work for it. This is an unfortunate byproduct of human nature. Many selfmade millionaires made their fortunes without graduating high school much less college. The desire to succeed is the driving force with college being just one more tool in a students arsenal. If the government pays for education the government can also institute testing to determine what a students best options are and from there assign jobs. While this is speculative at best turning over a persons individual future for a college tuition check is not necessarily the plan that supports freedom of choice.  The United States government already offers to pay for college for students who enlist in the military and serve their country. Military service and the G.I. Bill ensure that those who risk giving up their lives to protect their country are amply rewarded. In many other countries government service also provides a government paycheck and subsidization of education and more. Governmentfunded grant and loan programs also pay the way for many college students.  Going to college may not be optional but it remains a privilege that should be earned and should require sacrifice. Unfortunately one must only look at the public school system to see how easy it is to take the educational system for granted. The next time you wonder Should governments help pay for college? hopefully you can now better understand the complexities of the issue.
https://imprimis.hillsdale.edu/how-government-funding-is-destroying-american-higher-education/, American higher education is a perfect example. In the 1960s the total budget for all U.S. colleges and universities was about 7 billion in the early 1990s largely because of massive state and federal funding increases it surpassed 170 billion. Yet tens of thousands of college seniors do not know when Columbus sailed to the New World who wrote the Declaration of Independence or why the Civil War was fought. Businesses rightly complain that they must reeducate college graduates in such basic academic skills as grammar spelling and practical math. The effect of government subsidy and control has been more profound more direct and more damaging than anyone has yet realized. It has led to a situation in which the entire system of American higher education is academically morally and quite literally going bankrupt. One of the bestkept secrets in American higher education today is that many colleges and universities are teetering on the brink of disaster. Nearly onehalf of the college presidents polled by U.S. News World Report in the early 1990s said their institutions would face continuing deficits and nearly onethird said they did not expect to balance their budgets anytime in this decade. Nearly 60 percent of all colleges and universities have been forced to slash their budgets. Even some schools with huge endowments and hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in the form of federal research grants have been starving for operating funds. The reason? The bigger the institution the bigger the outlays. Harvard University Stanford University Columbia University MIT and the University of Michigan are just a few of the institutions that rack up bills of more than 1 billion a year. And little of what they spend can be called discretionary they are overcommitted to entitlements in exactly the same way as is the federal government. There will be no easy way out of this crisis. Private donations to colleges and universities have gone up in the last decade but even at best corporate and private giving only accounts for 8 percent of all higher education revenues. And federal and state aid which has grown by leaps and bounds since World War II is on the decline. Defaults on student loans have exploded. The tab taxpayers must pick up for Stafford Loan defaults alone is now about 3 billion a year. Moreover defaults mismanagement fraud and abuse due to internal control weaknesses within the Stafford Loan program are eating up in excess of 54 percent of total program costs. This means that less than half the money allocated for Stafford Loans goes to pay for new loans. Record deficits in the Pell Grant program also testify to the failure of the system. By the end of the Bush administration this federal program was in debt to the tune of 2 billion. What we are seeing today is an S L style financial crisis Although higher education appears thriving and prosperous on the surface vast instability and corruption lie just below. The question is how long can the veneer last? What finally broke the savings and loan institutions was a combination of bureaucratic meddling a credit crunch after years of easy money and the industry s own chronic mismanagement and massive overinvestment. That combination is precisely what threatens colleges and universities today. But our nation s politicians will be the last people on earth to recognize that they have created this crisis. Indeed they are busy devising ways to make it worse. Despite the fact that the Department of Education has been a complete failure when it comes to managing federal student assistance programs Congress has decided to give it total responsibility not only for monitoring but for making some six million loans a year. Under this new system the federal government instead of banks and other private lenders will lend money directly to college students. Congress has also decided to raise the ceiling on individual grants and loans in some cases by nearly 50 percent. In addition it has abandoned financial need requirements for Stafford Loans. This means that all students who apply are eligible. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that under the new rules of eligibility there will be at least 1.1 million new borrowers and 1.4 million new grant recipients. From where will the money come? Your guess is as good as anyone s. Less than two months after it passed this new legislation Congress admitted that it would not have the budget to pay for any of it. President Clinton has said that he plans to spend billions more dollars on grants and loans and on new educational schemes like national service. It is becoming increasingly clear however that he will not be able to deliver on his grand promises since higher education s financial troubles are already overshadowed by the federal government s four and onehalf trillion dollar debt. Meanwhile the financial condition on campuses around the country is steadily worsening. College costs are outofcontrol They have grown nearly three times as fast as inflation and twice as fast as the general economy. At Harvard the total cost of attending for four years is now pushing 100000. Why have college costs gone up? One reason is because Washington D.C. is heavily subsidizing tuitions through federal grants and loans. This leaves colleges and universities free to jack up their prices. Who cares after all what tuition is at Harvard University when nearly twothirds of its undergraduates receive financial assistance? It is true that rising tuition also places a huge financial burden on students and parents but what they pay doesn t begin to cover the actual costs of a college education. At private institutions tuition and fees only cover onehalf to twothirds of actual costs. At public institutions they cover far less only about onequarter to onethird. The rest of the costs are passed along to you and me as taxpayers. And those costs are going up and up and up. Heavily financed by federal and state aid colleges and universities have indulged in a spending spree in the last halfcentury that has no equal in American history. As one education consultant notes in an era when quality was defined as moreisbetter and when there seemed to be endless amounts of government funding to pay for it colleges and universities grew without a thought for the ordinary laws of supply and demand. Budgeting was right at the margin. The only important question seemed to be How much more can we do next year? How much money had already been spent and what results had been achieved he notes were only secondary concerns. If that were all to report about the crisis that presently afflicts American higher education it would be devastating enough. But there is more much more. The crisis is not just about finances it is about academics and finally it is about morality too. Concerning the academic crisis Colleges and universities have increasingly adopted a cattle car approach to education. Classes crammed with 500 to 1000 students are now commonplace. And many colleges have drastically reduced the number of classes they offer. The University of Wisconsin has been known to close courses in the first hour of registration even for seniors in their major field of concentration. At the University of Texas nearly 1000 students were turned away from a required English course. A recent study tracking the education of over half a million students at 300 institutions documented that only about half were able to earn a bachelor s degree within six years. One educator admits candidly that this is a condemnation of higher education. If we were running an automobile plant we would be out of business.  The average professor is in class only six to nine hours a week. At the University of Michigan some professors teach so little that it is estimated that they make nearly 1000 an hour for their actual contact with students. In the last few years teaching assistants rather than faculty have taught 25 50 or even 75 percent of all introductory classes at schools such as Princeton University the University of North Carolina Ohio State University Stanford University and the University of CaliforniaBerkeley. In his bestselling book Profscam education critic Charles Sykes also points out that professors don t really do as much research as they claim and that much of the research that is done actually has little merit. Sixty percent of all college faculty members have never written or edited a book and onethird have never even published a single journal article. The faculty books that do make it into print range from the sublimely ridiculous to the sublimely obscure. This is just a small taste of some of the titles currently in print The Sexual Politics of Meat Critical FeministVegetarian Theory Mama Lola A Voodoo Priestess in Brooklyn Boots of Leather Slippers of Gold The History of a Lesbian Community Staying Tuned. Contemporary Soap Opera Criticism and Men Women and Chainsaws Gender in the Modern Horror Film. Yet the leaders of higher education are adamant that they need more financial support in order to pay top dollar for the best faculties money can buy. In its current campaign for example Cornell University is asking alumni and other donors for more than 400 million to endow professorships that in all likelihood will have zero effect on the school s undergraduate program. Michigan State University which receives more than 230 million a year from the state treasury says it needs millions more in government aid to face the teaching challenges of the future. This is pretty hard to swallow especially coming from a school that uses a video to teach about six thousand students each year in a required history course called The United States and the World. Its professors among the most well paid in the nation are just too busy to perform live. It is no wonder that author Midge Decter concludes that undergraduate education is the biggest consumer fraud in America.  But it is the moral crisis in American higher education that makes all other crises pale in comparison. There has been a concerted effort to destroy colleges and universities in loco parentis role. Ask almost any educator and he will tell you that his students morals and personal conduct are no longer his concern. But it is perfectly all right for educators to meddle as much as they want when it comes to introducing students to the sexual revolution on campus. There are Condom Weeks at a number of colleges including Stanford Berkeley San Jose State Virginia Tech the University of Iowa and the University of North Carolina complete with free samples and something called taste tests. At Williams College Mills College Randolph Macon College and the Florida Institute of Technology to name just a few examples male and female students can now spend the night in each other s rooms. At schools like Pennsylvania State University the official policy is that students may not be granted a room change on the grounds that their roommate is homosexual. Columbia Harvard Middlebury College MIT Stanford the University of Minnesota the University of Vermont and Yale already have domestic partner provisions that allow gay and lesbian couples to receive insurance and other spousal benefits. Not every school has volunteered however. The University of Vermont has been ordered by the state labor relations board to offer those benefits. The University of MassachusettsAmherst has defined pedophiles i.e. persons who have sex with children as a protected minority within its nondiscrimination code. At Cornell University resident advisor job applicants have been forced to watch movies of men engaged in sex in order to be evaluated for homophobic tendencies. Another byproduct of the abandonment of morality on campus is the soaring crime rate. On 580 campuses between 1990 and 1992 there were 2528 assaults 15313 burglaries 5081 car thefts 928 robberies 493 rapes and 16 murders. Plagiarism and other forms of cheating are also on the rise. Despite the dumbing down of the curriculum passfail courses grade inflation and all the rest it is estimated that at least half of all college students cheat. Although today s colleges and universities look much like large business corporations with thousands of employees i.e. faculty and staff and millions of customers i.e. students and parents they are not organized or run like a business. Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Martin Anderson calls them minisocialist states. That s true Modern higher education not only has pursued an intellectual love affair with socialism but along the way it has adopted its basic principles of internal management. Since the 1960s much of the control of institutional as well as academic affairs has shifted from the bourgeoisie i.e. administrators to the proletariat i.e. faculty members. Federal funding has financed this shift every step of the way. It has also led to the breakdown of effective decision making the tyranny of the majority and control without accountability for both groups. Now however the chickens are coming home to roost. Administrators and faculty members alike have to face the fact that they cannot count on continually expanding sources of state and federal revenue. And they have to perform some of their basic missions better than in the past if they are to survive. But if you ask most educators they will continue to insist that only more government money can save American higher education. It is tempting to reach such a conclusion. Government money is such easy money. There are literally hundreds of inducements to accept it and it always appears at first to be free money without any strings attached. Heaven knows there are plenty of politicians and bureaucrats who will claim that this is so. Don t believe them. Nothing comes dearer than free money. Hundreds of private colleges and universities have learned in recent years that even indirect aid that is aid that goes to their students makes them wards of the state as far as the government is concerned. In addition to the way it wrongly compromises the independence of private institutions government funding is also destructive because it wrongly shields colleges and universities from the normal healthy forces of the marketplace. It eliminates competition which is the only incentive to practice good fiscal stewardship and remain responsive to issues of quality affordability and equal access. The best news of all may be that colleges and universities are in financial trouble. More money didn t bail out the failing S Ls in the 1980s they simply misspent it in the same ways they had been misspending for years. Failing businesses only recover when they engage in a fundamental restructuring of the way they do business. It s up to us as parents as donors and as taxpayers to convince educators that they must embrace real reform. We must lead the fight for the restoration of the values of the marketplace as well as the academic and moral values that ought to be the foundation of all higher education.

Rudy Professor Department of Sociology Indiana University brianpowelliu April 14 2022 Governance Studies Brown Center on Education Policy Studentloan debt is top of mind for many Americans these days. Americans cumulatively owe about 1.75 trillion in student loans and federal loans account for about 93 of that total. The potential for debt cancellation which has been floated by many policymakers economists and student advocates could help provide lifechanging economic relief for millions of U.S. households. Discussions of debt cancellation as well as of free tuition and other proposals to make college more accessible are fundamentally a question of responsibility. Should individuals such as students and their parents be on their own in paying for higher education or should the government assume some or all of this responsibility? Americans have grappled with the notion of responsibility for college costs for decades. We see this in television segments about whether and how parents should pay for their children s college in advice columns asking how much is too much when it comes to spending on tuition in films when the main characters wonder how they will ever pay for their degrees. These discussions and portrayals ultimately ask who should be responsible for the funding of college. We have heard from the media pop culture scholars and policymakers on this basic question. But where does the public stand? Over the past decade we along with our research team have conducted telephone interviews with American adults to gauge public opinion on the funding of college. We worked with the Center for Survey Research at Indiana University to interview a nationally representative sample of about 1600 respondents and we incorporated both closed and openended questions that capture multiple data points on this issue. These responses are reported in our new book Who Should Pay? Higher Education Responsibility and the Public published by the Russell Sage Foundation. In our interviews we begin with two simple questions. The first question is who should have the main responsibility for the cost of education beyond high school whether it should be students parents the federal government or the state or local government. The second question is who should have the secondmost responsibility given these same response options. Looking at the answers to these questions side by side gives us a sense of how people think about the issue of responsibility. Some people are individualists. They think that parents and students should pay for college with few contributions from the government. Others are collectivists. They think that the federal and state or local governments should bear most of the responsibility for college with less reliance on individual funds. Others still advocate for a shared responsibility in which individuals and government act as partners parents and students shoulder some of the cost and government pays some as well. What we found initially was quite clear When we started conducting our interviews in 2010 Americans overwhelmingly believed that parents and students should pay for college at approximately twothirds 65 of the sample. This made sense to us. Americans are individualistic at their core and the notion of parental funding for college is baked into financialaid forms. When one of us conducted similar analyses of federal data from the 1980s the same pattern was evident. The American preference for individualism looked rocksolid over a period of decades and we assumed that it would not change. But starting in 2015 and in the years since we have documented a dramatic shift in how Americans answer these questions as shown in Figure 1. In interviews from 2015 the public was evenly split at 50 each between those who prefer an individualist solution on the left and those who say that government should have the most or secondmost responsibility for the funding of college combining the three response combinations on the right. Note that these changes in public opinion occurred despite our using similar nationally representative samples in both surveys as well as identical question wordings. A recent national online survey that we fielded in 2019 with over 1200 Americans suggests a continuing realignment in public opinion toward collective or shared responsibility. Our surveys also show that these views map closely with opinion regarding free community college andor free tuition at public universities. These data represent a massive shift in public opinion in a very short period of time. Social scientists have made a convincing case that public opinion as a general rule is very slow to change. Some social scientists have even made the argument that people generally do not change their opinions about social issues instead many changes in public opinion are attributable to older generations dying off and being replaced by those with more progressive attitudes a phenomenon referred to as cohort replacement . Our interviews however suggest a fundamental shift in public opinion regarding the funding of college. The words of our interviewees help pinpoint some of the factors behind the change. In the 2010s Americans faced so many challenges in paying for college including high college costs staggering student debt the lingering economic fallout from the recession and rising inequality to list just a few issues that our respondents cited in their interviews that the public is now more supportive of government responsibility than ever before. This was also a period when we saw expanded government coverage of health insurance through the Affordable Care Act ACA of 2010. In fact several interviewees brought up the ACA as an example of how the government should be involved in breadandbutter issues that affect people s daily lives. The increasing shift in health care from an individualist approach to a more collectivist approach and the accompanying discussion of health care as a right versus a privilege may have been carried over to affect people s beliefs about higher education. As we noted the public is about evenly split between those who do and do not want the government to bear responsibility for the funding of college. Some people may see this 5050 split and bemoan the polarization of America on yet another contentious social issue. But we see this polarization as an encouraging sign of social change. The dramatic and swift change in public opinion regarding samesex marriage is a useful parallel. Data from the General Social Survey the gold standard for survey research show that less than onethird 31 of all Americans supported samesex marriage in 2004. By 2010 Americans were approximately split down the middle in their support and opposition toward samesex marriage. Note that these numbers are a mirror image of what we find regarding the funding of college. By 2018 support for samesex marriage increased to more than twothirds 68. Over this time period Americans shifted rapidly from a more conservative consensus to a state of polarization until finally coalescing around a more progressive consensus. Given the tenor of debates over debt cancellation and free tuition it seems that public opinion on the funding of college may be trending in a similar direction. Americans want college to be more affordable and they want government to contribute much more substantially to these costs.  Douglas N.

Tyler Cowen drove a lot of traffic to my piece critiquing his thinking on higher education. All it took was Cowen posting a twosentence comment on Marginal Revolution Joshua Kim comment on my higher education worries. I think he is saying they don t get enough money!? Good. Let s get to the heart of the disagreement about the place that higher education should play in our country. I m arguing and would learn from hearing the counterargument that publicserving higher education should be treated as a public good. Postsecondary institutions whose mission and operations are optimized to educate train and credential learners community colleges landgrant institutions comprehensive regional public universities HBCUs and other minorityserving institutions come to mind should get more public money. Where should that public money come from? Three words tax the rich. The marginal tax rate on highincome earners should go up and some of that money should go to publicserving colleges and universities. Today the marginal tax rate for single filers in the highest taxable income bracket 578126 or more is 37 percent. That is down from 92 percent in 1952. There is plenty of room to raise taxes on the highestincome earners to free up some money to invest in publicserving higher education. Even better let s adopt Senator Elizabeth Warren s plan UltraMillionaire tax plan. That proposal would introduce a 2 percent tax on households on every dollar of net worth above 50 million and a 6 percent tax on every dollar of net worth above 1 billion. Wealth is so highly concentrated in the U.S. that this tax would only impact 75000 households but produce 3.75 trillion in new revenue over a 10year period. A 2020 Center for American Progress report estimated that community colleges face an annual funding shortfall of 78 billion. On average community colleges receive 8800 less in education revenue per student than fouryear institutions. The reason for this funding gap is that states provide much less money to community colleges than fouryear schools and that students pay much less to attend. As states will not or cannot raise taxes to adequately fund community colleges the federal government could step in to make up the shortfall. These dollars could be easily generated by instituting a wealth tax on the wealthiest 0.1 percent of households. How much good could community colleges do with an extra 78 billion each year? The trend of statelevel disinvestment from higher education is wellknown. A recent NEA study found that 32 states spent less on public colleges and universities in 2020 than in 2008. That public funding shortfall has primarily been made up by an increase in the amount of money that students and their families spend to pay for tuition with the predictable result being a student debt crisis. Let s stop waiting for the states to restore funding for publicserving colleges and universities and instead focus on new federal dollars made available through taxes on the wealthy. Two counterarguments there are many more to raising taxes on the wealthy and allocating those funds to publicserving institutions are a higher education should be considered a private good or b higher taxes on the rich are always and everywhere a bad idea. Suppose we could set aside all the arguments about the wisdom of taxing the rich. Can we at least agree that community colleges and other publicserving colleges and universities should get more money? Can anyone make an argument as to why the top 0.1 percent of households should control almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? While at the same time publicserving institutions like community colleges should lack the funds to provide a quality postsecondary education to anyone seeking that opportunity? Tell me why it is a bad idea to raise taxes on rich people and send that money to our most cashstrapped but most impactful publicserving colleges and universities. This is a straightforward argument designed to get a conversation going. Taxing the wealthy equals more money for publicserving colleges and universities. What I want to see happen is less money for rich people and more money for community colleges comprehensive regional publics and other schools that offer degrees for a reasonable cost to lower and middleincome students. How is that not a good idea? I d like to understand. The Seder liturgy reminds us that too many colleges are creating students who don t know how to ask a question Rache Understanding how the infrastructural systems that enable our campuses to run are dependent on stable climate.

https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2019/10/two-decades-of-change-in-federal-and-state-higher-education-funding, Getty Images Overview States and the federal government have long provided substantial financial support for higher education but in recent years their respective levels of contribution have shifted significantly.Pew s analysis of data from the Delta Cost Project Database accessed July 2018 based on original data from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System. This analysis reflects federal and state revenue reported by higher education institutions including funding from financial aid grants research grants and generalpurpose appropriations and excluding loans and tax expenditures. Available data go back to 1987. Ibid. This chartbook uses the terms postsecondary education and higher education interchangeably. This swing in federal and state funding has altered the level of public support directed to students and institutions and how higher education dollars flow. Although federal and state governments have overlapping policy goals such as increasing access to postsecondary education and supporting research they channel their resources into the higher education system in different ways. The federal government mainly provides financial assistance to individual students and specific research projects while states primarily pay for the general operations of public institutions. Federal and state funding together continue to make up a substantial share of public college and university budgets at 34 percent of public schools total revenue in 2017. Given the essential role that government funding plays in higher education access and operations policymakers across the nation frequently face difficult choices as they seek to balance support for postsecondary students and institutions with other priorities and changing economic conditions. Federal leaders for example are debating renewal of the Higher Education Act the law that governs most federal financial aid and which was last reauthorized in 2008.A.

Decisions at both levels of government will affect the federal government s and states ability to achieve shared policy goals such as greater student access to education and support for research and will determine whether the funding convergence that has occurred in recent years is temporary or a more lasting reconfiguration. This chartbook illustrates the existing federalstate relationship in higher education funding how that relationship has evolved over time and the significant variation in federal and state support across states.   1 Pew s analysis of data from the Delta Cost Project Database accessed July 2018 based on original data from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System.

From 2000 to 2015 federal spending per FTE student going to public nonprofit and forprofit institutions grew by almost 24 percent in real terms while comparable state expenditures fell by about 31 percent narrowing the difference between state and federal funding levels from 100 percent to 12 percent over this period.

Source Pew s analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System The total amount and mix of revenue used for public higher education vary across states. PerFTE student revenue flowing to public institutions from federal sources ranges from 3268 in Missouri to 9693 in Hawaii and from state sources it spans between 2769 in Colorado and 20265 in Alaska. Other elements such as the amount of revenue from tuition also vary. Federal funding variation stems from differences in students financial needs and in the types of research conducted in each state among other factors while the range in state funding is due in part to policy choices. For example North Carolina s and Wyoming s constitutions require that public institutions be as close to free as possible so schools in those states receive more state revenue and less net tuition revenue than the average.North Carolina Constitution Article IX 9 and Wyoming Constitution Article 7 16.  16 North Carolina Constitution Article IX 9 and Wyoming Constitution Article 7 16.

During the same 200813 period state appropriations for public postsecondary institutions fell by 13.8 billion or nearly 20 percent in real terms. In an effort to minimize these recessiondriven state education cuts the federal government provided roughly 40 billion between 2009 and 2011 to states to bolster their K12 and higher education spending. To receive this funding states needed to maintain their own education spending at a minimum of 2006 levels and they ultimately spent approximately 8.3 billion of the federal dollars to help sustain support for institutions of higher education.J.

This reflects a familiar pattern Higher education has historically been the area of state budgets most vulnerable to cuts in a downturn but has also tended to receive substantial funding increases as the economy recovers.J.A. Delaney and W.R. Doyle State Spending on Higher Education Testing the Balance Wheel Over Time Journal of Education Finance 36 no. 4 2011 34368 httpseric.ed.gov?idEJ926831. Similarly state appropriations for research and agricultural and medical education had a net decline over the past decade dropping by 2.3 billion or 18 percent from their highs in 2008. By contrast state financial aid funding saw an increase over the decade following the financial crisis rising 1.9 billion in real terms or 21 percent from 2007 to 2017. Although most Pell Grant and research funding flowed to public institutions the money went to different types of schools. Nearly threequarters of federal research funding to public colleges and universities went to only 16 percent of such institutions those classified as doctoral institutions with the highest level of research activity. All federal research funding went to schools that award only fouryear undergraduate degrees or higher.Calculations are based on Pew s analysis of IPEDS Carnegie Classifications of Research Activity and National Science Foundation Higher Education Research and Development Survey Table 5.

For those who aren t familiar with the singular piece of legislation that created the largest export product that the U.S. has the land grant act gave states exclusive rights to buy federal land at low prices for the sole purpose of creating public universities. Ironically this was done in the name of tying together the nation at the height of the Civil War even though the land was largely taken from Native Americans for little to no compensation. Another example of the lessons our schools don t teach us aside what I want to focus on today is amid the Covid19 pandemic how can we effectively facilitate taxpayer funds to lead our schools into the next generation of virtual and blended learning? For those that have 30 minutes to deeply analyze state and federal funding check out this detailed whitepaper from the PEW s research team. Otherwise briefly Ill take you through a breakdown in how this current spending looks like At the moment states across the U.S. are feeling significant budget pressures as a whole and increasingly rely on the federal government to offset these burdens. Poor fiscal planning focused on general upkeep of unchecked education initiates at the state level has arguably left our schools in worse shape yet with an increasing need for federal help. At a crossroads amid Covid19 panic it is clear the federal government is going to have to do even more to save education institutions in the short term and rely on states to help create strategic plans in the long term to help their schools adapt and become fiscally responsible. A few questions before we once again blindly throw money at a problem especially considering Covid19... Focusing on school funding is the best way to help education in the short and long term albeit for two different reasons and two different focuses.  In Ben Miller s piece he is primarily focused on the shortterm stimulus that is needed for higher education to continue on in this pandemic. As detailed above federal funding has increasingly focused more on institutional spending and Mr. Miller takes this a step further by not only increasing it but primarily focusing it on public institutions that states are sorely underfunding. This shortterm solution is clear and while Mr. Miller says may be hard for Congress to approve it is quite necessary. The important longterm result of this however is the strengthening of federal state partnerships regarding funding for education. He states that A partnership involves the federal government giving states greater support for higher education and in exchange the state must increase its funding or in the case of a recession maintain it. States receiving additional funding would also have to address policy issues such as improving access or completion for traditionally undeserved populations.  Mr. Crow Mr. Selingo take this longterm funding approach one step further by introducing a measure to direct federal funding to schools focusing on institutional research and innovation as opposed to Mr. Miller s focus on budgetary and administrative matters. The two Arizona State University officials believe the federal government can come to support universities becoming digital hubs that receive strategic funding to research implement and facilitate online and digital learning at the university in the community and in education across the entire state.  In the spirit of the National Sea Grant 1966 National Space Grant 1987 and National Sun Grant universities 2003 this new Digital Hub grant would help create a new digital education interstate system which we can use for the transport of education across the county and eventually internationally to become a new national asset. This in turn will help drive revenue money in general for these institutions to ease their reliance on general administrative funding and return towards research and innovative focuses. In addition the shortterm benefit of this is obvious to the two authors disrupting education creates monumental problems and by focusing on developing online education this can immediately help schools and students this fall.  Why trust institutions that repeatedly seem to fail us? Dr. Joni Finney introduces a healthy dose of governmental skepticism by making it clear that state funding focuses have not gone according to plan and the federal government needs to initiate change to the current model to better hope those education is supposed to serve the students.  While written in 2014 Dr. Finney concludes that the federal and state government must do more during recessions to help students education needs and in light of Covid19 I m sure she d once again champion this point. In addition funding should not only be directed towards students but should be more targeted based on socioeconomic backgrounds This can create longterm gains by providing a wider subset of the workforce with the proper credentials to thrive in the marketplace while minimizing their financial burdens that force them to put off market participation like major purchases expanding families and leisure spending.  The team at Rutgers Graduate School of Education s Education Law Center takes this one step further by highlighting how states are funding incorrectly and receiving low grades in terms of their financial health and impact on the communities they serve. The authors collectively found that not only are states fiscal efforts towards education related to their state income have been decreasing since 2008 but that the decreasing the fastest are also cutting their funding in the crucial areas of lowincome and high diversity education spending. While not necessarily an argument for individual student spending they adamantly argue that school and state spending has been terribly mismanaged and the federal government needs to help recorrect this issue.  With Covid19 continuing to ravish the country unchecked education will continue to fiscally struggle into the Fall 2020 semester and beyond. As many predict this will force the closing or merging of schools and leave institutions faculty and students vulnerable to the realities of a recession and a freefall global market. While ominous on the surface is this actually the perfect time to strategically implement fiscal measures that both create shortterm gains and longterm revenuepositive foundations? Do these measures focus on schools or students? Maybe the best answer is a happy medium between the two yet couldn t that just complicate the matter and further muddy the timeline and implementation process?  Many topics to unpack here but one thing is for certain schools may need to check down on their avocado toast food options! Or maybe that can be its own specialized line of funding. _________________________________________________________________________  Mark contributions as unhelpful if you find them irrelevant or not valuable to the article.
