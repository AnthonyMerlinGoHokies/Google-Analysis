https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2016/07/01/racial-gender-wage-gaps-persist-in-u-s-despite-some-progress/, Looking at gender race and ethnicity combined all groups with the exception of Asian men lag behind white men in terms of median hourly earnings according to a new Pew Research Center analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. White men are often used in comparisons such as this because they are the largest demographic group in the workforce 33 in 2015. In 2015 average hourly wages for black and Hispanic men were 15 and 14 respectively compared with 21 for white men. Only the hourly earnings of Asian men 24 outpaced those of white men. Among women across all races and ethnicities hourly earnings lag behind those of white men and men in their own racial or ethnic group. But the hourly earnings of Asian and white women 18 and 17 respectively are higher than those of black and Hispanic women 13 and 12 respectively and also higher than those of black and Hispanic men. While the hourly earnings of white men continue to outpace those of women all groups of women have made progress in narrowing this wage gap since 1980 reflecting at least in part a significant increase in the education levels and workforce experience of women over time.  White and Asian women have narrowed the wage gap with white men to a much greater degree than black and Hispanic women. For example white women narrowed the wage gap in median hourly earnings by 22 cents from 1980 when they earned on average 60 cents for every dollar earned by a white man to 2015 when they earned 82 cents. By comparison black women only narrowed that gap by 9 cents from earning 56 cents for every dollar earned by a white man in 1980 to 65 cents today. Asian women followed roughly the trajectory of white women but earned a slightly higher 87 cents per dollar earned by a white man in 2015 whereas Hispanic women fared even worse than black women narrowing the gap by just 5 cents earning 58 cents on the dollar in 2015. Black and Hispanic men for their part have made no progress in narrowing the wage gap with white men since 1980 in part because there have been no improvements in the hourly earnings of white black or Hispanic men over this 35year period. As a result black men earned the same 73 share of white men s hourly earnings in 1980 as they did in 2015 and Hispanic men earned 69 of white men s earnings in 2015 compared with 71 in 1980. To be sure some of these wage gaps can be attributed to the fact that lower shares of blacks and Hispanics are college educated. U.S. workers with a fouryear college degree earn significantly more than those who have not completed college. Among adults ages 25 and older 23 of blacks and 15 of Hispanics have a bachelor s degree or more education compared with 36 of whites and 53 of Asians. However looking just at those with a bachelor s degree or more education wage gaps by gender race and ethnicity persist. Collegeeducated black and Hispanic men earn roughly 80 the hourly wages of white college educated men 25 and 26 vs. 32 respectively. White and Asian collegeeducated women also earn roughly 80 the hourly wages of white collegeeducated men 25 and 27 respectively. However black and Hispanic women with a college degree earn only about 70 the hourly wages of similarly educated white men 23 and 22 respectively. As with workers overall collegeeducated Asian men outearn collegeeducated white men by about 3 per hour of work. What contributes to these persistent wage gaps? Research shows that a majority of each of these gaps can be explained by differences in education labor force experience occupation or industry and other measurable factors. For example NBER researchers Francine Blau and Lawerence Kahn found that education and workforce experience accounted for 8 of the total gender wage gap in 2010 while industry and occupation explained 51 of the difference. When it comes to race sociologists Eric Grodsky and Devah Pager found that education and workforce experience accounted for 52 of the wage gap between black and white men working in the public sector in 1990 and that adding occupational differences explained approximately 20 of the wage gap. And NBER researcher Roland Fryer found that for one group of adults in their 40s controlling for standardizedtest scores reduced the wage gap between black men and white men in 2006 by roughly 70. The remaining gaps not explained by these concrete factors are often attributed at least in part to discrimination. Blau and Kahn point out however that there are both portions of this unmeasured difference that could be due to factors other than discrimination e.g. gender differences in behaviors like risk aversion or negotiation as well as portions of the measured difference that may in fact be due to discrimination e.g. a woman or minority not entering a highpaying STEM field because of experiences that may be rooted in prejudice such as greater encouragement for men than women to pursue these studies. When it comes to racial discrimination in the workplace most Americans 60 say blacks and whites are treated about equally but opinions on this vary considerably across racial and ethnic groups. A new Pew Research Center report finds that roughly twothirds 64 of blacks say black people in the U.S. are generally treated less fairly than whites in the workplace just 22 of whites and 38 of Hispanics agree. About twointen black adults 21 and 16 of Hispanics say that in the past year they have been treated unfairly in hiring pay or promotion because of their race or ethnicity just 4 of white adults say the same. And while 40 of blacks say their race or ethnicity has made it harder for them to succeed in life just 5 of whites and 20 of Hispanics say this. Some 31 of whites say their race or ethnicity has eased the way toward their success. At least sixinten whites 62 and Hispanics 65 and about half of blacks 51 say their race or ethnicity hasn t made much of a difference. For their part about a quarter of women 27 say their gender has made it harder for them to succeed in life compared with just 7 of men. About sixinten men and women say their gender hasn t made much difference but men are much more likely than women to say their gender has made it easier to succeed 30 vs. 8. In addition a 2013 Pew Research Center survey found that about oneinfive women 18 say they have faced gender discrimination at work including 12 who say they have earned less than a man doing the same job because of their gender. By comparison oneinten men say they have faced genderbased workplace discrimination including 3 who say their gender has been a factor in earning lower wages.

Employers can examine their pay policies to root out inequities As employers in the U.S. tackle issues around racism fresh attention is being given to the racial wage gap and why black men and women in particular still earn substantially less than their white counterparts. Nearly 56 years after the passage of the Civil Rights Act we find equal pay for equal work is still not a reality noted Jackson Gruver a data analyst at compensation data and software firm PayScale. Last year PayScale analyzed differences in earnings between white men and men of color using data from a sample of 1.8 million employees surveyed between January 2017 and February 2019. Among the findings Gruver reported Even as black or AfricanAmerican men climb the corporate ladder they still make less than equally qualified white men. They are the only racialethnic group that does not achieve pay parity with white men at some level.  The study found that black men had the largest uncontrolled pay gap relative to white men when comparing the average earnings of black men and white men in the U.S. On average black men earned 87 cents for every dollar a white man earned. Hispanic workers had the next largest gap earning 91 cents for every dollar earned by white men. On the other side of the earnings spectrum Asian men typically earned 1.15 for every dollar earned by a white male worker.   Better news was found in the controlled pay gap a comparison of pay for black and white men with the same experience and education doing the same job in the same geographic location. This approach showed that black men earned 98 cents for every dollar earned by white men with the same qualifications. While that difference may seem small when a 2 percent difference in pay is compounded over the course of a career it adds up to black men taking home significantly less pay than their white male peers.    To put that in perspective the median salary of a white man in our sample is 72900 the controlled median pay for black or AfricanAmerican men is thus 71500 Gruver said. This suggests a 1400 difference in pay that is likely attributable to race.  Gruver attributed much of the racial pay gap to an opportunity gap and occupational segregation.  When we look at the opportunity gap we find men of color have higher rates of holding individual contributor jobs than white men he noted. The study found for instance that a larger percentage of black men 63 percent and Hispanic men 61 percent held individual contributor roles compared with 56 percent of white men who weren t in management. Even when they hold management positions black men are paid less than their white counterparts. Executivelevel black men earned 97 cents for every dollar white men with the same qualifications took home PayScale found. Even more concerning the racial wage gap widened as black men moved up the corporate ladder. This difference may be partly attributable to occupational segregation meaning that black men are more likely to work in industries that generally pay less such as social services in comparison with white men in senior positions Gruver said.  Comparing what women of color are paid to what white nonHispanic men make demonstrates the enormous economic impact of the double burden of sexism and racism wrote Brandie Temple a publicpolicy fellow at the nonprofit National Women s Law Center NWLC and Jasmine Tucker director of research at the organization in an online post. NWLC calculations based on the U.S. Census Bureau s Current Population Survey for 2016 revealed that when comparing all men and women who work full time yearround in the U.S. women were paid just 80 cents for every dollar paid to their male counterparts. But the wage gap was even larger when looking specifically at black women who work full time yearround they were paid only 63 cents for every dollar paid to white nonHispanic men.  This gap which amounts to a loss of 21001 a year means that black women have to work more than 19 months until the very last day of July to make as much as white nonHispanic men did in the previous 12month calendar year Temple and Tucker observed.  Black women who worked full time yearround in lowwage occupations were typically paid about 21700 annually compared to the 36000 typically paid to white nonHispanic men in these occupations NWLC found. This gap translates to a loss of 14300 each year to the wage gap more than enough to pay for an entire year s worth of rent or more than a year and a half of child care costs Temple and Tucker noted. Among workers in highwage occupations such as lawyers engineers and physicians black women who work full time yearround were typically paid about 70000 compared to the 110000 typically paid to white nonHispanic men in the same jobs. This amounts to an annual loss of 40000 each year or 1.6 million over a 40year career. SHRM membersonly toolkit Managing Pay Equity Even after completing undergraduate and graduate degrees black and Hispanic workers earned less than nonHispanic white workers with the same or often less education said Roy Eduardo Kokoyachuk a partner at ThinkNow Research which helps companies respond to the demographic and cultural drivers that influence consumer decisions. In a May 2020 column for the website Market Insider Kokoyachuk wrote that The numbers are sobering. I ran the Census Current Population Survey s 2018 median income levels by race and bachelor s degree attainment and found that black and Hispanic bachelor s degree holders earn nearly a quarter less than Asians and whites with equal levels of education.   While some undergraduate majors lead to higher wages and Asian students were more likely to major in science technology engineering and math STEM subjects for instance that doesn t explain why wage differences exist more broadly Kokoyachuk noted. Even among black and Hispanic workers who have earned professional degrees their incomes still don t break six figures. Whites and Asians however double their incomes by earning professional degrees allowing them to make well over 100000 a year Kokoyachuk said.    NWLC s analysis found that black women with a bachelor s degree were typically paid 46694 just under what white nonHispanic men with only a high school degree were paid 46729. Black women had to earn a master s degree to make slightly more 56072 than white nonHispanic men with just an associate degree 54620. Source NWLC calculations based on U.S. Census Bureau s Current Population Survey 2016 Annual Social and Economic Supplement. Although workers of all races on average earned higher wages in 2018 than in 2000 Kokoyachuk pointed out that at every level of wage distribution the gap between black and white wages was larger in 2018 than it was in 2000 the data showed. The racial wage gap can be overcome he said if policymakers are committed to taking actions such as  Performing pay audits.  Not asking applicants about their past earnings.  Salary history bans do work and are an important component in closing gender and racial pay gaps said Tanya Jansen cofounder of beqom a cloudbased compensation software provider.  Upgrading technology.  While instituting salary bans is progress in the right direction companies should also consider instituting datadriven technology to help automate the compensation decisionmaking process and eliminate unconscious biases from the start of the recruiting and hiring process Jansen said.  Update Beginning in August the U.S. Army will no longer include photos of soldiers on records used to select future officers to help eliminate unconscious biases in its promotionandadvancement process defense officials said on June 25. Because economic outcomes are heavily influenced by social networks Kokoyachuk also advised improving careermentoring programs for minority workers.  For younger workers at the start of their careers these efforts can include creating better opportunities for minority graduates to mingle with or be mentored or sponsored by decisionmakers from other groups he noted. Doing so can help them build up social connections that they can use when seeking higherpaying positions.

President Biden and Vice President Harris have long championed equal pay as a cornerstone of their commitment to ensuring opportunity and fairness for all workers. Closing gender and racial wage gaps is essential to ensuring that women and people of color can fully participate in the labor force. This past year the gender pay gap was the lowest on record. Despite the progress we have made the fight for equal pay continues. Today women workers are still paid on average 84 cents for every dollar paid to men and the disparities are even greater for many women of color. These inequities can add up to millions of dollars lost over the course of a lifetime. The BidenHarris Administration is committed to making the federal government a model employer and closing persistent wage gaps to help grow and strengthen our economy. That s why the President has issued two Executive Orders aimed at advancing pay equity for both the federal workforce and employees of federal contractors. Today to implement those Executive Orders the BidenHarris Administration is announcing new actions to Today s announcements build on previous actions the BidenHarris Administration has taken to close wage gaps and strengthen women s economic security which has led to the lowest unemployment rate among women since 1953. These actions include In addition in April 2023 President Biden signed an Executive Order with more than 50 directives to nearly every cabinetlevel agency to increase access to affordable highquality care and boost job quality for early educators and longterm care workers who are disproportionately women of color. Among the many actions agencies have taken the Department of Health and Human Services has proposed key changes to federal child care assistance to reduce child care payments for nearly 80000 working families.

https://www.epi.org/publication/black-white-wage-gaps-expand-with-rising-wage-inequality/, Report Report By Valerie Wilson and William M. Rodgers III September 20 2016 Download PDF Press release What this report finds Blackwhite wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979 but the increase has not occurred along a straight line. During the early 1980s rising unemployment declining unionization and policies such as the failure to raise the minimum wage and lax enforcement of antidiscrimination laws contributed to the growing blackwhite wage gap. During the late 1990s the gap shrank due in part to tighter labor markets which made discrimination more costly and increases in the minimum wage. Since 2000 the gap has grown again. As of 2015 relative to the average hourly wages of white men with the same education experience metro status and region of residence black men make 22.0 percent less and black women make 34.2 percent less. Black women earn 11.7 percent less than their white female counterparts. The widening gap has not affected everyone equally. Young black women those with 0 to 10 years of experience have been hardest hit since 2000. Why it matters Though the African American experience is not monolithic our research reveals that changes in black education levels or other observable factors are not the primary reason the gaps are growing. For example just completing a bachelor s degree or more will not reduce the blackwhite wage gap. Indeed the gaps have expanded most for college graduates. Black male college graduates both those with just a college degree and those who have gone beyond college newly entering the workforce started the 1980s with less than a 10 percent disadvantage relative to white college graduates but by 2014 similarly educated new entrants were at a roughly 18 percent deficit. What it means for policy Wage gaps are growing primarily because of discrimination or racial differences in skills or worker characteristics that are unobserved or unmeasured in the data and growing earnings inequality in general. Thus closing and eliminating the gaps will require intentional and direct action Income inequality and slow growth in the living standards of low and moderateincome Americans have become defining features of today s economy and at their root is the near stagnation of hourly wage growth for the vast majority of American workers. Since 1979 wages have grown more slowly than productivity a measure of the potential for wage growth for everyone except the top 5 percent of workers while wage growth for the top 1 percent has significantly exceeded the rate of productivity growth Bivens and Mishel 2015. This means that the majority of workers have reaped few of the economic rewards they helped to produce over the last 36 years because a disproportionate share of the benefits have gone to those at the very top. While wage growth lagging behind productivity has affected workers from all demographic groups wage growth for African American workers has been particularly slow. As a result large pay disparities by race have remained unchanged or even expanded. This study describes broad trends and patterns in blackwhite wage inequality and examines the factors driving these trends as the growing wedge between productivity growth and wage growth has emerged. We do so by updating and extending similar analyses that dominated the literature from the 1960s through the 1990s. The analysis is performed for men and women overall as well as by experience and educational attainment during the 1980s 1990s and post2000. In this report the blackwhite wage gap is the percent by which wages of black workers lag wages of their white peers. It is also often expressed in academic and popular literature as an earnings ratio black workers share of white workers earnings by subtracting the gap from 100 percent. Our major contribution to the existing research is an assessment of the pattern or trend in the blackwhite wage gap for men since the late 1990s and for women since the late 1980s. In addition to filling this void in the research on racial wage gaps our analysis also affirms previous studies showing that the blackwhite wage gap among men expanded during the 1980s and narrowed significantly during the 1990s. Our primary finding is that there continues to be no single African American economic narrative. Blackwhite wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979 but the increase has not occurred along a straight line nor has it affected everyone equally. Indeed the post2000 patterns show that the diversity of experiences has expanded. While young black women newly entering the workforce have fallen furthest behind their white counterparts since 2000 the work experience of older African Americans continues to partially insulate them from macroeconomic and structural factors associated with growing racial inequality. However this is cold comfort for members of this older cohort who experienced a major loss in their relative wages during the early 1980s when many of them were first entering the labor market. They have yet to fully recover from the damage of the 1981 1982 recession and the cutbacks in the 1980s to political and financial resources to fight labor market discrimination. We also show that changes in unobservable factors such as racial wage discrimination racial differences in unobserved or unmeasured skills or racial differences in labor force attachment of lessskilled men due to incarceration along with weakened support to fight labor market discrimination continue to be the leading factors for explaining past and now the recent deterioration in the economic position of many African Americans. The main results that support these findings are summarized as follows Our analysis of blackwhite wage gaps proceeds as follows. In Section 2 we place the blackwhite wage gap into the broader context of overall wage trends since 1979. Section 3 describes the literature on blackwhite wage inequality and the contributions of this study. Section 4 describes the data used in this analysis and Section 5 describes broad trends and patterns in blackwhite wage inequality for men and women overall as well as by potential experience and educational attainment. Section 6 breaks down these trends in a detailed analysis that includes regional and industry variations the effects of declining unionization and changing patterns of employment across industries and occupations. Section 7 concludes with an overview of the major themes and policy recommendations. Income inequality and slow growth in the living standards of low and moderateincome Americans have become defining features of today s economy challenging the popular notion that with hard work anyone can get ahead in the United States. At the root of these economic challenges is the near stagnation of hourly wage growth for the vast majority of American workers over the last threeandahalf decades. The salience of these issues is evidenced by the fact that terms like economic inequality stagnant wages and rebuilding the middle class are frequently used in national discourse on the state of the American economy as well as by people in both political parties. The fingerprints of several policy decisions and business practices including eroded labor standards weakened labor market institutions and excessive executive pay growth can be found in the history of wage growth in the past generation Bivens et al. 2014 Bivens and Mishel 2015 Mishel and Eisenbrey 2015. A key measure of the potential for pay increases is productivity growth and since 1979 wages have grown more slowly than productivity for everyone except the top 5 percent of workers while wage growth for the top 1 percent has significantly exceeded the rate of productivity growth. The disconnect between wage and productivity growth means that the majority of workers have reaped few of the economic rewards they helped to produce over the last 36 years because most of the benefits have gone to those at the very top of the wage scale. While this experience has not been limited to any single group of workers African Americans have been disproportionately affected by the growing gap between pay and productivity. Figure A shows that since 1979 median hourly real wage growth has fallen short of productivity growth for all groups of workers regardless of race or gender. At the same time wages for African American men and women have grown more slowly than those of their white counterparts. As a result pay disparities by race and ethnicity have remained unchanged or have expanded. Note Raceethnicity categories are mutually exclusive i.e. white nonHispanic black nonHispanic and Hispanic any race. Source EPI analysis of unpublished Total Economy Productivity data from Bureau of Labor Statistics Labor Productivity and Costs program and Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Table 1 further demonstrates the intersection of class and racial inequality presenting trends in real wages and wage growth at the 10th 50th and 95th percentiles as well as at the mean of the wage distribution by race. We present these data for the business cycle peak years of 1979 1989 2000 and 2007 as well as for 1995 the point during the 1990s business cycle after which wages grew dramatically and for 2015 the last year for which data are available. Note The wage gap is the percent by which black wages lag white wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata One of the reasons that the average blackwhite wage gap has continued to expand is the fact that very few African Americans earn wages that place them among the top 5 percent of all wage earners where most growth has been concentrated. Only 3 percent of all chief executives are African American and a disproportionate number of them are employed in the public or private nonprofit sectors where salaries are lower and more likely to be capped than they are in the private forprofit sector.1 In 2015 the hourly wages of the top 5 percent 95th percentile of black earners was 31.2 percent less than the top 5 percent of white earners corresponding to hourly wages of 42.07 for blacks and 61.12 for whites. These wage gaps are smaller among moderate earners but they don t go away completely. At the 50th percentile median blacks earn 26.2 percent less than whites and at the 10th percentile blacks earn 11.8 percent less than whites. In addition to these racial differences in pay Table 1 also makes clear that over the last 36 years strong wage growth has eluded most workers regardless of race and to the extent that wages have grown at all most of the growth happened in a single episode between 1995 and 2000. In almost every economic cycle preceding and following the late 1990s boom wage growth of black and white low to middlewage earners was either flat or negative. Between 1979 and 2015 wages declined 8.5 percent for blacks in the 10th percentile and grew only 0.7 percent for whites. At the median the wages of blacks grew a meager 1.8 percent while those of whites grew only 11.9 percent. This compares with growth of 36.1 percent and 26.7 percent for 95th percentile whites and blacks respectively. These patterns suggest that addressing the problems of stagnant wages and racial wage inequality has now become a dual imperative. While wage inequality is largely understood as a class issue it is also important to understand how the stagnation of wages for the vast majority of all workers has contributed to measured racial wage inequality. At the same time any effort to fully remedy racial wage gaps in a way that boosts wages and improves living standards for African American families must end the decades of broadbased wage stagnation that has had the most damaging effects on African American workers. This report focuses on trends in blackwhite wage gaps since 1979 including an analysis of the role that growing overall wage inequality has played. The literature on estimating and explaining blackwhite wage inequality has two distinct focuses. During the 1980s and 1990s there was a great deal of attention to trend analysis and understanding of the causes behind the blackwhite wage gap s three distinct periods of change the gap s dramatic narrowing from the late 1960s to the mid1970s the gap s expansion during the 1980s and its narrowing during the late 1990s Bound and Freeman 1992 Juhn Murphy and Pierce 1991 W. Rodgers 2006.2 To our knowledge little trend work has been done since partly due to the perception that there has been little change from 2000 to the present. However we will show otherwise. Researchers also focused on crosssectional analysis in which they used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth NLSY to assess whether the wage gap among a cohort of black and white men in their 20s and 30s was largely due to racial differences in cognitive skills that Current Population Survey CPS and Censusbased trend analysis studies can t control for.3 The NLSY contains a respondent s Armed Forces Qualification Test AFQT score which is introduced as a proxy for cognitive skills Anderson and Shapiro 1996 Conrad 2001 Darity and Mason 1998 England Christopher and Reid 1999 Maxwell 1994 McCrate and Leete 1994 Neal and Johnson 1996 Neal 2004 O Neill 1990 Rodgers and Spriggs 2001. This debate raged for several years but seems to have quieted down. This study revisits the trend analysis that dominated the literature from the 1960s through the 1990s and we update and extend previous studies by examining what has happened to the blackwhite wage gap since the late 1990s. Our analysis affirms that the blackwhite wage gap among men expanded during the 1980s and narrowed significantly during the 1990s. Our contribution is a detailed assessment of what has been the pattern or trend for men since the late 1990s and women since the late 1980s. What are the causes of the wage gap s fluctuation? Events during the 1960s including a narrowing in the educational attainment gap between blacks and whites Carlson and Swartz 1988 Cunningham and Zaloker 1992 Zalokar 1990 the economic boom and enforcement of antidiscrimination and affirmative action policy Betsey 1994 Fosu 1992 Heckman and Payner 1989 Leonard 1990 have been cited as evidence for the gap s narrowing. The contributors to the gap s expansion in the 1970s and 1980s are numerous erosion in antidiscrimination policy Leonard 1990 growing general wage inequality Blau and Beller 1992 deterioration in the manufacturing sector and a decline in union representation Bound and Freeman 1992. The economic boom from 1995 to 2001 is cited as a key contributor to the gap s narrowing during the 1990s Freeman and Rodgers 2000. For the latter period some assert that higher black incarceration rates disproportionally pulled the less skilled out of the labor force thus truncating the wage distribution at the low end and raising the average wage Neal and Rick 2014. Although much has happened in the macroeconomy e.g. a mild recession sluggish economic growth two jobless recoveries and the Great Recession since the 1990s boom little work has been done to describe and explain the gap s pattern or trends since 2000. Trends in educational attainment yield mixed messages as to the impact on the wage gap. Since 2000 college completion rates by black and white men have increased by 4.3 and 5.5 percentage points respectively. For black and white women the increases were 7.3 and 10.6 percentage points.4 Thus educational attainment will not contribute to any narrowing of either wage gap among collegeeducated blacks and whites. In fact for educated women patterns in the acquisition of a bachelor s degree or more will contribute to an expansion in the collegeeducated racial gap. However the trends in high school completion suggest that educational attainment will contribute to a slight narrowing in the overall wage gap and a narrowing in the wage gap among high school graduate blacks and whites. The percentage of white men with at least a high school diploma has increased by 4.5 percentage points since 2000 compared with 7.7 percentage points for black men. White women s percentage has risen by 5.1 points while the percentage for black women has risen by 9.3 percentage points.5 Patterns in imprisonment might put pressure on the wage gaps among the young and less educated to narrow or at best remain the same. According to the U.S. Department of Justice although the ratio of the imprisonment rate of white men and black men sat at 5.9 in 2014 it fell from 7.7 in 2000. The ratios among white women and black women fell from 6.0 in 2000 to 2.1 in 2014. For both much of the drop was from 2000 to 2007 because the white imprisonment rate rose while the African American imprisonment rate fell. Because the ratio remains so large imprisonment and its labor market scarring effects will definitely contribute to wage gaps in a given year but their pattern over time since 2000 should assist in narrowing the wage gap. Changes in the macroeconomy will surely have an impact on the wage gaps since 2000. The U.S. economy experienced a mild eightmonth recession from March to November 2001 but the jobless recovery that emerged in its aftermath was probably a more serious blow to the economy. Economic growth returned but it was not sustainable. From 2001 to 2007 the jobless rate was slow to fall wages continued to stagnate and household debt expanded to record levels. After the Great Recession of 2007 2009 job growth instead of rebounding quickly as it did after the 1980s recession took over 40 months to reemerge. Since February 2010 the economy has grown and privatesector job creation has spanned over 78 months. As of July 2016 the unemployment rate had fallen to 4.9 percent. However it wasn t until the end of 2015 that the jobless rate which includes underemployment workers who are marginally attached and working part time for economic reasons fell back below 10 percent. Further the labor force participation rate of primeage adults has not returned to prerecession levels. Unionization has historically provided a wage advantage to black workers since union members receive higher wages than otherwise similar nonunion workers and union membership rates are highest among black workers. Bound and Freeman 1992 documented the effect of declining unionization on wage losses among black men during the 1980s. Since then the share of workers with union representation has continued to decline falling 11 percentage points among blacks and 8 percentage points among whites between 1989 and 2015.6 We expect that this ongoing downward trend in overall union density and the convergence of membership rates among black and white workers has contributed to either flat or worsening racial wage gaps in the years since 2000. Historically the relationship between macroeconomic growth and blackwhite inequality has been such that as the economy expands blackwhite inequality typically narrows and when the economy worsens inequality expands. However given the generally slower economic growth that has been the norm since 2000 what have been the patterns of blackwhite earnings inequality during the recovery of 2001 2007 the Great Recession of 2007 2009 and now the current recovery? We suspect that after tremendous gains during the 1990s since 2000 racial inequality has followed general patterns of inequality either stagnated or expanded but not in a dramatic style as during the 1980s. Collectively tepid and unsustainable economic growth plus the Great Recession have led to expansion in the blackwhite wage gap. To operationalize our analysis of blackwhite wage gaps we use samples of white and black workers from the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group CPSORG files for the years 1979 through 2015. We estimate log hourly wage gaps between black and white workers adjusted for years of potential experience education region of residence and metro status.7 The log hourly wage gap measures the percent disadvantage of black workers wages relative to whites such that a smaller estimate indicates a smaller wage gap and more equity. The specification for the variables used to estimate adjusted wage gaps comes from Bound and Freeman 1992. Years of potential experience are measured as age minus years of schooling minus six.8 We use a linear specification for education until seven completed years and then use dummy variables for each level of attainment thereafter. Dummy variables for each of the nine Census divisions and the metropolitan statistical area indicator are used to control for region of residence and metro status.9 Much of the work on racial inequality has focused on the newentrant wage gap because this demographic is most sensitive to macroeconomic and structural change. We divide the sample of workers into two experience categories new entrants and more experienced workers and perform a separate analysis for each group. We examine the more experienced workers because they were new entrants during the 1980s when the wage gap began expanding. Doing this allows us to see whether early labor market disadvantages persist over time.10 New entrants are defined as workers with 0 to 10 years of potential experience. For high school graduates these are workers between the ages of 18 and 20 for those with a bachelor s degree or higher they are workers between the ages of 20 and 35. Experienced workers are those with 11 to 20 years of potential experience. High school graduates in this experience category are between the ages of 29 and 38. Experienced workers with a bachelor s degree or higher are between the ages of 33 and 45. Figure B plots the trend in log hourly wage gaps the percentage disadvantage between black and white workers by gender since 1979. The graph includes four series an adjusted and unadjusted series each for men and women. The unadjusted wage gaps are simply the average differences reported in the survey while the adjusted series present wage gaps among fulltime workers after controlling for racial differences in education potential experience region of residence and metro status. Note The adjusted wage gaps are for fulltime workers and control for racial difference in education potential experience region of residence and metro status. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Looking first at the unadjusted series we see the familiar pattern of expansion of blackwhite wage gaps during the 1980s. For men this expansion occurred primarily in the first half of that decade when unemployment was high and union density and the number of manufacturing jobs especially in the Midwest were drastically declining. As shown from the unadjusted men s series in Figure B black men s average hourly wages were 22 percent lower than those of white men in 1979 and by 1985 the gap had grown to 27 percent. Men s blackwhite wage gaps remained fairly stable from 1985 through much of the 2000s gradually trending upward to 31 percent by 2015. For women the expansion in the unadjusted blackwhite wage gap that began in the 1980s continued through the mid1990s. This is notable because with an average hourly wage gap of 6 percent black women were near parity with white women in 1979. By 1985 this gap had grown to 8 percent then nearly doubled to 15 percent by 1996. Since the mid1990s expansion of the women s blackwhite wage gap has been more gradual rising to 19 percent by 2015. While the adjusted and unadjusted series follow similar patterns the adjusted estimates provide additional information that helps us to better understand these wage gaps. For example part of the reason for the difference in average pay between white and black workers is that the composition of workers in each group is not the same. The difference between the adjusted and unadjusted series in Figure B shows how much of the average racial differences in pay among fulltime workers only can be explained by racial differences in education potential experience region of the country and metro status. For men these differences reduce the estimated gap by roughly the same amount 5 to 8 percentage points throughout most of the period we observe. For women however these characteristics go from having a very negligible effect on the gap in 1979 1.5 percentage points difference to reducing it by 7.3 percentage points by 2015. In other words the wage gap s growth was less pronounced between black and white women who have the same education years of experience metro status fulltime status and region of residence. These results suggest that while the impact of workforce composition on average blackwhite wage gaps among men has been fairly constant over time the impact among women has increased as the characteristics of black and white working women have grown more distinct. An important thing to note here is that these adjusted series do not account for workforce composition factors such as racial and gender differences in incarceration. The adjusted estimates also help us to more clearly identify periods of wage convergence that are less obvious from observing trends in the average unadjusted gaps. The adjusted series for men and women in Figure B both show a brief period of progress toward racial pay equity between 1996 and 2000. During this period the adjusted blackwhite wage gap falls from 23 percent to 20 percent among men and from 10 percent to 7 percent among women. During the late 1990s macroeconomic growth was sustained and broadbased and public policy became more favorable for reducing racial wage inequality. For example the Bureau of Labor Statistics unemployment rate fell and remained below 5.0 percent from July 1997 to September 2001 and the federal minimum wage was increased in 1997 and 1998. Also the number of states that set their minimum wage in excess of the federal minimum wage increased. The convergence of the wage gap during this period ended with the start of the short and shallow recession of 2001. Figure B also shows that racial differences in pay are smaller among women than among men regardless of whether the estimates are adjusted or unadjusted. However we have to be careful in how we interpret this finding. It does not mean black women face fewer challenges in the labor market than black men. It just means that potentially more of the disadvantage is associated with gender differences in pay e.g. relative to white men.11 Figure C shows adjusted hourly wage gaps for white and black women and black men relative to white men. Since black women were near parity with white women in 1979 their wage gap relative to white men was comparable. In 1979 for instance white women were at a 37.8 percent disadvantage relative to white men compared with a 42.3 percent disadvantage for black women relative to white men. Black women earned 25.4 percent less than black men in 1979 as measured by the difference between the lines for black women and black men 42.3 percent minus 16.9 percent. The gender wage gap narrowed considerably during the 1980s and early 1990s resulting by 1993 in a gap of 23.1 percent 14.7 percentage points lower for white women relative to white men a gap of 30.9 percent 11.4 percentage points lower for black women relative to white men and a gap of 10.6 percent 14.8 percentage points lower for black women relative to black men. These adjusted gender wage gaps have remained virtually unchanged since the 1990s so the economic boom did not narrow gender wage disparities in the same way that it narrowed racial wage gaps. Davis and Gould 2015 estimate that 40 percent of the narrowing of the gender wage gap between 1979 and 2014 was due to falling wages for men. Note The adjusted wage gaps are for fulltime workers and control for racial differences in education potential experience region of residence and metro status. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Just as there are clear differences in the racial wage gaps by gender young men and women face different wage gaps than older men and women. Figures D and E present estimates of adjusted men s and women s blackwhite wage gaps among new entrants 0 to 10 years of experience and more experienced workers 11 to 20 years of experience.12 Figure D shows that the male blackwhite wage gap expands across both experience categories but the gaps in each year are always smaller among new entrants representing blacks and whites with the least potential experience. This pattern suggests that wage gaps grow larger as black men pursue their work lives. The newentrant wage gap starts at 11.2 percent in 1979 and rises to an 18.7 percent disadvantage in 2015. On the other hand more experienced black men start with a larger disadvantage of 19.5 percent and end in 2015 with a 23.5 percent disadvantage. The graph also shows that the early 1980s expansion of men s blackwhite wage gaps occurred largely among new entrants a finding that is consistent with the idea that younger lessexperienced workers are most sensitive to macroeconomic and structural change. While the 1990s boom helped to reverse the relative wage deterioration of black men that occurred in the 1980s those gaps have since reemerged. Note Experienced workers have 11 to 20 years of experience. New entrants have 0 to 10 years of experience. Gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Comparable trends among women are shown in Figure E. Women s blackwhite wage gaps increased so sharply among more experienced women during the 1980s and early 1990s that they went from having smaller wage gaps than new entrants to having larger gaps. Newentrant women start with a blackwhite wage gap of 3.7 percent in 1979 and end at 10.8 percent in 2015. On the other hand more experienced black women start at a 1.5 percent disadvantage and rise to a 12.6 percent disadvantage in 2015. Similar to newentrant men the progress among newentrant women between 1996 and 2000 reversed much of the damage of the 1980s but since 2000 those gains have been erased. Note Experienced workers have 11 to 20 years of experience. New entrants have 0 to 10 years of experience. Gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Next we examine adjusted blackwhite wage gaps by educational attainment within each of the experienceage groups for men and women. This sorting allows us to see whether the deterioration in the wages of black men and women was uniform across educational attainment and experience levels or was concentrated among particular groups. We plot these estimates as threeyear moving averages in order to smooth out some of the volatility that results from cutting the data into smaller subsamples. While this process produces graphs that start at 1980 and end in 2014 indicating the middle year of the threeyear moving average the trends revealed would essentially be the same if our graphs began at 1979 and ended in 2015 allowing us to fold the educational analysis in our broader discussion of the trend over the last three and a half decades. Figures F and G plot the estimates for newentrant and experienced men respectively. The summary point from Figure F is that in 1980 the men s newentrant wage gap was largest among those with only a high school diploma but that group s wage gap did not grow much further over the next 36 years. On the other hand the wage gap among newentrant men with a bachelor s degree was smaller than that of high school graduates in 1980 but by the end of the period there was as much of a wage gap among the most educated as among any other group. The greatest growth seemed to be among those with more than a bachelor s degree as seen by the greater growth in the bachelor s degree or more category than in the bachelor s degreeonly category. W. Rodgers 2006 documented this growth of the racial wage gap among the most educated workers but few researchers and policymakers have paid attention to this finding that black male college graduates started the 1980s with less than a 10 percent disadvantage relative to white male college graduates and end with almost a 20 percent deficit in 2015. Note Wage gaps reflect a threeyear moving average. Gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Among more experienced black and white men sizeable gaps existed at all levels of education in 1980 as shown in Figure G. While gaps among high school graduates changed little over the next three and a half decades estimates among older collegeeducated men are more volatile making it difficult to draw any clear conclusions. Note Wage gaps reflect a threeyear moving average. Gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata The progression of women s blackwhite wage gaps by experience and educational attainment are distinct from those of men in some ways and similar in others. As shown in Figure H all newentrant women with a high school diploma or more start the 1980s with similar wage gaps between 3 and 5 percent while newentrant men s wage gaps vary more by attainment level. Among more experienced black and white women Figure I wage gaps were nearly nonexistent in 1980 or in the case of college graduates actually favored black women also in sharp contrast to the large disparities among more experienced collegeeducated black men. As with men the largest increase in the racial wage gaps for both new entrants and more experienced workers occurs among collegeeducated women especially among those with more than a bachelor s degree.

Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata This initial look at the general trends and patterns in racial wage gaps raises some key points that help to guide the remainder of our analysis. While blackwhite wage gaps for men and women are notably larger in 2015 than they were in 1979 this increase has not been consistent across time periods. Rather there are three distinct periods of change the 1980s the 1990s and post2000. Most of the expansion of racial wage gaps occurred during the 1980s for men and during the 1980s through the mid1990s for women. During the late 1990s racial wage gaps narrowed. While this reversal helped to make up for much of the expansion of newentrant gaps that occurred during the 1980s and early 1990s it was less successful at reversing the trend among more experienced workers and college graduates. This is surprising given the relative strength of the 1990s boom which suggests that for more experienced workers forces during the 1980s were more powerful than during the best economy since World War II. Over the last decade and a half average blackwhite wage gaps among men and women have widened only slightly even in the years surrounding the Great Recession. The exception to this pattern has been among newentrant women for whom racial wage gaps have grown more between 2007 and 2015 than in any other period included in our analysis. However the absence of major changes in men s blackwhite wage gaps during the seven years leading up to or following 2007 suggests that since 2000 forces other than the Great Recession have disadvantaged African American men. Our trend analysis will precisely inform us as to the relative sizes of the erosion improvement and erosion again of black wages relative to those of whites over the distinct periods of change we have identified. Comparison of unadjusted and adjusted estimates reveals that racial differences in education experience region of residence and metro status help to explain some of the average differences in pay between blacks and whites. For men these differences have accounted for a fairly consistent amount of the gap but for women these differences are responsible for more of the gap today than in 1979. Over the 36year period we examine changes in adjusted blackwhite wage gaps also vary by potential experience and by education. Next we analyze the dynamics behind these changes and assign broad reasons for the overall patterns of change by gender and potential experience as well as identify the interaction of potential experience with educational attainment and region of residence. This disaggregation is extremely important because it will further demonstrate the fact that there is no monolithic black experience. Economists have developed a useful tool for illustrating and describing the dynamics of how the blackwhite wage gap changes over time. Through a technique called wage decomposition we can identify whether changes in the blackwhite wage gap are due to changes in quantities of various attributes of blacks and whites or the prices or economic returns to their attributes.13 These attributes may be things we can easily observe and measure in the data like education and experience or things we cannot directly observe or measure in the data. Such unmeasured characteristics can include racial wage discrimination racial differences in unobserved or unmeasured skills or racial differences in labor force attachment of lessskilled men due to incarceration. Juhn Murphy and Pierce 1991 offer a wage decomposition technique that allows us to decompose observable as well as unobservable attributes. The decomposition of unobservable attributes is based on the white residual wage distribution the part of the white wage distribution that cannot be explained by observable factors but it can be interpreted in a way that is analogous to the decomposition of observed attributes. Under this framework quantities of unobserved attributes are represented as the percentile ranking of blacks in the white residual wage distribution. Prices of unobserved attributes are represented by white wage inequality as indicated by the variance of the white residual wage distribution. We use this wage decomposition technique to answer four questions To remain consistent with prior studies by Juhn Murphy and Pierce 1991 and W. Rodgers 2006 the decompositions are performed for people who are at least 18 years old employed in fulltime jobs and have 20 years of experience or less.14 Juhn Murphy and Pierce 1991 estimate these decompositions for black and white workers using the March CPS for 1979 to 1987 while W. Rodgers 2006 uses CPSORG files for 1979 to 1994. We use the CPSORG files from 1979 to 2015. We first discuss changes in the wage gap in terms of changes in observable versus unobservable attributes. In other words how much of the increase in the blackwhite wage gap can be explained by factors such as changes in education levels of black workers and how much of the increase is due to things that are difficult to measure such as racial discrimination or the lack of particular skills. Figure J presents the topline results of our decomposition by experience category and gender for the entire 36year period from 1979 to 2015. The full length of each bar represents the total percent change in the blackwhite wage gap. Each bar is also divided into two parts the part due to changes in racial differences in observable attributes includes quantities and prices of education experience region of the country and metro status and the part due to changes in racial differences in unobservable attributes includes racial discrimination andor unobservable skills and wage inequality. Positive numbers indicate expansion of the gap while negative numbers indicate a narrowing gap. Note that decomposition analysis is best done when changes in the wage gap and all components of the wage equation are measured relative to the average for the entire 36year series and not relative to an individual year in the series because the decomposition s estimates and thus conclusions can be sensitive to the specific year chosen. Therefore the estimated changes in the wage gap between two points in time will not be the same as those estimated by comparing two points along the line graphs illustrating wage gap trends. A detailed description of the methodology used in our analysis is included in the appendix. Note Experienced workers have 11 to 20 years of experience. New entrants have 0 to 10 years of experience. Change in gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Labels on top of bars indicate net change in the blackwhite wage gap. Total unobservables include factors such as racial discrimination unobservable skills and wage inequality. Total observables include education experience region of residence and metro status. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Figure J shows that the largest expansion of the wage gap since 1979 has occurred among African American women. This is especially troubling because black women also experience lower earnings associated with gender. The blackwhite wage gap for newentrant women has grown 10.0 percent over the last 36 years compared with 3.2 percent among newentrant men. Over this same period the wage gap among more experienced women has grown 10.8 percent while the gap among more experienced men expanded 4.1 percent. Figure J also shows that for both groups of men and for more experienced women most of the expansion of wage gaps over that 36year period has been due to unobservables worsening discrimination andor unobservable skills and growing overall wage inequality. For newentrant women growing racial gaps in observables education experience region and metro status account for most of the expansion. We provide a more detailed discussion of how each of these components has affected wage gap trends in a later section but first we describe these topline decomposition patterns by educational attainment and over distinct periods of time. In Figures K and L these decomposition results are further disaggregated by selected levels of educational attainment high school graduates bachelor s degree only and bachelor s degree or more. These graphs show that some of the largest erosions of wages relative to whites are among blacks with the highest levels of educational attainment. For example newentrant and experienced African American male bachelor s degree holders had losses of 4.9 and 5.1 percent between 1979 and 2015 Figure K. Experienced black women with only a bachelor s degree also lost ground as racial wage gaps grew by 5.6 percent among these older collegeonly women over the last 36 years Figure L. Even worse when we include African American men and women with advanced degrees i.e. when we look at the category of workers who have a bachelor s degree or more education relative earnings fall by more. Newentrant collegeeducated African American women are the exception to this pattern. Racial wage gaps among young women with only a bachelor s degree shrank by 1.8 percent while wage gaps among young women with a bachelor s degree or more education rose by less than 1 percent 0.8 percent changes that were not statistically different from zero.

Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Compared with college graduates high school graduates generally experienced slower growth experienced men or narrowing in their gaps newentrant men and women. The exception was experienced black women with only a high school diploma whose wages deteriorated 8.9 percent relative to their white female counterparts more than the 8.3 percent deterioration among the most educated women in this experience category. Similar to what we observed among all workers expansion of the wage gaps at each level of education was almost entirely due to unobservables worsening discrimination andor unobservable skills and perhaps also growing overall wage inequality. It may be tempting to view the improvement in relative wages among lesseducated younger workers as positive but it is well documented that mass incarceration may have pulled the leastskilled workers from the labor force and led to postincarceration scars which means that African American men and women disproportionately have exoffender status that precludes them from certain jobs andor makes it harder for them to convince an employer to hire them. If they do get employed they are paid at lower rates. This disproportionate exit from the labor force and larger wage penalties improves the relative skill composition of lesseducated blacks in the labor force Holzer 2004 Neal and Rick 2014. This sample selection truncates the black wage distribution from below thus raising the average wage of African Americans. If this occurred it would explain why the newentrant high school wage gaps did not expand. Solely focusing on the trend covering the period from 1979 to 2015 neglects describing or glosses over three distinct periods of change the 1980s the 1990s and the period since 2000. Figures MP show the topline decomposition results for each of the four genderpotential experience groups over distinct periods 1979 1985 1985 1996 1996 2000 2000 2007 and 2007 2015 that track trends in the expansion and contraction of wage gaps. We use 2007 as the dividing line for the post2000 years because it is the peak of the last business cycle separating the years leading up to and following the Great Recession.15 Note The signifies total net change labels where the change is statistically insignificant.

Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Comparing Figures M through P we see that regardless of demographic characteristics e.g. gender and potential experience blackwhite wage gaps expanded during the 1980s and early 1990s and narrowed from 1996 to 2000 although gaps among women expanded much more than gaps among men between 1985 and 1996. This suggests an important conclusion that rising unemployment like we saw during the early 1980s increases the blackwhite wage gap while falling unemployment like we saw during the late 1990s shrinks it. While economic growth and unemployment improved during the second half of the 1980s the effect on blackwhite wage gaps was limited by the fact that policies like failure to raise the minimum wage and lax enforcement of antidiscrimination laws were less conducive to closing these gaps. In each period newentrant blacks faced the greatest fluctuations or swings in their relative earnings. This is to be expected as they have the least skills and experience that typically insulate an individual from changes in the macroeconomy. Unobservable factors contributed to more of the change among new entrants in both of these periods while observable factors explain more of the growing gaps among experienced workers. Between 2000 and 2007 blackwhite wage gaps quietly trended upward but after 2007 the patterns are much less discernable such that a consistent explanation emerges. Again worsening discrimination andor unobservable skills and overall wage inequality have been the main causes of growing wage gaps since 2000. We now describe our decomposition results in greater detail. Table 2 presents these results for new entrants by gender and educational attainment for each of the subperiods as well as the entire 36year period from 1979 to 2015. The first row in Table 2 presents the total percent change in the wage gap over each period of time. The rows labeled total observable and total unobservable sum to the total percent change in the wage gap. Under each of these rows the respective quantity and price contributions sum to the total observable and total unobservable components. The observable attributes are further disaggregated into contributions from each characteristic that sum to their respective quantity and price totals.

Change in gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata From 1979 to 1985 newentrant African American men and women saw their relative earnings fall by 5.8 percent and 5.3 percent respectively. For young black men those six years were the period of the most rapid relative wage deterioration. Similar to the results for the full 36year period the loss in relative earnings was largest among black college graduates. The losses for black male and black female high school graduates were 5.0 and 3.2 percent respectively compared with losses of 7.7 and 6.6 percent for bachelor s degree holders and 12.5 and 6.6 percent for new entrants with bachelor s degrees or more education. The main source of the expansion among newentrant men and women during the 1979 1985 period was a worsening in discrimination andor unobservable skills of blacks. For example some cite the erosion in affirmative action and antidiscrimination laws during this period that lessened pressure on employers to maintain fair workplaces. This downward movement of blacks in the white wage distribution accounted for nearly twothirds of the gap s expansion among newentrant men 3.7 points of the total 5.8 percent and threefourths of the expansion among newentrant women 3.9 points of the total 5.3 percent.16 Among black college graduates growing discrimination was essentially the sole cause of the gap s expansion far outweighing the advantages black college graduates gained as a result of being slightly older i.e. more experienced than their white counterparts. Another factor driving the expansion of racial wage gaps during this period was the decline in relatively goodpaying jobs for workers with less than a college degree as measured by the contribution of education prices among all new entrants. Declining pay among workers without a college degree accounted for half of the gap s expansion among newentrant men during this period 2.9 points of the total 5.8 percent and onefifth of the decline 1.1 points of the total 5.3 percent among newentrant women. Among all newentrant men the effect of this change was so large that it completely overshadowed improvements in the racial wage gap resulting from young black men s progress toward narrowing the education gap 1.8 percent. Most young African American workers experienced a reversal of fortune in the 1990s. From 1996 to 2000 the relative earnings of newentrant black men and women narrowed by 3.8 and 4.9 percent respectively. All wage gaps among the various education subgroups that we analyze narrowed as well. The narrowing of the newentrant gaps during the second half of the 1990s tends to be due to a reduction in discrimination andor unobservable skills between blacks and whites the opposite of what occurred during the 1979 1985 period. This reduction accounted for 60 percent 2.3 points of the total 3.8 percent and 90 percent 4.4 points of the total 4.9 percent of the gap s narrowing among newentrant men and women respectively.17 Continued progress in narrowing the observed education gaps between young black and white men also contributed to the narrowing of the gap among newentrant men during this period. From 2000 to 2007 the gaps among newentrant men expanded by 2.3 percent while the gaps among newentrant women expanded by 1.4 percent. For both groups these increases are statistically insignificant but larger and more precisely measured increases emerged between 2007 and 2015. Since the Great Recession s start in 2007 gaps among newentrant women have expanded more than for any other group 7.6 percent while gaps among newentrant men have grown at almost half that rate 4.0 percent. The same factors that dominated prior to 2000 continue to generate the expansion and narrowing in the wage gaps. A worsening in the unobservable skills and attributes or an increase in labor market discrimination is the primary source of the erosion. From 2007 to 2015 the discrimination andor unobservable skills term accounts for onethird of the expansion 1.3 points of the total 4.0 percent among newentrant men and 45 percent 3.4 points of the total 7.6 percent of the expansion among newentrant women.18 Another major contributor to widening newentrant wage gaps since the Great Recession has been the growing educational differences arising from smaller increases in black college completion. It is also worth noting that inequality has impacted young black men s and women s wage deterioration more in the years since the Great Recession than during any other period. Growing earnings inequality disadvantages all lowerwage andor lessskilled workers but particularly African American workers because the black wage earner tends to be located in the lower tail of the white wage distribution. Interestingly the effect of growing earnings inequality has been greatest among African American newentrant college graduates and advanceddegree holders accounting for 65 percent 1.6 points of the total 2.4 percent of the expansion among men and 22 percent 1.5 points of the total 6.8 percent among women. Shifting to experienced workers Table 3 presents decomposition results by gender and educational attainment for each of the subperiods as well as the entire 36year period from 1979 to 2015. We find a pattern similar to new entrants but the size of the wage gap s expansion during the 1980s its narrowing during the 1990s and expansion since 2000 are smaller. Between 1979 and 1985 the average wage gaps of experienced workers expanded ranging from 2.3 percent for women to 2.6 percent for men half the size of the gap s growth among new entrants. Although losses were greatest for college graduates in this experience category as well their wage gaps expanded by less than those of collegeeducated new entrants. Growing wage inequality during the 1980s had a notably large impact on the relative wages of more experienced African American men accounting for 81 percent of the gap s expansion among all experienced men and as much as 96 percent among high school graduates. Similar to the results for new entrants the other major contributor to widening wage gaps among more experienced workers was the decline in relatively goodpaying jobs for workers with less than a college degree as measured by the contribution of education prices. This effect was 52 percent of the total increase among all experienced women 1.2 points out of the total 2.3 percent but among all experienced men it totally wiped out gains resulting from increased educational attainment and reduced discrimination andor unobservable skills. Note Total unobservables include factors such as racial discrimination unobservable skills and wage inequality. Total observables include education experience region of residence and metro status. Change in gaps are of adjusted average hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata During the 1990s some narrowing in the average wage gap occurs but it is less pronounced than in the expansion of the 1980s especially among women. Among all experienced women racial wage gaps closed by less than 1.0 percent between 1996 and 2000. The corresponding change among all experienced men was a 1.8 percent improvement and its primary source was reduced discrimination andor unobservable skills particularly for black men with a bachelor s degree or higher. Among experienced women the greatest improvements were among high school graduates 1.9 percent with reduced discrimination andor unobservable skills accounting for most of the narrowing here as well. Finally the period since 2000 is also suggestive of a worsening in African American progress for experienced men and women without a college degree. Experienced men with only a high school diploma saw their relative wages deteriorate more in the years leading up to the Great Recession 3 percent between 2000 and 2007 while for women in this category most of the deterioration has happened since the Great Recession 3.6 percent between 2007 and 2015. Since 2000 wage gaps among experienced college graduates are characterized by modest increases or stagnation. Discrimination andor unobservable skills play a larger role for men than women during this period. Next we examine whether less educated African Americans living in certain regions of the country or in metro areas were more adversely impacted by changes in the wage gap. Differences in regional economies and labor market institutions have a lot to do with variations in wage gap trends in different parts of the country. Our results reveal that the Midwest and the South represent opposite ends of the pole with respect to expansion of the blackwhite wage gap among high school graduates. In other words racial wage gaps have increased most in the Midwest and least in the South. The significance of this trend is further emphasized by the fact that in 1979 the Midwest had the smallest blackwhite wage gaps and the South had the largest. These two regions were home to over threefourths of African American workers in 2015 with 58.3 percent residing in the South. The South and Midwest also have distinct regional economies and labor market institutions. Therefore understanding how these dynamics have influenced racial wage gap trends in the Midwest and South is critical to understanding the national picture. Figures Q and R which show threeyear moving averages of blackwhite wage gap trends by region for men and women respectively illustrate that racial wage gaps were clearly larger in the South than other regions of the country throughout most of the 1980s but since then wage gaps in other regions of the country have risen to levels more consistent with the longterm pattern of the South. This convergence is largely due to the rapid expansion of blackwhite wage gaps in nonSouthern states throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Still there are notable differences in the experiences of black men and women in the South. Men s blackwhite wage gaps in the South remained relatively unchanged from the mid1980s to the mid1990s Figure Q while women s wage gaps expanded Figure R. Both men s and women s blackwhite wage gaps declined sharply during the late 1990s through about 2000. Since 2001 wage gaps in the South have risen to levels near to those seen before the late 1990s economic boom. Regional specific factors such as collective bargaining and manufacturing that once helped less educated African Americans no longer protect them. Note Data reflect threeyear moving average. Gaps are of adjusted hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Note Data reflect threeyear moving average. Gaps are of adjusted hourly wages. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Righttowork and minimumwage laws are both major wageinfluencing labor market policies that vary considerably across states and regions of the country. Righttowork laws prohibit a group of unionized workers from negotiating a contract that requires each employee who enjoys the benefits of the contract terms to pay his or her share of costs for negotiating and policing the contract. As a result this provision directly limits the financial viability and strength of unions. While we don t formally test for the contribution of righttowork laws we do explore the impact of declining unionization on blackwhite wage gaps in the next section of this report.19 Minimumwage laws which vary by state and region also have a disproportionate effect on black workers because they are overrepresented in lowwage jobs. We do not explicitly test the impact of these policies in this analysis but note some of the facts that may be influencing observed trends in the data. Prior to 2007 few Southern or Midwestern states set a minimum wage above the federal minimum and few states in any region of the country raised the state minimum wage independent of increases in the federal minimum wage. After a small increase in 1981 the federal minimum wage and most state minimum wages remained unchanged until the end of the decade. This likely contributes to the common trend of growing racial wage gaps across all regions during that period of time. The federal minimum wage was increased in 1991 and 1992 and then again in 1997 and 1998. Along with strong economic growth and an extended period of low unemployment these policy changes are consistent with the timing of narrowing of racial wage gaps in all regions during the late 1990s. Since 2000 there has been increased variation in minimumwage policy across states and localities as racial wage gaps across the country have continued to grow but at a slower pace than they did during the 1980s. Currently 29 states and the District of Columbia have a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage and 29 localities have adopted minimum wages above their state minimum wage EPI Minimum Wage Tracker 2016. Most of these changes have taken place in nonSouthern states. Next we turn to the effects of regional macroeconomic trends. Bound and Freeman 1992 found that lesseducated African Americans in the Midwest were hurt the most during the 1980s mostly because of the loss of manufacturing jobs which also coincided with declining unionization. We examine whether these losses have continued or if government assistance during the Great Recession and recovery have helped to reduce inequality in the Midwest. On the other hand the South was viewed as a rapidly growing economy during the 1990s with cities like Atlanta or the research triangle in RaleighDurham NC providing greater opportunity for African Americans. We explore this hypothesis and look at what has happened to racial wage gaps in the South during the 2000s. In order to test these theories about how wage gap trends are related to variations in regional economies we focus on high school graduates who as lessskilled workers are most susceptible to regional fluctuations in the economy. Tables 4 and 5 present decomposition results for newentrant and experienced high school graduates in the four major U.S. Census regions Northeast Midwest South and West. These findings are consistent with Bound s and Freeman s 1992 documentation of deteriorating earnings among young lesseducated black men during the 1980s as manufacturing jobs and unionization declined but they also show significant expansion of wage gaps since 2000. Table 4 shows that between 1979 and 1985 the blackwhite wage gap among male new entrants in the Midwest grew by 13.1 percent. As jobs opportunities dried up during this period discrimination was a major factor in the suppression of young black men s wages accounting for 63 percent of the racial wage gap s expansion 8.2 points out of the total 13.1 percent. The second largest period of expansion was 2000 2007 when the gaps grew 8.2 percent. There is also evidence that this disadvantage among men who were new entrants in the early 1980s carried over into later years of men s working lives. The experienced men s racial wage gap grew 19.2 percent between 1979 and 2015 Table 5 with most of the gap s expansion occurring between 1985 and 1996 as more of the early 1980s cohort of new entrants were aging into the more experienced category.

Total observables include education experience region of residence and metro status. Experienced workers have 11 to 20 years of experience. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Our findings also show that wage deterioration of black high school graduates in the Midwest was not limited to young black males but also included experienced black women. As shown in Table 5 between 1985 and 1996 racial wage gaps widened 12.8 percent among more experienced women in this region. The second largest period of growth has been during the years since the Great Recession gaps expanded 8.6 percent between 2007 and 2015. During both periods worsening discrimination andor increasing unobservable skills account for nearly all of the relative wage deterioration of experienced black women in the Midwest. Tables 4 and 5 also support the trends shown in Figures Q and R indicating big improvements in blackwhite earnings inequality among all groups in the South during the late 1990s economic boom. In fact Southern newentrant men s wage gaps declined during the late 1990s despite upward pressure on wage gaps exerted by overall wage inequality more so than in any other region of the country Table 4. Table 4 further indicates that the largest gains for Southern workers were among newentrant black women. Between 1996 and 2000 the newentrant wage gap among women with only a high school diploma closed 8.1 percent the largest gain of all the groups in any region of the country. While reduced discrimination andor improvements in unobservable skills were by far the largest factors in this improvement the decomposition results also suggest young black women were drawn to fastergrowing areas of the South. Division and metro quantities account for 15 percent of the improvement in relative wages of newentrant black women with only a high school education 1.2 points out of the total 8.1 percent. The Bureau of Labor Statistics began publishing metro area unemployment rates in 1990 and we use these local rates to further examine the impact of differences in local economic conditions on wage gaps. For the subset of metro areas for which unemployment rates are available we found that differences in metro area unemployment rates explain little of the changes in wage gaps since 1990.20 Adding this variable has a negligible effect on the decomposition results suggesting no improvement in the distribution of black workers across metro areas and no growing wagecurve advantage over time. In other words on average black workers haven t relocated to metro areas with lower unemployment rates nor have relative differences in unemployment rates across metro areas changed much since 1990. The erosion of collective bargaining is another factor that has caused wages to decline especially among middlewage workers and workers in the Midwest. On average the hourly wages of union members are 13.6 percent higher than those of otherwise similar workers Mishel 2012. For African Americans this union wage premium is even greater 17.3 percent. However as the share of workers represented by a union contract has declined fewer workers both union and nonunion have been able to reap the benefits of collective bargaining. As shown in Figure S although African American men and women remain more likely to be union members than their white counterparts rates of union membership have declined more sharply among blacks since 1983 the earliest year for which we have union membership data by race. At the same time union density or the percentage of people within a state who are represented by a union has also been declining. Source EPI analysis of Bureau of Labor Statistics Current Population Survey public data series Figure T shows how the decline in unionization has impacted blackwhite wage gaps since 1983. Between 1983 and 2015 the years for which data on union membership by race are available the blackwhite wage gap grew 1.6 percent among newentrant men and 3.0 percent among experienced men. The decline in unionization membership and state union density accounts for about onefifth of this growth regardless of experience. A diminishing union wage premium the percentagehigher wage earned by those covered by a collective bargaining contract accounts for 43 percent of the total growth in the men s racial wage gap among newentrant men and onethird of the gap s expansion among experienced men. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Racial wage gaps among women expanded by much more between 1983 and 2015 growing 7.6 percent among new entrants and 9.3 percent among experienced women. Declining unionization accounts for less than onetenth of the growth in the racial wage gap among women 1.3 percent for new entrants and 8.6 percent for experienced workers. A diminishing union wage premium accounts for 10.5 percent of the total growth in the women s racial wage gap among newentrant women and 17.2 percent of the gap s expansion among experienced women. The proportionately larger effect of deunionization on the wages of newentrant black men and more experienced black women is also consistent with large wage losses for these groups in the Midwest. African American union membership in the Midwest declined 64.3 percent between 1983 and 2015 compared with a decline of 53.8 percent among whites in the region. The results of our decompositions with the addition of union density and union membership variables are available in the appendix. Next we compare blackwhite wage gap trends in selected industries that are highly segregated by gender. For men we focus on the manufacturing and construction industries Table 6. The manufacturing industry accounted for 34 percent of men s employment in 1979 but only 17 percent by 2015. Men s employment in the construction industry has remained more stable at 9 percent over this time. For women we focus on the education and health industries Table 7. The share of women employed in these industries has increased from 30 percent in 1979 to 41 percent in 2015. Note Total unobservables include factors such as racial discrimination unobservable skills and wage inequality. Total observables include education experience region of residence and metro status. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata Note Total unobservables include factors such as racial discrimination unobservable skills and wage inequality. Total observables include education experience region of residence and metro status. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey CPS Outgoing Rotation Group microdata As shown in Table 6 since 1979 blackwhite wage gaps have narrowed among men in the construction industry with newentrant racial wage gaps improving 10 percent between 1979 and 2015. That improvement has been the combined result of the education levels of black and white men in the construction industry becoming more similar over time and the fact that these men are less segregated across regions and metro areas. Within the last eight years reduced discrimination andor increasing unobservable skills have also played more of a role in narrowing wage gaps. While the deterioration of relative earnings of newentrant black men within the manufacturing industry was similar to what was observed nationally between 1979 and 2015 there was a much larger decline in manufacturing during the 1980s. Between 1979 and 1985 newentrant racial wage gaps in the manufacturing industry grew 11.4 percent compared with 5.8 percent nationally. During this period returns to education account for almost 30 percent of the gap s expansion among newentrant men 3.3 points out of the total 11.4 percent suggesting that a significant part of the expansion was related to black men becoming more concentrated in lowerpaying jobs within the manufacturing industry. Among more experienced workers in the manufacturing industry these same factors account for 36 percent of relative wage deterioration 2.1 points out of the total 5.8 percent. Worsening discrimination andor increasing unobserved skills accounted for half of the growth in racial wage gaps among new entrants while growing overall wage inequality accounted for 41 percent of the growth among more experienced men 2.4 points out of the total 5.8 percent. On the other hand newentrant black men made considerable wage gains in the manufacturing industry between 1996 and 2000 benefiting from increased education and experience age. But over the entire period from 1979 to 2015 more experienced black men in the manufacturing industry lost ground in spite of narrowing education gaps. Growing overall wage inequality and increased representation in lowerpaying jobs in the industry outweighed the impact of increased education nearly 2to1. The wage gap expanded less for newentrant women in the education and health industries than in the broader workforce but for more experienced black women in these industries the magnitude of the expansion was similar to that in the overall workforce. Growing overall inequality and widening differences in the returns to education are the primary reasons for the expansion among newentrant women. For more experienced women widening differences in the returns to education and increased discrimination were the largest factors. Patterns of expansion and improvement over different periods of time mirror those observed in the larger samples. The above analysis shows how wage gaps changed within major industry sectors. Next we examine how much of the change in racial wage gaps can be explained by changing patterns of employment across sectors and occupations based on the percent of blacks employed in each industry and occupation each year. Industry and occupation classification codes changed several times over the course of our data series making it difficult to produce comparable estimates over the entire 1979 2015 period. As a way of working around this inconsistency in the data we proceed by using broad singledigit industry and occupation codes to produce one set of estimates for the years 1979 1999 based on older codes and another set of estimates for the years 2000 2015 based on the new codes. While the broad singledigit industry and occupation categories may be picking up less of the changing racial composition and wage structure of occupations than more detailed threedigit categories they still allow us to identify periods of time when the impact of these changes has been most significant.21 For example changing employment patterns had the largest effect on men s blackwhite wage gaps during the years 1979 1985. The employment of black men in more racially segregated jobs accounted for 28.6 percent a combined 1.6 points from industry and occupation quantities out of the total 5.6 percent of the growth in blackwhite wage gaps among new entrants and 41.2 percent among more experienced workers 1.2 points out of the total 2.5 percent. This finding is consistent with Blau and Beller 1992 who report that adverse occupational shifts increased the blackwhite wage gap for men during the 1980s. While the effects of changing patterns of employment on blackwhite wage gaps among women are minor in most periods changing occupational patterns have had the largest effect in more recent years. Between 2000 and 2015 the employment of black women in more racially segregated jobs accounts for 11.4 percent of the gap s expansion among new entrants 1.2 points out of the total 10.4 percent and 24.9 percent among more experienced workers 1.2 points out of the total 4.7 percent. Otherwise controlling for changing patterns of employment across industries and occupations offers little additional explanation for the growth and narrowing of racial wage gaps over time. Rather discrimination andor unobservable skills remain predominantly responsible for changes in racial wage gaps especially during periods of time when the gaps changed most. The results of our decompositions with the addition of industry and occupation variables are available in the appendix. This study revisits the trend and decomposition analyses that dominated the literature from the 1960s through the 1990s. We update and extend previous studies by examining what has happened to the blackwhite wage gap since the late 1990s. While blackwhite wage gaps are larger today than they were in 1979 we identify three distinct periods of change. The gaps expanded during the 1980s and narrowed significantly during the late 1990s both among men and women. Since 2001 wage gaps among men and women have widened only slightly even in the years surrounding the Great Recession. The exception to this pattern has been among newentrant women for whom racial wage gaps have grown more between 2007 and 2015 than in any other period included in our analysis. The magnitude of these changes varies by gender experience educational attainment and region of the country leading us to conclude that there is no single African American labor market narrative. This has been increasingly the case in the years since 2000. Though the African American experience is not monolithic our decomposition results reveal that the primary driver of the expansion and narrowing of these gaps has been changes in discrimination unobservable skills or some combination of the two. This term is likely capturing the ebb and flow of government enforcement in antidiscrimination and civil rights laws or the growing importance of other unmeasured factors. In the post2000 period these forces have been even greater than the effects of the Great Recession as the political and financial support necessary to fight labor market discrimination has continued to wane. Although for most groups wage gaps changed modestly in the years following the Great Recession discrimination was the primary factor driving those changes. The other factor consistently contributing to the expansion of these wage gaps has been growing earnings inequality in general. Regardless of one s race gender and labor market experience the wages of most workers especially lessskilled workers have stagnated over much of this period and this trend contributes to the widening of blackwhite wage gaps because the typical black worker is paid the wage of a low to moderateskilled white worker. While it was not directly addressed in this paper future analysis of wage gaps for lesseducated workers should incorporate the nonrandom selection associated with the rising trend in mass incarceration during the 1980s and 1990s. Patterns of imprisonment might suggest that the truncation in the wage scale associated with the departure of these potential workers may not have worsened since 2000. The ability to make these adjustments is currently limited by the scope of available data. Linking information on incarceration to individual records in the CPS and American Community Survey ACS files would be a major step toward generating estimates of the wage gap adjusted for past incarceration both in terms of labor force participation and the penalty on wages. The evidence we present here has major implications for addressing racial inequality. In many ways identifying wage gap trends and the factors contributing to them is the easy part. Actually taking the steps necessary to close and eliminate the gaps will require intentional and direct action. At a minimum there must be consistently strong enforcement of antidiscrimination laws in the hiring promotion and pay of women and minority workers. This includes greater transparency in the ways decisions in these areas are made and ensuring that the processes available for workers to pursue violations of their rights are effective. Next we discuss recommendations for supporting and strengthening these goals. The first recommendation involves the returns to education. Racial differences in college education continued to narrow after 2000 but our estimated gaps for college graduates indicate that just completing a bachelor s degree or more will not reduce the blackwhite wage gap. Black college graduates have higher wages than African American high school graduates but significant wage gaps between black and white college graduates have grown and persisted. It is wrong that as a society we send a message that you must get a college degree to obtain economic security yet even then you will experience a sizeable earnings disadvantage. This erosion in opportunity started in the 1980s but little has been done to address it. We speculate that part of the answer lies with challenges that all young college graduates face but these challenges are more acute for African Americans and the communities in which they live. Our first recommendation then is that the Obama administration and the next president hold summits on minority college graduates. The purpose would be to convene policymakers researchers practitioners current high school students current college students and recent graduates to identify and recommend ways to narrow the blackwhite wage gap among college graduates. Second we urge the Bureau of Labor Statistics to work with organizations directly engaged in the education workforce development and employment of African Americans to identify the unobservable measures that impact the blackwhite wage gap and devise ways to include them in the CPS or ACS so that we can obtain populationbased estimates of the wage gap adjusted for these additional measures. In practice this step would involve collecting some of the detailed information found in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth for the CPS andor the ACS. For example it would be useful to have more information about college graduate choices and experiences in the regular CPS and ACS or increase the wage sample in the October education supplement. It may also be time to consider funding a new NLS youth ages 14 to 22 cohort. Third we urge the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to work with experts to develop metropolitan area measures of discrimination that could be linked to individual records in the ACS or CPS. The goal is to allow researchers to directly assess the role that local area discrimination plays in the wage setting of African Americans and whites. The creation of a report card that describes a metropolitan area s racial climate could be useful for the public and its mere publication could change the behaviors of employers. The National Urban League might consider this assessment as a part of its annual State of Black America series. Firmspecific pay data by race ethnicity and gender are essential to such an undertaking but are not currently available. During the Clinton administration the Department of Labor implemented a pilot equal employment opportunity survey to provide regulators in the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs with wage and promotion data for employers by race ethnicity and gender. The objective of the survey was to enable the agency to better target its resources in addressing racial and gender wage discrimination. After commissioning several studies of the data collected through the pilot the office concluded that the survey failed to provide the utility anticipated and eliminated it. Although the data were not an effective tool for targeting enforcement at specific firms the information did reveal evidence of racial and gender pay inequities among workers in the same occupations and with the same work experience at the same firms Rawlston and Spriggs 2001. We recommend that the Department of Labor reinstate the survey or a similar instrument for the purpose of collecting detailed pay data at the firm level. Fourth since growing earnings inequality overall has consistently contributed to the expansion of racial wage gaps we have to address the broader problem of stagnant wages by raising the federal minimum wage creating new work scheduling standards and rigorously enforcing wage laws aimed at preventing wage theft. The Fight for 15 campaign has been instrumental in securing minimumwage increases in a number of states and municipalities and the Department of Labor s recent updating of the overtime income threshold will directly benefit 12.5 million workers. Both are major steps in this direction. We also need to strengthen the ability of workers to bargain with their employers a right that has been substantially weakened since the 1980s through for example laws passed by state legislatures that restrict public employees collective bargaining rights or the ability to collect fair share dues through payroll deductions. We need to push back against the proliferation of forced arbitration clauses that require workers as a condition of employment to give up their right to sue in public court. We need greater protections for freelancers and workers in gig employment relationships. To this end in New York the Freelancers Collective secured the introduction of legislation that would provide independent workers the same legal recourse as employees in traditional employment situations. And the recent agreement between Uber and the International Association of Machinists may begin to shift the nexus of power from gig companies to their employees. Finally we must engage macroeconomic policy to reduce these disparities. Wilson 2015 finds that on average the wages of black workers are more responsive than those of white workers to aggregate labor market changes. A doubling of the national unemployment rate is estimated to reduce real hourly wages by at least 8 percent for the median black worker compared with 3 percent for the median white worker. Carpenter and Rodgers 2004 and Rodgers 2008 show that the employmentpopulation ratio of minorities is more sensitive than that of whites to contractionary monetary policy. Thus the Federal Reserve should pursue monetary policy that targets full employment with wage growth that matches productivity gains. As former National Urban League President Hugh Price has said we as a society know what we need to do to address persistent racial wage and employment inequality. We just need the political courage.

His research interests include income inequality with a focus on labor and workforce development issues. Rodgers s expertise is frequently called upon by journalists for articles in The New York Times The Wall Street Journal and other publications and he is a frequent guest on numerous television and radio talk shows such as PBS s Nightly Business Report NBC s Meet the Press and National Public Radio s Market Place. He has a Ph.D from Harvard University. Economists have developed a useful tool for illustrating and describing the dynamics of how the blackwhite wage gap changes over time. Through a technique called wage decomposition we can identify whether changes in the blackwhite wage gap are due to changes in the attributes of blacks and whites or the economic returns to their attributes.22 Wage equations for blacks and whites i b w are estimated as follows lnWi i Xi i Zi i i  where lnWi denotes the natural logarithm of hourly earnings Xi denotes a matrix of observed attributes such as educational attainment Zi denotes a matrix of community attributes such as the region of the country or labor market conditions i and i denote the vector of regression coefficients that capture the economic returns of each attribute and i is the standardized residual meaning that it is distributed with a mean of zero and variance of one and i is the residual standard deviation of wages.  i Xi i Zi i i  The blackwhite wage gap can then be constructed by differencing the equations for whites and blacks. Doing so leads to the following expression lnWw lnWb w w b b w w b b w w bwhere the righthand side captures the predicted log wage gap due to differences in observable attributes such as educational attainment and experience and the predicted log wage difference associated with racial differences in local labor markets. The third term measures the residual gap which depends on the residual prices and the error terms. When evaluated at the means the residual gap depends on the amount of white residual wage inequality w and the mean black position in the white residual wage distribution b. To describe the trend over time we need to add a time dimension. Let t denote a period prior to the structural change in the economy and let correspond to the whiteblack difference within a year in the outcome and attribute that follows. The decompositions in year t and t are written as  lnWt t wt t wt wt t.  lnWt t wt t wt wt t . The rate of change in the racial wage gap before and after the structural change can be described as  lnWt lnWt t wt t wt t wt t wt wt t wt tt . Finally we choose year t and white prices as the reference wage structure by adding and subtracting the term t wt t wt wt t from the righthand side. This manipulation yields the following trend decomposition equation.  lnWt lnWt t t wt t t wt t wt wt t wt wt wt t t t To address the common index problem that plagues this type of decomposition we replace the t values with the series average of each component series length 36.23 Thus each component captures the change in a component s year t value relative to its average over the whole period. The first and second terms on the righthand side are measured quantities associated with educational attainment experience metro status and region. The terms represent changes across time in observed racialspecific attributes holding market returns fixed. The wage gap may narrow across time because the educational attainment and experience of blacks relative to whites narrows. The wage gap may also narrow because blacks are advantaged by working in fastergrowing regions such as the South. The third and fourth terms labeled measured prices capture changes in market returns holding observed characteristics fixed. For example an increase over time in returns to skills will cause the overall wage gap to expand if employers view blacks on average as having weaker communication or soft skills. The fifth term is labeled residual quantities. The term measures changes in unobserved racespecific characteristics which result in changes in the percentile ranking of blacks in the white residual wage distribution. Such unmeasured characteristics can include racial differences in labor force attachment due to incarceration differences in unobserved skills and wage discrimination by race. As an example reduced racial differences in these attributes could cause the ranking of the average black residual wage to rise from the 35th percentile to the 40th percentile of the white residual wage distribution all else equal. The final term considered the residual prices reflects changes in white residual wage inequality. One can think of the last term as changes in the wage penalty for having a position below the mean of the white residual wage distribution.

Metro status is used to distinguish people who live in a metropolitan statistical area MSA as identified by the Census Bureau from those who don t. This allows us to account for the fact that wages are typically higher in urban or metro areas than in rural areas. 8. Since 1992 educational attainment is measured in degree attained rather than years of schooling. To construct an estimate of years of schooling to use in the calculation of potential experience we compute the average years of schooling for a given degree attained and assign that value to respondents who report that degree. For years prior to 1992 we follow this same conversion pattern to make the two periods fully comparable. 9. In JuneAugust 1995 the format of the CPS household identifier was changed resulting in suppression of geographic identifiers for those three months and affecting roughly 17000 observations. In order to retain these observations we also include a dummy variable for missing metro status. 10. While the CPS does not allow us to follow the same individuals over time the cohort representative of new entrants beginning in 1979 would be the same age as the cohort representative of more experienced workers by 1990. 11. Based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics usual weekly earnings series for fulltime workers in 2014 African American women earned 11 percent less than African American men but 47 percent less than white men. 12. The wage gaps within experience categories should be interpreted with caution because of the wellknown biases associated with using potential experience versus actual experience and changes in the measurement of educational attainment beginning with the 1992 CPS see note 6 for an explanation. 13. The technique used in this paper attributed to Juhn Murphy and Pierce 1991 has its origins to Oaxaca 1973 and Blinder 1973. 14. Selfemployed individuals are excluded. 15. We also estimated decompositions using business cycle peak years and the late 1990s economic boom to delineate subperiods 1979 1989 1989 1995 1995 2000 2000 2007 and 2007 2014. Since some of these break points intersected trends in the expansion and narrowing of wage gaps we opted to present decompositions based on break points that were more consistent with clear periods of change. In addition to this variation we used 2009 coinciding with the end of the Great Recession as a post2000 break point. All of these estimates are available from the authors upon request. 16. Between 1979 and 1985 the median newentrant black male wage fell from the 35th percentile of the newentrant white residual wage distribution to the 32nd percentile. The median newentrant black female wage fell from the 41st percentile to the 40th. Estimates of white wage percentile positions of black workers available from the authors upon request. 17. Between 1996 and 2000 the median newentrant black male wage rose from the 32nd percentile of the white residual wage distribution to the 38th percentile and the median black female wage rose from the 39th to the 46th percentile. 18. After peaking at the 38th percentile of the white wage distribution in 2000 the median newentrant black male wage fell to the 35th percentile in 2015. The median new entrant black female wage fell from the 46th percentile in 2000 to the 40th percentile in 2015. 19. Gould and Shierholz 2011 find that wages in righttowork states are 3.2 percent lower than those in non righttowork states. Further the negative impact on black workers wages 4.8 percent is greater than that for white workers 3.0 percent. Given that the majority of the 25 righttowork states are in the South this finding is consistent with the existence of larger blackwhite wage gaps there than other regions of the country. While righttowork laws have long been typical of Southern labor market policy nearly all laws were passed in the 1940s and 1950s these laws have begun to creep more into states outside the South. Since 2000 five states Oklahoma 2001 Indiana 2012 Michigan 2013 Wisconsin 2015 and West Virginia 2016 have passed righttowork laws. This recent resurgence of righttowork laws could potentially be a contributing factor for future wage trends in nonSouthern states but doesn t explain the trend of rapidly growing wage gaps in nonSouthern states during the 1980s and 1990s. 20. For the metro areas with nonmissing values we perform our decomposition with and without controlling for the metro area unemployment rate and then compare the two sets of results. Estimates are available from the authors upon request. 21. Juhn Murphy and Pierce 1991 examine the effects of occupational distribution between 1963 and 1987 using both the threedigit and singledigit codes and conclude that the results were similar. Additionally declining racial segregation in the workplace slowed considerably after the 1980s Spriggs and Williams 1996 Rawlston and Spriggs 2002 Stainback and TomaskovicDevey 2012. Therefore although occupational segregation may explain a significant portion of racial wage disparities in a given year we expect the effect on changes in the wage gap over time to be minimal. 22.

While the discussion of racial inequality in the United States is often focused on economic inequality racial inequality also manifests itself in a multitude of ways that alone and together impact the wellbeing of all Americans. This includes racial disparities in wealth education employment housing mobility health rates of incarceration and more.1 In her January 2022 remarks at the 2022 Virtual Davos Agenda hosted by the World Economic Forum Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen stated A country s longterm growth potential depends on the size of its labor force the productivity of its workers the renewability of its resources and the stability of its political systems. This concept underpins the Biden Administration s economic growth strategy which Secretary Yellen has coined modern supply side economics. According to Secretary Yellen modern supply side economics prioritizes labor supply human capital R D and investments in a sustainable environment. These focus areas are all aimed at increasing economic growth and addressing longerterm structural problems particularly inequality. 2 This reflects a recognition that despite an aim to advance economic growth many policies in areas such as access to the labor market housing and infrastructure have not benefited all Americans. This has impacted the ability of communities of color rural communities and other historically marginalized people to fully participate in and benefit from the nation s prosperity. Our economy as a whole cannot be as productive as possible unless all individuals are given the opportunity to be as productive as possible. As a result the legacies of structural racism continue to hamper economic growth for everyone. Furthermore some economic policies that would directly benefit Americans of all races and ethnicities have been undermined by zerosum arguments that play to fears that one group will benefit at the expense of another.  There are of course moral legal microeconomic and other reasons to promote a more just and equitable society. In a series of blog posts over the coming months we will focus on the economic argument for reducing racial inequality. The economic cost of racial inequality is borne not just by the individuals directly faced with limited opportunities but also has spillovers to the entire U.S. economy. Especially as the country becomes more racially diverse see Figure 1 inequality poses an ongoing threat to our individual and collective economic welfare.  Figure 1 Changing Racial and Ethnic Composition of the U.S. Population Notes Hispanic refers to anyone of Hispanic ethnicity regardless of race. The remaining groups exclude anyone of Hispanic ethnicity. Prior to the 1980 decennial census individuals were not directly asked about whether they were of Hispanic origins. For data before the 1980 decennial census Hispanic is imputed by IPUMS. Source Treasury calculations using U.S. Census Bureau data from IPUMS. Steven Ruggles Sarah Flood Sophia Foster Ronald Goeken Jose Pacas Megan Schouweiler and Matthew Sobek. IPUMS USA Version 11.0 dataset. Minneapolis MN IPUMS 2021. httpsdoi.org10.18128D010.V11.0  Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo emphasized this argument in his September 2021 blog post The exclusion of communities of color from the ladder of economic opportunity holds back economic growth for the entire country. Pursuing racial equity is a vital opportunity to drive innovation and boost growth across the U.S. economy. 3 When people gain access to the resources they need to build their economic future and withstand financial shocks it is not just good for individuals and their families but it also benefits the communities where they live work and invest with beneficial spillovers to the economy as a whole. Likewise when investments are made that allow millions of people who have been held back economically to reach their full economic potential it gives the United States an important advantage in an increasingly competitive global economy. We cannot afford to leave talent and opportunity on the table. Below we briefly discuss the origins and persistence of inequality in the United States highlight some of the key economic indicators of its impact and give an overview of the issues we will explore in more depth in future posts. Racial inequality in the United States today is rooted in longstanding behaviors beliefs and public and private policies that resulted in the appropriation of the physical financial labor and other resources of nonwhite people. While a review of the origins of racial inequity is beyond the scope of this blog it is important to note the prominent role of inequitable and harmful policies dating back to before the country s founding. These include attacks on Native Americans political status and expropriation of their land the reliance on slavery to underpin a significant portion of the colonial and then U.S. economy and the Jim Crow laws and other formal and informal policies that enforced segregation and severely limited opportunities for nonwhite Americans. The millions of African Americans who left the southern United States to escape Jim Crow laws faced formal and informal employment housing and educational discrimination in destination cities in the North and West.4 Native Americans who survived the military conquests of the mid19th century were subject to policies that disenfranchised them forced their assimilation and relocation and removed Native children from their households. AntiLatino sentiment which grew in the 19th century as emigration from Mexico to the United States increased in the years following the MexicanAmerican War grew further following the Great Depression due to concerns that Mexican Americans were taking jobs from EuropeanAmericans.5 Similarly antiAsian sentiment grew following the arrival of Chinese immigrants during the California Gold Rush which was manifested in the Chinese Exclusion Act prohibiting the immigration of Chinese laborers beginning in 1882 and was ignited again after the bombing of Pearl Harbor with the establishment of Japanese internment camps by executive order which resulted in the forced relocation and internment of about 120000 Japanese Americans.6 While the most targeted racist laws and policies have been repealed or otherwise abandoned subsequent policies uneven enforcement of equal protections and a failure to invest in individuals harmed by de jure and de facto discrimination has resulted in vastly limited opportunities and stark inequities between white and nonwhite Americans that have continued to this day. For example maps drawn by the Home Owners Loan Corporation a now defunct federal agency to portray the relative riskiness of lending across neighborhoods in the 1930s were used by banks to deny access to credit to residents of the lowestrated neighborhoods who were often racial and ethnic minorities though these policies also hurt poor white individuals.7 Moreover this conduct depressed home ownership rates house values and rents and increased racial segregation in lowrated neighborhoods in subsequent decades highlighting the lasting negative economic consequences of racism on the community and on future residents of these neighborhoods regardless of race.8 These and other policies and actions not only led to continued racial disparities in access to resources and opportunities they also led to differences in the extent to which people of different races benefit from the resources and opportunities they already possess.9 These disparities are evident in the persistent overrepresentation of Black and Hispanic Americans among the population in poverty in the United States and in the widening of the racial wealth gap in recent decades.10 While the poverty rates for all racial and ethnic groups had been declining prior to the COVID19 pandemic see Figure 2 the gaps between the rates for Black and Hispanic Americans and nonHispanic white Americans has remained relatively constant since the early 2000s. At the same time the gap in average net wealth between Black and Hispanic households and nonHispanic white households has widened significantly see Figure 3. Figure 2. Poverty Rate by Race and Hispanic Origin 1959 to 2019 Figure 3. Household Net Worth by Race and Hispanic Origin 1989 to 2019 Source Federal Reserve Board httpswww.federalreserve.goveconresnotesfedsnoteswealthinequalityandtheracialwealthgap20211022.htm  Racial disparities in outcomes predictive of future success appear early in life. In 2010 math skills at kindergarten entry were over half a standard deviation higher for white students than for Black or Hispanic students with similar disparities in reading skills.11 These disparities in educational outcomes continue into higher education. In 2019 40 percent of white adults had earned a bachelor s degree compared to just 26 19 and 17 percent of Black Hispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native adults respectively.12 Large educational disparities coupled with racial discrimination in the labor market and other factors lead to pronounced differences in economic security across racial groups. In 2019 the unemployment rate was 6.1 percent for both Black and American Indian or Alaska Native adults compared to just 3.3 and 2.7 percent for white and Asian adults respectively. Similarly the rate for Hispanic adults was 4.3 percent and only 3.5 percent for nonHispanics.13 In addition Black and Hispanic adults continue to have considerably lower earnings than White or Asian adults. Median household income in 2020 was roughly 46000 and 55500 for Black and Hispanic workers respectively compared to 75000 and 95000 for white and Asian households as shown in Figure 4. These earnings differences have changed little since 1970 and are one of the primary contributors to the persistence of the racial wealth gap. In 2019 the median white family had 184000 in family wealth compared to just 23000 and 38000 for the median Black and Hispanic families respectively.14 Racial disparities in educational and economic outcomes not only impact the economic wellbeing of racial and ethnic minorities they have also been shown to inhibit economic growth for the U.S. economy as a whole which affects the economic security of every American regardless of race. For example recent research by economists ChangTai Hsieh Erik Hurst Charles I. Jones and Peter J. Klenow shows that up to 40 percent of growth in U.S. GDP per capita between 1960 and 2010 can be attributed to increases in the shares of women and Black men working in highly skilled occupations likely due to changes in social norms that previously hindered talented women and Black men from pursuing their comparative advantage.15 This research suggests that sexist and racist social norms prevented the U.S. economy from reaching its full potential and that working to ensure that every American has an equal opportunity to pursue the career he or she chooses should improve economic outcomes for all. Figure 4. Real Median Household Income by Race and Hispanic Origin 1967 to 2020 Racial gaps in wellbeing extend beyond educational attainment and economic security. Health disparities for example also begin early in life and persist over the lifespan. Black and Hispanic Americans face higher rates of child abuse16 lead exposure17 obesity in childhood18 and chronic illness in adulthood than white Americans.19 These groups often experience restricted access to quality health care an issue further illuminated by the recent global pandemic. Compared to white nonHispanic Americans Hispanic Black nonHispanic and American Indian or Alaska Native nonHispanic Americans are 1.8 1.7 and 2.1 times more likely to die from COVID19.20 Moreover as the COVID19 pandemic has shown the inequitable distribution of healthcare in the United States can negatively impact the health of all Americans including those with access to highquality services. In addition people of color in the United States are overrepresented in neighborhoods with high poverty rates. In 2019 nearly a quarter of American Indians or Alaska Natives 21 percent of nonHispanic Black people and 17 percent of Hispanic people lived in highpoverty neighborhoods defined as Census tracts with a poverty rate of 30 percent or higher. In contrast only 4 percent and 6 percent of white and Asian or Pacific Islander people lived in highpoverty neighborhoods.21 Highpoverty neighborhoods often lack vital resources and amenities like good schools large and affordable grocery stores reliable public transportation and safe and clean community spaces that enable residents to succeed in the classroom and on the job. It is important to note that while we have reliable measures and data sources to define the differences in many outcomes between racial and ethnic groups over the past forty years our ability to trace racial inequality back further and examine the country s progress since the end of slavery is limited by the quality and quantity of data available. For example greater disparities exist within the Asian American and Pacific Islander group than are often evident in aggregate data and data on Native communities in the United States is usually inadequate for any in depth analyses. Moreover for some outcomes such as wealth our ability to measure contemporary differences is also limited by data availability. Upcoming posts will discuss in greater depth the extent of racial inequality in economic security and explain how differences in in educational opportunity and attainment neighborhoods and environmental factors health and access to healthcare and employment and job quality contribute to and are caused by the persistence of racial disparities in economic wellbeing. Each post will highlight important facts discuss how key outcomes have evolved over time and emphasize the connections with other components of economic inequality with the goal of calling attention to areas where more work is needed to advance racial equity. In addition we will discuss issues related to data quality and coverage that affect our ability to truly understand the trajectory of racial inequality in the United States. 1 Shapiro Thomas M.

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/racial-wage-gap-starts-as-early-as-16-heres-why.html, The racial wage gap may be shrinking but it s still got a ways to go. Nationwide Black people make 76 cents to white people s dollar according to the Department of Labor. And it turns out that disparity starts pretty early on. In the fourth quarter of 2023 the median weekly earnings for fulltime wage and salaried white workers ages 16 to 24 was 747 per week according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The median weekly earnings for fulltime wage and salaried Black or African American 16to24yearolds was 614. Though a smaller gap than the national one that still works out to be about 82 cents to white workers dollar. Many people in this age group are only starting their careers and haven t had much time to accrue work experience. So what explains their disparity in pay? Here s what experts believe is playing into it. Especially as it pertains to young people job opportunities are often a direct result of their family situation.   Children born in higher income and higher wealth families will have greater access to opportunities that their parents can present says Andre Perry senior fellow at Brookings. A kid born to parents who work in law and advertising for example will have more access to internships or administrative positions in those higher paying fields than a kid born to parents who work in the postal service or the local transit system. Statistically Black people are overrepresented in lower paying fields. They make up 40.4 of postal service clerks according to the Pew Research Center where they make a median of 56200 per year according to BLS. They also make up 36.6 of bus drivers transit and intercity workers who make a median of 50980 per year. Conversely they make up just 10.5 of computer and mathematical science occupations according to the Economic Policy Institute where the median annual salary is 100440 and 6.9 of legal occupations where the median annual salary is 95170. The resulting family wealth can hinder access to higher paying jobs as well. A college or high school kid can be offered a lucrative gig in a neighboring town but if they don t have a way to get there it s harder to accept it. If your parents have a car you ll have more opportunities to get a premium job says Perry. And even if public transportation gets you to that job you may be limited in the number of hours of work because you can t use transportation at any time says Valerie Wilson director of the EPI s Program on Race Ethnicity and the Economy.  Whenever you re talking about outcomes of children what you re really describing is the outcomes of adults says Perry. Geographic location plays a role in how much young people ultimately get paid as well. It s important to consider the average wages in places where we know communities of color are concentrated says Laura ValleGutierrez a fellow at leftleaning think tank The Century Foundation.  More than half of the U.S. s Black population lives in the South according to the Pew Research Center a region with some of the lowest minimum wages in the country. The biggest Black populations live in states like Texas where the minimum wage is 7.25 per hour and Georgia where the minimum wage is 5.15 per hour for any employer that doesn t fall under the jurisdiction of the federal 7.25 per hour. There s also variation in the youth minimum wage. Nationwide under the Fair Labor Standards Act employers are allowed to pay people younger than 20 years old 4.25 per hour for the first 90 days of employment. Some states follow that rule while others like Minnesota have implemented a higher 8.85 youth minimum. Minnesota s regular minimum wage is 10.85 per hour. Finally college degrees play into this disparity. While 11 of white 18to24yearolds have a bachelor s degree according to the Census Bureau 7 of Black 18to24yearolds do. Some of the people in this age group are working jobs that don t require a post secondary credential says ValleGutierrez. So that is part of why they re having lower wages.  Big picture I think it s just important to keep in mind that these wage gaps that do start early really do result in a lifetime of consequences in terms of lifetime earnings says ValleGutierrez. Young people who start behind their peers have that much more ground to make up to reach similar wages if they re ever able to at all. Want to land your dream job in 2024?

As General Counsel private practitioner and Congressional counsel she has advised financial institutions businesses charities individuals and public officials and written and lectured extensively.  With much of its early history rooted in the free labor of enslaved Africans and Native Americans income inequality in the United States is substantially older than the country itself. Efforts to close these wage gaps are far more recent.  The Cambridge Dictionary defines a wage gap as the difference between the average pay of two different groups of people. Consistent income inequality can lead to a population group or groups amassing more wealth than others. Among the organizations that track these kinds of wage gaps are the Federal Reserve the Economic Policy Institute and the Urban Institute.  Some pay gaps can be explained by educational differences and geographic location factors. However even when you control for such factors wage disparities remain prevalent. Intentional systemwide laws and practices underlie these differences and have played a role in creating them.  For example several deregulatory legal edicts including the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 created a highrisk economic environment that eventually led to a sudden massive withdrawal of credit that ultimately resulted in the Financial Crisis of 2007 08 further exacerbating existing inequalities. Discriminatory recruitment practices have also played a prominent role in perpetuating wage gaps particularly with regard to highpaying professions. For instance African Americans are underrepresented in science technology engineering and math careers.  According to a 2018 study from the Pew Research Center 72 of Black STEM science technology engineering mathematics professionals cite discrimination in recruitment hiring and promotions as a major causative factor. Also causative and earlier in the process 77 of these professionals report being less likely to have access to quality education that prepares them for these careers another result of the nation s income inequality and the unequal educational system that propertytaxbased school funding produces.  The key law Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is about 60 years old. It banned compensation discrimination due to race color religion sex or national origin. Then in 2009 came the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act which amended prior changes to several federal laws protecting workers rights and clarified that all inequitable discriminatory payments are illegal regardless of how long those pay decisions or practices occurred.  Passing laws is an important step toward societal change but often these laws do not produce or complete that change. That s not to say there hasn t been any progress. But such progress has not reached all groups or been experienced equally. For instance Native American wage growth and employment continue to decline factors contributing to a high poverty rate one out of three and an annual median income of only 49906 annually. Additionally over the majority of the last 60 years African Americans have experienced recessionarylevel unemployment rates and widespread residential segregation.  Despite everything that has changed over the past 60 years substantial discriminatory earning gaps among various population sectors persist. The largest wage gap by far is by race.  There are notable wage gaps among American workers by race. Those of Asian ancestry have a higher weekly median income than White Black and LatinX individuals according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data for Q2 of 2023. In addition men generally earn more than women.  Black and LatinX workers have the lowest weekly median income with Black men and women making more than LatinX men and women respectively. This has obvious consequences According to our research Black and LatinX families were twice as likely to have no wealth or debt according to a 2021 study from the Federal Bank of St. Louis.  Note also that the higher earnings of some Asian Americans don t mean that all Asian Americans earn more. According to the Department of Treasury there is much greater wealth inequality among Asian Americans than among White Americans. Nonwealthy Asian Americans are poorer than their White counterparts and wealthy families are richer.  White workers make up the largest segment of the U.S. job market and Asian Americans the smallest.  So what happens to the wage gap if you control for education? Does it shrink or go away? The answer shows a complex picture. For instance median annual earnings for workers with a bachelor s degree or higher in 2016 followed a nearly identical pattern to the overall median weekly income chart above.  Asian workers earned the most followed by White Black and LatinX workers. In all cases where educational attainment was limited to an associate s degree or less White workers earned more than Asian ones. Similarly Black workers with an associate s degree or lower earned less than LatinX or Asian workers.  Education does make a difference The gaps are narrower than they are for workers overall when a constant amount of experience and identical job titles are accounted for though it once again follows the overall pattern. Between 2017 and 2019 Black men earned 98 cents for every dollar earned by men of other races with the same experience and education doing the same job in the same location according to 2020 research from SHRM the Society of Human Resources Management. This results in 99 cents for Latinos 1 for White men and 1.02 for Asian men.  Similar research shows a deeper earnings divide across job titles between men and women particularly for Black women. In 2016 the National Women s Law Center found that Black women in lowwage occupations earned approximately 21700 annually compared to 36000 annually for White men in the same positions. The study reported that in terms of higherpaying jobs such as lawyers engineers and physicians or surgeons Black women earned approximately 70000 annually compared to 110000 annually for White men in the same positions.  Looking deeper at the origins of the wage gap one encounters another socioeconomic divide that affects a person s earning potential The opportunity gap. This concept refers to the ways in which race ethnicity socioeconomic status English proficiency community wealth familial situations or other factors contribute to or perpetuate lower educational aspirations achievement and attainment for certain groups of students. It has obvious professional consequences clearly connected to income inequality.  One clear part of the opportunity gap is the unequal distribution of social capital based on peoples personal relationships and networks across different classes races and other groups. Upward economic mobility can be difficult without access to social networks that connect and interact with highearning individuals andor institutions. Simply put having friends family members or other social connections in high places makes it easier to secure job opportunities such as by having a contact willing to provide referrals to potential employers.  Further contributing to the opportunity gap are the ways people are recruited into particular fields and which groups benefit from them. For instance highpaying careers such as the majority of STEM professions typically require some form of postsecondary education. Research published in the International Journal of STEM Education notes that a lack of peers senior mentorship and culturally relevant educational programming has been shown to discourage minority students from completing their STEM programs.  Then as the Pew study showed there s the sheer racism in the job market encountered by those seeking employment. For instance a 2016 study by researchers at the University of Toronto and Stanford University reported that resumes were 30 to 50 less likely to lead to job callbacks from employers if they contained minority racial cues such as names typically associated with Black or Asian identities. The researchers went on to replicate those findings in a 1600resume study of their own.  Another aspect of the racial income gap is occupational segregation which occurs when a demographic group is overrepresented or underrepresented across and within certain occupations. For example Black men are more often employed in lowerpaying industries than White men who are far more likely to occupy highpaying senior positions. Of all the Fortune 500 CEOs in 2023 only 1.6 were Black.  And finally unemployment plays a major role in income disparity A December 2019 study comparing Black and White workers from the Center for American Progress reports that the employed share of Black workers between November 2018 and October 2019 was 75.7. The figure for White workers during the same period was 80.8. Across races women are paid less than men. Black men and women are paid less than their White peers who generally make less than Asians and LatinXs are typically paid less than Blacks. A wage gap is the difference in pay based on gender race or other discriminatory factors. There are several reasons wage gaps exist. According to the Department of Labor the gender wage gap exists because women are undervalued. Racial gaps exist due to socioeconomic reasons including race ethnicity status and many other factors.  Despite everincreasing efforts to promote equal opportunity and diversity within the U.S. labor market race and gender discrimination remain pervasive. If companies are truly committed to fostering real social change a good place to start is by eliminating any bias that prevents everyone from being paid a fair and equitable wage for their work.
