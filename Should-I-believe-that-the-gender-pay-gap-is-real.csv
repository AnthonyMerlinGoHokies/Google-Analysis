https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/w4kbny/cmv_the_gender_pay_gap_is_largely_caused_by/,  So basically my view is that women are more likely to want to have time off to be with the family which leads to less total pay. One of the biggest examples of this in the US is becoming a teacher. Teachers are one of the most low paid professions but it is disproportionately women because of the great work life balance that comes with only working during school hours.   Anecdotally my own mother is a doctor who gets paid less than her male counterparts. This is because when she joined her partnership she negotiated for a lower salary with more time off so that she could spend time with her children while they were growing up.   My last point is the difference in negotiation skills between men and women which leads to differences in pay for the exact same tasks. 57 of male Carnegie Mellon graduate business students negotiate their starting salaries. However only 7 of women negotiate salaries men s starting salaries are 7.6 higher than women s. source It seems that women are or at least used to be worse at negotiation and lost some potential salary this way as well.   The wage gap has actually narrowed for the younger generations source. IMO this is a reflection of changing goals in life among younger women and stronger negotiation skills as they focus on their career more than previous generations have.   So I hope this post doesn t offend anyone. I m completely open to new perspectives. It just doesn t seem to be a systemic problem like the news would have you believe and seems to have more to do with our own personal culture of motherhood. So please change my view.   Edit I ve got to go now. This has been a very educational thread and I hope I didn t offend anybody. I ve come to the conclusion that a part of the wage gap is probably due to differences in employersocietal expectations. It looks like around 56 in the studies that adjust for most other factors not nearly as large as politicians would have you think but still definitely not zero. Thanks for the new perspective. Hopefully one day everybody can get paid a fair wage for the work that they do. PS teachers are God sends!!! 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/elissasangster/2021/03/24/the-pay-gap-is-real-dont-let-anyone-convince-you-otherwise/, March 24 2021 is Equal Pay Day in the United States marking how far into 2021 a woman would have to work to make as much as a white man made in 2020. While paying people equitably seems uncontroversial wage gap data has been subject to misinterpretation by people who question whether the gap actually exists.  To have meaningful conversations about the gender wage gap and explore strategies for shrinking it it helps to make sure everyone is looking at the same data and that they understand what it represents. Below I ve shared some information that may be useful in responding to misleading claims about the gender wage gap. I ll use numbers from PayScale s 2020 Gender Pay Gap Report. PayScale is a company that tracks salary data on a large scale to provide realtime compensation information to individuals and businesses and this report analyzed data from nearly 1.6 million people. It found that women make only 0.81 for every dollar a man makes. I want to note that this report used prepandemic data and the pandemic has disproportionately affected women so it s likely that the current numbers are even worse.  Here are some suggestions for how to address the pay gap in conversation with skeptics The 0.81 number refers to the uncontrolled gender pay gap. It compares the earnings of women and men across industries. It s an overall number but it s an important one. According to the Center for American Progress an independent nonpartisan policy institute Calculating it this way allows experts to capture the multitude of factors driving the gender wage gap. In other words it enables us to see the big picture and recognize the overall challenges that women especially women of color continue to face in the workplace. According to PayScale s report the uncontrolled pay gap for women of color is 0.75 for every dollar a man makes. They are referring to the controlled gender pay gap which controls for differences in job titles work experience industry location and other factors. The controlled gender pay gap compares what men and women working in similar jobs are paid. When looking at the controlled gender pay gap PayScale found that Hispanic and white women make 0.98 and Black women make 0.97 for every dollar a white man with the same qualifications makes. These gaps may look small at first glance but they are significant. Wrong. AAUW s report The Simple Truth About the Gender Pay Gap shows that over the course of a 40year career that twocent gap adds up to 80000 in lost earnings which doesn t account for the lost interest if that income had been invested along the way. Because women have lower lifetime earnings they receive less in Social Security and pensions. Per AAUW In terms of overall retirement income women have only 70 of what men do. Women do outnumber men in higher education but as AAUW points out Women also hold nearly twothirds of the outstanding student debt in the United States. And because of the gender pay gap women have a harder time repaying loans. Women continue to be underrepresented in business schools and that s something I m working to change as CEO of Fort . Our research shows that MBA women see an average pay gain of 63 of their preMBA salary in their first postMBA role but that doesn t make up for the pay gap. Men see an even bigger jump in pay in their first postMBA role 76. This is false. PayScale has also conducted research on workers experiences with asking for a raise. They found that men and women of all races were equally likely to ask for a raise from their current employer but white men were far more likely to get the raise. The data shows otherwise. For example a 2020 survey of men and women working in the health tech industry asked what prevents women from reaching senior leadership. While both men and women acknowledged that gender bias is part of the problem men believed that women s biggest obstacle was a desire for worklife balance. Women said the most significant obstacle was their exclusion from networks of communication and influence. When men assume women aren t interested in certain projects or roles women miss out on opportunities to advance. On Equal Pay Day or any other day of the year if you hear someone try to explain the gender pay gap away by saying There s no pay gap where I work or My company has a woman VP you might want to enlighten them. And if you need some facts to back you up feel free to share a link to this article.
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/01/gender-pay-gap-facts/, As has long been the case the wage gap is smaller for workers ages 25 to 34 than for all workers 16 and older. In 2022 women ages 25 to 34 earned an average of 92 cents for every dollar earned by a man in the same age group an 8cent gap. By comparison the gender pay gap among workers of all ages that year was 18 cents. While the gender pay gap has not changed much in the last two decades it has narrowed considerably when looking at the longer term both among all workers ages 16 and older and among those ages 25 to 34. The estimated 18cent gender pay gap among all workers in 2022 was down from 35 cents in 1982. And the 8cent gap among workers ages 25 to 34 in 2022 was down from a 26cent gap four decades earlier. The gender pay gap measures the difference in median hourly earnings between men and women who work full or part time in the United States. Pew Research Center s estimate of the pay gap is based on an analysis of Current Population Survey CPS monthly outgoing rotation group files IPUMS from January 1982 to December 2022 combined to create annual files. To understand how we calculate the gender pay gap read our 2013 post How Pew Research Center measured the gender pay gap.  The COVID19 outbreak affected data collection efforts by the U.S. government in its surveys especially in 2020 and 2021 limiting inperson data collection and affecting response rates. It is possible that some measures of economic outcomes and how they vary across demographic groups are affected by these changes in data collection. In addition to findings about the gender wage gap this analysis includes information from a Pew Research Center survey about the perceived reasons for the pay gap as well as the pressures and career goals of U.S. men and women. The survey was conducted among 5098 adults and includes a subset of questions asked only for 2048 adults who are employed part time or full time from Oct. 1016 2022. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used in this analysis along with responses and its methodology. The U.S. Census Bureau has also analyzed the gender pay gap though its analysis looks only at fulltime workers as opposed to full and parttime workers. In 2021 fulltime yearround working women earned 84 of what their male counterparts earned on average according to the Census Bureau s most recent analysis. Much of the gender pay gap has been explained by measurable factors such as educational attainment occupational segregation and work experience. The narrowing of the gap over the long term is attributable in large part to gains women have made in each of these dimensions. Related The Enduring Grip of the Gender Pay Gap Even though women have increased their presence in higherpaying jobs traditionally dominated by men such as professional and managerial positions women as a whole continue to be overrepresented in lowerpaying occupations relative to their share of the workforce. This may contribute to gender differences in pay. Other factors that are difficult to measure including gender discrimination may also contribute to the ongoing wage discrepancy. When asked about the factors that may play a role in the gender wage gap half of U.S. adults point to women being treated differently by employers as a major reason according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted in October 2022. Smaller shares point to women making different choices about how to balance work and family 42 and working in jobs that pay less 34. There are some notable differences between men and women in views of what s behind the gender wage gap. Women are much more likely than men 61 vs. 37 to say a major reason for the gap is that employers treat women differently. And while 45 of women say a major factor is that women make different choices about how to balance work and family men are slightly less likely to hold that view 40 say this. Parents with children younger than 18 in the household are more likely than those who don t have young kids at home 48 vs. 40 to say a major reason for the pay gap is the choices that women make about how to balance family and work. On this question differences by parental status are evident among both men and women. Views about reasons for the gender wage gap also differ by party. About twothirds of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 68 say a major factor behind wage differences is that employers treat women differently but far fewer Republicans and Republican leaners 30 say the same. Conversely Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say women s choices about how to balance family and work 50 vs. 36 and their tendency to work in jobs that pay less 39 vs. 30 are major reasons why women earn less than men. Democratic and Republican women are more likely than their male counterparts in the same party to say a major reason for the gender wage gap is that employers treat women differently. About threequarters of Democratic women 76 say this compared with 59 of Democratic men. And while 43 of Republican women say unequal treatment by employers is a major reason for the gender wage gap just 18 of GOP men share that view. Family caregiving responsibilities bring different pressures for working women and men and research has shown that being a mother can reduce women s earnings while fatherhood can increase men s earnings. Employed women and men are about equally likely to say they feel a great deal of pressure to support their family financially and to be successful in their jobs and careers according to the Center s October survey. But women and particularly working mothers are more likely than men to say they feel a great deal of pressure to focus on responsibilities at home. About half of employed women 48 report feeling a great deal of pressure to focus on their responsibilities at home compared with 35 of employed men. Among working mothers with children younger than 18 in the household twothirds 67 say the same compared with 45 of working dads. When it comes to supporting their family financially similar shares of working moms and dads 57 vs. 62 report they feel a great deal of pressure but this is driven mainly by the large share of unmarried working mothers who say they feel a great deal of pressure in this regard 77. Among those who are married working dads are far more likely than working moms 60 vs. 43 to say they feel a great deal of pressure to support their family financially. There were not enough unmarried working fathers in the sample to analyze separately. About fourinten working parents say they feel a great deal of pressure to be successful at their job or career. These findings don t differ by gender. Overall a quarter of employed U.S. adults say they are currently the boss or one of the top managers where they work according to the Center s survey. Another 33 say they are not currently the boss but would like to be in the future while 41 are not and do not aspire to be the boss or one of the top managers. Men are more likely than women to be a boss or a top manager where they work 28 vs. 21. This is especially the case among employed fathers 35 of whom say they are the boss or one of the top managers where they work. The varying attitudes between fathers and men without children at least partly reflect differences in marital status and educational attainment between the two groups. In addition to being less likely than men to say they are currently the boss or a top manager at work women are also more likely to say they wouldn t want to be in this type of position in the future. More than fourinten employed women 46 say this compared with 37 of men. Similar shares of men 35 and women 31 say they are not currently the boss but would like to be one day. These patterns are similar among parents. Note This is an update of a post originally published on March 22 2019.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/06/06/dispelling-myths-about-the-gender-pay-gap/,  What really accounts for higher pay for men? A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit that Professor Jennifer Freyd filed against the University of Oregon for alleged genderbased pay discrimination. While it is widely reported that women face a pay gap when compared to men this lawsuit is a good example of how misleading that claim is. These unsupported claims along with such claims as women receive smaller firsttime research grants than their male colleagues are not in the best interest of women or men. It is obviously discouraging for women to be told that they will be paid less simply because of their gender and it disparages men to say that they haven t really earned their salaries or grants. These things are not true even though they are endlessly repeated. This post will start with the specifics of Professor Freyd s lawsuit and then discuss the research more generally. Freyd is a very distinguished professor of psychology at the University of Oregon and is widely published in her field. By coincidence a recent post of mine cites some of her research. As befits a professor of her stature she is well paid by her university. The federal decision dismissing her claim notes that she is compensated at a higher rate than the majority of professors in the University of Oregon s College of Arts and Sciences and that she is the sixteenth highest paid faculty member in her department of ninety professors.  Nonetheless Professor Freyd claims she is the victim of gender discrimination and cites as evidence that four of her male psychology colleagues are paid more than she is. The reason that her claim has been dismissed by the court is that all of these men have quite different responsibilities than she does. One of them also served as the Director of Clinical Training within the Psychology Department. Another founded the Center for Translational Neuroscience of which he is the current codirector. That professor s salary is offset by Harvard University because he performs work for Harvard a role for which he reports to that university directly. Another is the chair of the department. The fourth male professor was externally appointed to the Center on Diversity and Community as an interim director a universitywide role. The court lists several more reasons that the four particular men to whom Professor Freyd compares herself have significantly different job responsibilities than she does. Apart from the differences in job responsibilities the university found that Professor Freyd s colleagues had received retention raises meaning that they had received attractive enough offers from other schools that the University of Oregon had to raise their pay to retain them. Professor Freyd had never sought a retention raise. Interestingly her prior employer Cornell University did offer her a retention raise but she turned that money down to go to Oregon. What about the bigger picture? There are many media reports of a gender gap often claiming that women are paid only about 80 of what men are paid. But that number is comparing the total amount of salary paid to men and to women in this country. It does not take into account such crucial factors as profession qualifications type of employer seniority hours worked or many other things that go into deciding compensation. When these basic factors are taken into account the gender pay gap vastly decreases. For example PayScale issued a report entitled The State of Gender Pay Gap 2019 based on a survey of 1.8 million wage earners. It reported that women still make only 0.79 for every dollar men make in 2019. But the controlled pay gap the amount that a woman earns for every dollar that a comparable man earns was a small fraction of that. When comparing two people in the same profession with the same seniority working the same number of hours and so forth women earn 0.98 for every dollar that a man earns. Of course even a two penny per dollar gender pay gap is two pennies too much. However it is far from clear that even this small gap can be attributed to gender discrimination. As the Freyd lawsuit illustrates many factors go into a persons salary that won t be picked up even by surveys that ask about a persons profession hours worked etc. Especially for the more highly educated professions there are too many factors that go into compensation for even the bestdesigned studies to account for. Has the person aggressively pursued outside offers? Did he or she place a great deal of weight on salary when negotiating their job offer? Do they pursue side ventures that augment their income? Also in order to get statistically significant results studies need to be comparing reasonably large groups of men and women to one another. That means that these surveys generally compare say doctors to doctors not orthopedic surgeons to orthopedic surgeons. According to the American Medical Association men are overrepresented in various higherpaying specialties while women are overrepresented in various lowerpaying specialties. Therefore there is no reason to assume that even the two percent gap is a result of gender discrimination. The same is true about the widely reported finding that female researchers get smaller firsttime grants than male researchers. The report is comparing grant size without looking at the applications themselves. It does not take into account for example the size of the grant request. In other words the study does not report finding that female researchers are getting less of what they requested. If a female researcher asks for 100000 while a male researcher asks for 20 more and they both get fully funded that is not gender discrimination. One would be hardpressed to learn any of this from the breathless coverage of the study that would leave any reader with the impression that female researchers faced daunting discrimination and that almost uniformly failed to discuss the limited nature of the findings. Of course none of this closes the discussion on sexism. It is important to ask for example why women might not be as ambitious in asking for higher salaries or larger grants and why they gravitate to say pediatrics over orthopedic surgery. It is possible that gender discrimination significantly contributes to all this. But researchers should be asking the right questions. If nobody is asking whether women ask for smaller grants then universities won t find out what s behind that phenomenon if it is true. That doesn t help anybody. And it hardly encourages young women to go into science if they are being told without evidence that they will get stiffed on salary and grants if they do so.
https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/columnist/2023/03/14/equal-pay-day-myth-truth-income-women/11464213002/, It all sounds very maddening and unfair. Until you dig into the numbers and look at why this is the case.  When you do it becomes clear that government efforts to close the gap could make lives harder for women. As a woman I 100 want to be paid equally for equal work and think that should be the standard for all women. The good news is that this is already happening.  What these sound bites and news releases don t tell you is that this gap exists when job comparisons are not equal. When salaries for men and women are controlled for job title experience industry and hours worked the gap nearly disappears.  What weve seen historically is the choices that women make particularly when they are mothers are just going to naturally lead to lower earnings in part because theyre working fewer hours says Rachel Greszler a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. They might be giving up wages in turn for remote work or more flexible type of work or maybe certain types of benefits.  If Democrats got their wish and pushed through legislation like the Paycheck Fairness Act it could open employers to more lawsuits and force them to treat every employee exactly the same. In other words more government involvement would make businesses less likely to negotiate a flexible work schedule and perhaps less pay with a female employee for fear of getting sued.   We want to make sure that were not going to close more doors for women in an attempt to just bring up their wages Greszler says. 
https://ofboysandmen.substack.com/p/the-gender-pay-gap-is-not-a-myth, As I m out and about talking about boys and men I m often asked a question along the lines of well why is there still such a big gender pay gap then? It s a good question. And I provide what I think it a pretty good answer on pages 2329 of my book Of Boys and Men. Did I mention I d written a book? If you re more of a video kind of person do check out my latest for Big Think an explainer on the real causes of the gender pay gap  The gap instinct leads to two errors of perception. First we fail to see how much overlap there is between two groups. Second we fail to see the bigger gaps that typically exist within groups rather than between them. The gender pay gap is a case in point. A woman at the middle of the female wage distribution for fulltime yearround workers earns 82 as much as a man at the middle of the male one. When we hear about this gap the thought that naturally gets generated is women earn less than men. But in fact the distribution of women s wages looks strikingly similar to the distribution of men s wages and a lot more similar today than just a few decades ago. The figure below from the book shows the wage distribution for men and women working full time in 1979 and in 2019 The basic facts are not in dispute. As I have already said the typical i.e. median fulltime female worker earns about 82 as much as the typical man. The real disagreement is not over whether the typical woman earns less than the typical man but why.  There is certainly little evidence that women are paid less than men for doing the same work in the same way. Women are paid less because they do different work or work differently or both. But of course that is not the end of the story. Women may earn less because they occupy fewer senior positions but that fact itself may be the result of institutional sexism. Similarly it is true that women tend to be more clustered than men in lowerpaying occupations and industries which explains perhaps a third of the pay gap. But that may reflect socialized gender roles not least in terms of family responsibilities or a devaluation of work that is done by women or both. In any case while there is a pay gap between occupations there is as big a gender pay gap within occupations. Share Some of the best proof that the gender pay gap is mostly a parenting pay gap comes from innovative studies in Sweden and Norway comparing new mothers in samesex relationships with those in heterosexual relationships. Ylva Moberg shows that the impact on earnings for the birth mother is almost identical in both family types. Meanwhile the nonbirth mothers in the lesbian couples show a similar earnings pattern to fathers in the heterosexual ones. Over time the inequality seems to balance out in the lesbian couple if they have more than one child as each takes their turn at being the birth mother. For heterosexual couples by contrast the gap gets wider with each child. A study of bus and train drivers working for the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority MBTA by Valentin Bolotnyy and Natalia Emanuel a duo of Harvard economists provides some strong evidence here too. Women account for 30 of the drivers and on average earn 0.89 for every dollar earned by their male peers. By focusing on men and women doing the same job for the same employer Bolotnyy and Emanuel can tease out the various factors contributing to wage differ ences. They conclude that  The pay gap can be explained entirely by the fact that while having the same choice sets in the workplace women and men make different choices. The men were twice as likely to work overtime which pays extra even at short notice. They also took fewer hours of unpaid leave and so on. Among train drivers with children the gaps were even wider. Fathers wanted even more overtime pay mothers wanted more time off. For most women having a child is the economic equivalent of being hit by a meteorite. For most men it barely makes a dent.  On the other side progressives insist that the pay gap is the result of sexist discrimination. The impression is given that the cause of the gender wage gap is that women are paid less for doing the same or similar work as men.  This is not the case as every labor market economist knows. But strikingly people and especially women with higher someone s level of education are more likely to think that direct discrimination is the main cause of the gender pay gap. To my frustration even though I can literally see the numbers in my head I think from Gallup I can t lay my hands on the survey. So for now you ll have to trust me on this one or even better help me find the data.  That s clearly an ideological effect and a useful reminder that educational level is not a reliable predictor of the accuracy of a person s views on a particular topic. Especially if it a culturewar topic. That means reducing the sharpness of the trade off between raising a family and pursuing a career paging Claudia Goldin as well as increasing the share of childrearing undertaken by men.  You note that for most women having a child is the economic equivalent of being hit by a meteorite. For most men it barely makes a dent. You also say that mens income often goes up but dont say why. It suspect that men as they become fathers they take on more responsibility for making ends meet in the family by working overtime and seeking new more demanding jobs. Men are providers. Rather than denigrating men for making more we should honor their commitment to their families and making an effort to earn more income.

The other is Factfulness Ten Reasons Weu2019re Wrong about the Worldu2014 and Why Things Are Better Than You Think by Hans Rosling who is something of a hero to me. Rosling who died in 2017 was a Swedish physician who became obsessed with statistical illiteracy. In Factfulness he describes various biases including the u201Cstraight line instinctu201D an assumption that a historical trend line will continue unaltered into the future the u201Cnegativity instinctu201D which is a tendency to think things are likely getting worse and the u201Cgap instinctu201D which is a u201Cbasic urge to divide things into two distinct groups with nothing but an empty gap in between.u201D The gap instinct leads to two errors of perception.

https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/, Report Wages Report By Elise Gould Jessica Schieder and Kathleen Geier October 20 2016 Download PDF Press release Working women are paid less than working men. A large body of research accounts for diagnoses and investigates this gender pay gap. But this literature often becomes unwieldy for lay readers and because pay gaps are political topics ideological agendas often seep quickly into discussions. This primer examines the evidence surrounding the gender pay gap both in the literature and through our own data analyses. We will begin by explaining the different ways the gap is measured and then go deeper into the data using hourly wages for our analyses1 culling from extensive national and regional surveys of wages educational attainment and occupational employment. A number of figures are commonly used to describe the gender wage gap. One oftencited statistic comes from the Census Bureau which looks at annual pay of fulltime workers. By that measure women are paid 80 cents for every dollar men are paid. Another measure looks at hourly pay and does not exclude parttime workers. It finds that relative to men typical women are paid 83 cents on the dollar.2 Other lesscited measures show different gaps because they examine the gap at different parts of the wage distribution or for different demographic subgroups or are adjusted for factors such as education level and occupation. The presence of alternative ways to measure the gap can create a misconception that data on the gender wage gap are unreliable. However the data on the gender wage gap are remarkably clear and unfortunately consistent about the scale of the gap. In simple terms no matter how you measure it there is a gap. And different gaps answer different questions. By discussing the data and the rationale behind these seemingly contradictory measures of the wage gap we hope to improve the discourse around the gender wage gap. The most common analytical mistake people make when discussing the gender wage gap is to assume that as long as it is measured correctly it will tell us precisely how much genderbased discrimination affects what women are paid. Specifically some people note that the commonly cited measures of the gender wage gap do not control for workers demographic characteristics such measures are often labeled unadjusted. They speculate that the unadjusted gender wage gap could simply be reflecting other influences such as levels of education labor market experiences and occupations. And because gender wage gaps that are adjusted for workers characteristics through multivariate regression are often smaller than unadjusted measures people commonly infer that gender discrimination is a smaller problem in the American economy than thought. However the adjusted gender wage gap really only narrows the analysis to the potential role of gender discrimination along one dimension to differential pay for equivalent work. But this simple adjustment misses all of the potential differences in opportunities for men and women that affect and constrain the choices they make before they ever bargain with an employer over a wage. While multivariate regression can be used to distill the role of discrimination in the narrowest sense it cannot capture how discrimination affects differences in opportunity. In short one should have a very precise question that he or she hopes to answer using the data on the wage differences between men and women workers. We hope to provide this careful thinking in the questions we address in this primer. Given that gender wage gaps are strikingly persistent in economic data it is natural to then ask What causes these gaps? And further Do women s own choices and labor force characteristics drive the gender wage gap or are women s opportunities for higher pay constricted relative to men? Although this paper will largely focus on empirical data to answer questions about the size and scope of the gaps for different groups of women we will use the data to shed light on some of these why questions. The gender pay gap is a fraught topic. Discussions about it would benefit greatly from a thorough review of the empirical evidence. The data can answer only precise questions but the answers can help us work toward the broader questions. This paper aims to provide this precision in search of broader answers. Readers can access the data we analyze and report in this paper in the EPI State of Working America Data Library. By making the data publicly available and usable we hope to advance constructive discussions of the gender pay gap. The gender wage gap is a measure of pay disparity between men and women. While it can be measured different ways the data are clear women are still paid much less relative to men about 83 cents per dollar by our measure and progress on closing the gap has stalled. 82.7 percent of men s wages. This translates to 83 cents per dollar. The typical median woman is paid 83 cents per every dollar the typical man is paid. 3.27 less per hour than men. The median hourly wage is 15.67 for women and 18.94 for men. The gender wage gap is a measure of what women are paid relative to men. It is commonly calculated by dividing women s wages by men s wages and this ratio is often expressed as a percent or in dollar terms. This tells us how much a woman is paid for each dollar paid to a man. This gender pay ratio is often measured for yearround fulltime workers and compares the annual wages of hourly wage and salaried workers of the median typical man with that of the median typical woman measured this way the current gender pay ratio is 0.796 or expressed as a percent it is 79.6 percent U.S. Census Bureau 2016. In other words for every dollar a man makes a woman makes about 80 cents. The difference in earnings between men and women is also sometimes described in terms of how much less women make than men. To calculate this gap from the ratio as defined above simply subtract the ratio from 1. So if the gender pay ratio is about 80 percent or 80 cents on the dollar this means that women are paid 20 percent less or 20 cents less per dollar than men. A larger difference between men s and women s earnings translates into a lower ratio but a larger gap in their earnings. We keep with this convention of using median wages of wage and salary workers rather than average wages of wage and salary workers because averages can be skewed by a handful of people making much more or much less than the rest of workers in a sample. However we examine median wages on an hourly basis and include all workers reporting a positive number of work hours. This hourly measure constitutes a limited adjustment in research methodology in that it accounts for the fact that men work more hours on average during the year and that more women work part time. 5 This limited adjustment allows us to compare women s and men s wages without assuming that women who still shoulder a disproportionate amount of responsibilities at home would be able or willing to work as many hours as their male counterparts. Computed this way using data from the federal government s Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group or CPS ORG in shorthand the typical woman is paid 82.7 percent of what the typical man is paid CPS ORG 2015. Or in common terms women are paid 83 cents on the male dollar. Notwithstanding our limited adjustment this is basically the raw or unadjusted gap that we explore throughout this report when we consider the ways a large basket of factors interact and create the wage gap women experience when they cash their paychecks. Adjustments can help round out our understanding but unfortunately as we explain here they don t explain away the gap. It is important to understand why. The gender wage gap described above and referred to in this primer has the virtue of being clear and simple. It provides a good overview of what is going on with typical women s earnings relative to men s. But it does not tell us what the wage gap is between men and women doing similar work and whether the size of the gap derives in part from differences in education levels experience levels and other characteristics of working men and women. To round out our understanding of the disparity between men s and women s pay we also consider adjusted measures of the gender wage gap with the caveat that the adjusted measures may understate the wage disparities. Adjusted wage gap estimates control for characteristics such as race and ethnicity level of education potential work experience and geographic division. These estimate are made using average wages rather than median because it requires standard regression techniques. Again using the Current Population Survey data from the CPS Outgoing Rotation Group but making these adjustments we find that the wage gap grows with women on average paid 21.7 percent less than men.6 The unadjusted penalty for the average woman is 17.9 percent.7 The measured penalty actually increases when accounting for these influences because women workers on average have higher levels of education than men.8 Models that control for a much larger set of variables such as occupation industry or work hours are sometimes used to isolate the role of discrimination in setting wages for specific jobs and workers. The notion is that if we can control for these factors the wage gap will shrink and what is left can be attributed to discrimination. Think of a man and woman with identical education and years of experience working sidebyside in cubicles but who are paid different wages because of discriminatory paysetting practices. We also run a model with more of these controls and find that the wage gap shrinks slightly from the unadjusted measure from 17.9 percent to 13.5 percent.9 Researchers have used more extensive datasets to examine these differences. For instance Blau and Kahn 2016 find an unadjusted penalty of 20.7 percent a partially adjusted penalty of 17.9 percent and a fully adjusted penalty of 8.4 percent.10 But switching to a fully adjusted model of the gender wage gap actually can radically understate the effect of gender discrimination on women s earnings. This is because gender discrimination doesn t happen only in the paysetting practices of employers making wage offers to nearly identical workers of different genders. Instead it can potentially happen at every stage of a woman s life from girlhood to moving through the labor market. By the time she completes her education and embarks on her career a woman s occupational choice is the culmination of years of education guidance by mentors expectations of parents and other influential adults hiring practices of firms and widespread norms and expectations about workfamily balance held by employers coworkers and society Gould and Schieder 2016. So it would not be accurate to assume that discrimination explains only the gender wage gap that remains after adjusting for education occupational choice and all these other factors. Put another way we cannot look at our adjusted model and say that discrimination explains at most 13.5 percent of the gender wage gap. Why? Because for example by controlling for occupation this adjusted wage gap no longer includes the discrimination that can influence a woman s occupational choice. The average woman worker loses more than 530000 over the course of her lifetime because of the gender wage gap and the average collegeeducated woman loses even more nearly 800000 IWPR 2016. It s worth noting that each woman s losses will vary significantly based on a variety of factors including the health of the economy at various points in her life her education and duration of periods out of the labor force but this estimate demonstrates the significance of the cumulative impact. And as explained later the gap may play a role in the retirement insecurity of older American women. Over the past three and a half decades substantial progress has been made to narrow the pay gap. Women s wages are now significantly closer to men s but in recent years that progress has stalled. From 1979 to the early 1990s the ratio of women s median hourly earnings to men s hourly median earnings grew partly because women made disproportionate gains in education and labor force participation. After that convergence slowed and over the past two decades it has stalled. According to the most recent data as of 2015 women s hourly wages are 82.7 percent of men s hourly wages at the median Figure A with the median woman paid an hourly wage of 15.67 compared with 18.94 for men Figure B.

It s not entirely clear why women have stopped gaining on men. But as discussed later in the section on the motherhood penalty the tendency for women with children to receive systematically lower pay has stubbornly persisted suggesting that the gender pay gap is not going away anytime soon. Economist Claudia Goldin s research supports this conclusion. According to Goldin current trends indicate that women s wages will still be pulled down over the course of their working lifetimes even after controlling for education and work time Goldin 2014. Since 1979 median men s wages have stagnated falling 6.7 percent in real terms from 20.30 per hour to 18.94 Figure C. At the same time women s real median hourly wages have increased. In 1979 they were equal to roughly 62.4 percent of men s real median hourly wages. By 2015 they were equal to 82.7 percent of men s real wages at the median a substantial reduction in the wage gap. Unfortunately this means that about 30 percent of the reduction was due to the decline in men s wages. The stagnation and decline of median men s wages has played a significant role in the decline in the unadjusted gender wage gap. Women s wages increased as more women had increased their participation in the labor force increased their educational attainment and entered higherpaying occupations. Davis and Gould 2015. At the same time for most workers wages no longer increased with increases in economywide productivity. Had workers wages continued to keep pace with productivity both men and women would be earning much more today. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group microdata.

It affects women across the board though higherearning women and middleage women are at a greater disadvantage relative to their male counterparts. And relative to white male wages black and Hispanic women are the most disadvantaged. The gender wage gap is a problem for women at every wage level. At each and every point in the wage distribution men significantly outearn women although by different amounts to be sure Figures B and C. In 2015 the gap between men s and women s hourly wages was smallest among the lowestearning workers with 10th percentile women earning 92.0 percent of men s wages. The minimum wage is partially responsible for this greater equality among the lowest earners. It sets a wage floor that applies to everyone which means that people near the bottom of the distribution are likely to make more equal wages even though those wages are very low Figure D. Notes The xthpercentile wage is the wage at which x of wage earners earn less and 100x earn more. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation group microdata At the median women s hourly wages are equal to 82.7 percent of men s wages. The gender wage gap is largest at the top of the wage distribution with women at the 95th percentile getting paid 73.8 percent of wages at the male 95th percentile. Economist Claudia Goldin argues that women in highwage professions experience a wider gender gap because they are penalized for not working long inflexible hours Goldin 2014. Such rigorous work schedules tend to weigh disproportionately heavily on women who are still responsible for more housework and childelder care than men. It is interesting to note that the wage gap between median men and women workers has narrowed noticeably over the past four decades Hegewisch and DuMonthier 2016. At the low end the gap has not closed as much but the existence of the minimum wage likely kept wages of lowpaid men and women closer together even in the 1970s. And the relatively fast growth of men s wages at the 95th percentile has kept this gap from closing as much as the median gap Economic Policy Institute 2016. Relative wage gaps are larger for highwage white and Asian women but black and Hispanic women are paid least relative to white men. Figure E looks at low middle and highwage women and compares their wages with those of men within their same racial and ethnic group. Here higherwage white and Asian women are paid the least relative to their male peers i.e. the gender wage gap is largest among highearning whites and Asians. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey microdata When we compare the wages of white women and women of color with wages of white men white and Asian women fare better than their black and Hispanic counterparts Figure F. White nonHispanic women are paid 81.0 percent and Asian women 89.8 percent of what nonHispanic white men make. But the shares are much lower for black and Hispanic women at 65.3 percent and 57.6 percent respectively CPS ORG 2011 2015. Notes Values displayed above columns represent the difference between womens median hourly wages and median hourly wages of white men. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey microdata 2015 In terms of the impact on women s paychecks this means that relative to the typical white man the typical white woman takes home 4.00 less per hour black women take home 7.31 less per hour Hispanic women take home 8.91 less per hour and Asian women take home 2.15 less per hour. Nativeborn workers of either gender are paid more per hour than nonnaturalized foreignborn workers Figure G. However nonnaturalized foreignborn women like their nativeborn counterparts experience a wage gap that further reduces their earnings. The typical nonnaturalized foreignborn woman is paid 80 cents per dollar of what a foreignborn man is paid 11.26 as a share of 14.02. Among undocumented Mexican immigrants the gender wage gap is wider for every dollar a man is paid a woman is paid 71 cents Garcia and Oakford 2013. Notes Includes individuals older than 16. The category native born includes individuals born in the United States Puerto Rico and U.S. outlying areas as well as individuals born abroad of American parents. The category foreign born includes foreignborn individuals who are not citizens of the United States. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey microdata So while foreignborn workers overall are disadvantaged in terms of wages nonnaturalized foreignborn women are additionally disadvantaged by the gender wage gap. Compared with nativeborn men the average foreignborn woman is paid 58.4 cents on the dollar. Foreignborn naturalized workers not only earn higher wages than their nonnaturalized and nativeborn counterparts but have a slightly smaller gender wage gap. The gender wage gap is quite small for workers in their teens and early 20s but the gap grows with age Figure H. For typical working men hourly wages rise until around the age of 45 and then plateau but for typical working women hourly wages top off earlier in the 35 to 44 age range. After around 40 women s wage growth plateaus and then drops off earlier than men s. This holds true when measuring the gap using median weekly earnings of fulltime wage and salary workers Hill 2016. The growth in the gender wage gap during this time of life reflects the disproportionate impact of family responsibilities on women s careers. Other research shows that from the beginning of their working lives women experience a gender wage gap that is still expected to swell significantly over the course of their careers regardless of education or work experience Goldin 2014. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey microdata Women s experience levels and work schedules do factor into the gender wage gap. Rather than disproving the role of discrimination work experience hours and schedules in part reflect the social expectations that still disadvantage women. These influences all play a role in the motherhood wage penalty evident in the data. On average women have less work experience than men and this contributes to the gender wage gap. But it would not be correct to conclude that this helps disprove the role of discrimination because the lack of experience itself is a function of social expectations and norms that disadvantage women in the workplace. Women are more likely to temporarily exit the labor force most often to raise children although increasingly to care for an older relative which leaves them with less work experience. One study of workers with MBAs showed that a year after receiving the degree only 4 percent of men had experienced a career interruption of six months or more compared with 9 percent of women Goldin 2014. Further out from their schooling the gap grows after 10 years 10 percent of men had experienced a career interruption compared with 32 percent of women experiencing a career interruption nine years out. And in the 10 to 16 years following graduation with an MBA 40 percent of women had experienced a career interruption. Bertrand Goldin and Katz 2009 Women tend to work different hours than men which affects their earnings. However the story is different depending on wage level. Women are more likely than men to work lowwage jobs and lowwage workers are more likely to experience irregular work schedules such as irregular shift times or oncall shifts than are other workers Golden 2015 Davis and Gould 2015. For lowwage parents especially irregular schedules often associated with pay that changes from paycheck to paycheck can be paralyzing as they try to coordinate childcare and meet basic household needs. Among higherwage workers firms tend to disproportionately reward those who work long and particular hours and those individuals are more likely to be men which creates a wider wage gap for higherwage women Hersch and Stratton 2002 Goldin 2014. But when workers have more temporal flexibility that is more choice as to the schedules and number of hours they work the gender gap narrows. In fact Goldin 2014 finds that temporal inflexibility is an important contributor to the gender gap. Long inflexible work schedules tend to weigh disproportionately heavily on women who are still responsible for more housework and childelder care than men. Women are also roughly twice as likely to work part time as men 24.5 percent of women work part time versus 12.4 percent of men Golden 2016. The biggest disadvantage parttime workers face is their relatively lower rates of pay and benefits coverage relative to fulltime workers. When adjusting for differences in personal educational locational industrial and occupational characteristics of the workers women who work part time earn 9 percent less than fulltime working women. Disadvantages are compounded when women work part time involuntarily they are willing and able to work full time but can only obtain parttime work. Women of color are disproportionately involuntarily part time. What we do know is that in recent decades women have been working substantially more hours. Between 1979 and 2012 the median annual hours worked by women increased by 739 hours Appelbaum Boushey and Schmitt 2014. Median annual hours of work by mothers increased even more dramatically rising 960 hours from 1979 to 2012 Appelbaum Boushey and Schmitt 2014. For mothers and for women overall all of the increase in work hours took place by 2000 Appelbaum Boushey and Schmitt 2014. Despite these advances women still work fewer paid hours than men OECD 2016. Research has consistently shown that women with children are paid less than women without children and men with or without children.11 In short there does seem to be a motherhood penalty for earnings. Even after researchers control for variables such as education and experience they find that mothers are paid approximately 4.6 percent less on an hourly basis than women who are not mothers Budig 2014. Compared with their counterparts 40 years ago firsttime mothers today are older and have more education and work experience after giving birth they are less likely to leave the labor force and more likely to return to work quickly Laughlin 2011. Despite women s greater experience education and attachment to the labor force the motherhood pay penalty persists Budig 2014. Our research on the work hours of parents finds that women with children under the age of 6 work 5.5 hours less per week 13.4 percent fewer weekly hours than the average working man while women without children work 4.1 hours less per week 10.1 percent fewer hours than the average man Figure I. Notes Sample is limited to primeage workers workers age 25 54 with positive average weekly hours worked. Source EPI analysis of the March Current Population Survey Our research also looks at labor force participation which is generally defined as the share of a given population that is in the labor force i.e. that is working or looking for work. Because of social norms and home responsibility women in general are less likely to work than men. As shown in Figure J 71.0 percent of all mothers are in the labor force as are 73.8 percent of all primeage women and 88.3 percent of all primeage men.12 It s particularly striking that labor force attachment of parents differs for men and women fathers are more likely to be in the labor force than are men without children but mothers are less likely to be in the labor force than are women without children. Note Sample limited to people ages 25 54. Children are defined as being less than 18 years old. The labor force participation rate is the percentage of people who either have a job or are actively looking for a job and are not on active duty in the Armed Forces or living in institutions such as correctional facilities or nursing homes. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey microdata Some have suggested that women could narrow the wage gap if they made different educational or occupational choices. The data suggest it s not that simple. One thing the data clearly show is that women have not been able to educate themselves out of the gender wage gap at least in terms of broad formal credentials. While women are more likely to graduate from college than men and are more likely to receive a graduate degree than men Gould and Schieder 2016 at every education level women are paid less than men Figure K. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation Group microdata. For more information on the data sample see EPIs State of Working America Data Library. Among workers who have not completed high school women are paid 78.2 percent of what men are paid. Among workers who have a college degree the share is 75.2 percent and among workers who have an advanced degree it is 73.4 percent. Women with advanced degrees still make less per hour than men with college degrees. Even straight out of college women with a college degree make 4 less per hour than their male peers a gap that has grown since 2000 Kroeger Cooke and Gould 2016. Part of the gender wage gap can be attributed to college major. Women are more likely to major in subjects such as education and the humanities and these majors are associated with lowerpaying jobs after graduation. At the same time fewer women major in the STEM science technology engineering and math subjects which are associated with the most lucrative jobs Corbett and Hill 2015. Although college major doesn t always determine occupation after graduation there is a link between major and salary in the workforce. Figure L shows that people with college degrees in majors favored by women are making less 10 years after graduation. For example engineering majors are paid on average nearly twice as much as education majors 10 years after graduation. Notes Salaries are based on the current or most recent salary of college graduates of the class of 1993 10 years after graduation in 2003. The salaries are then inflated to 2015 dollars using the CPIU for easier comparison with todays wages. The percentage of graduates who are female by major is based on a survey of college students graduating in 1993 for consistency. Source U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics B B 9303 Baccalaureate and Beyond Longitudinal Study Contrary to what some may believe educational choices remain gendered today. For example male seniors graduating in 2008 were more than five times as likely as their female counterparts to have majored in engineering and engineering technology while women in that same year were three times as likely as their male counterparts to have studied education NCES 2011 2015. These choices of college majors however should not be seen as completely unconstrained. Women s experiences before college strongly influence their college trajectories. For example women arrive in college less interested in STEM fields than their male counterparts. Only 14 percent of firsttime college women chose sciencerelated fields in 2012 compared with 39 percent of firsttime college men OECD 2015. Among STEM majors women are disproportionately in the biological and life sciences while men dominate engineering and computer science Corbett and Hill 2015. A gender pay gap exists both within and between industries and occupations Goldin 2014. This means that occupations that have more women in them tend to pay less the between occupation wage gap and that within each occupation whether male or femaledominated men tend to be paid more than women the withinoccupation gap. This withinoccupation gap means that even when men and women work in the same occupation whether as hairdressers cosmetologists nurses teachers computer engineers mechanical engineers or construction workers men make more on average than women CPS ORG 20112015. Some have argued that the gender wage gap mostly reflects choices women make about career paths and choices about occupation in particular. But as it turns out the withinoccupation gender wage gap plays a larger role in the occupational gender wage gap than the betweenoccupation wage gap the fact that both men and women in occupations with higher shares of women are paid less. As a thought experiment imagine all women are picked out of their jobs and dropped into jobs to mirror how men are distributed throughout the occupational labor market. For example if 1.22 percent of men are currently software developers suppose 1.22 percent of women instead of today s 0.33 percent of women became software developers.13 What would this occupational reassignment of women do to the wage gap? Claudia Goldin imagines this scenario in a 2014 paper Goldin 2014. After controlling for differences in education and preferences for fulltime work she finds that only 32 percent of the gender pay gap for college graduates would be closed by redistributing women and men across occupations. On the other hand as much as 68 percent of the gender pay gap by occupation for college graduates is due to the withinoccupation gap Goldin 2014.14 This means if you left women in their current occupations and just closed the gaps between women and their male counterparts within occupations e.g. if male and female civil engineers and male and female teachers made the same per hour that would close a whopping 68 percent of the gap. Furthermore evidence shows that as women s participation in a particular occupation rises pay within that occupation falls Miller 2016 Oldenziel 1999. Some researchers attribute this phenomenon to devaluation in which employers ascribe a lower value to work done in femaledominated occupations and thus pay them less Levanon England and Allison 2009. Therefore changing which occupations women are in will only partially close the gender wage gap. If we want to equalize earnings between men and women we need to pay as much attention to the fact that women in the same job make less than men as we do to the fact that femaledominated professions pay less. This is a trick question. From the early 1960s to the 1990s more men and women moved into nontraditional occupations. An occupation is considered nontraditional for a particular gender if that gender constitutes less than 25 percent of employees in the occupation Carl D. Perkins Career and Technical Education Improvement Act of 2006.15 So for example more women found jobs in recreation and more men became nurses Landivar 2013 Miller 2016. But the movement toward gender integration in occupations slowed down after the 1990s and came to a complete halt during the 2000s Hegewisch and Hartmann 2014. Gen Xers who reached their mid40s mainly in the 2010s saw an increase in occupational segregation between ages 25 and 45. In fact virtually all cohorts of workers all saw a small increase in occupational segregation in the 2000s and 2010s Hegewisch and Hartmann 2014. For all our progress as of recent years only about 6 percent of women are employed in nontraditional i.e. traditionally male occupations. These same sets of occupations employ 45 percent of all men. At the same time only about 5 percent of men are in traditionally female occupations while these occupations employ 40 percent of all female workers. Figure M shows more simply how gender segregated our occupations still are in the United States. More than 40 percent of workers are in occupations in which more than threefourths of workers are of one gender. Notes We define genderedoccupations as occupations in which more than 75 percent of workers are of one gender. This definition is based on the definition of traditional occupations included in the Carl D. Perkins Vocational and Technical Education Act of 1998 S.2506. Employment counts are averaged over the time period 20112015. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey Outgoing Rotation group data And this segregated distribution of men and women across jobs matters to the gender wage gap. Occupation and industry taken together account for about half of the overall gender wage gap Blau and Kahn 2016. Finally it is important to note that the distribution of men and women across occupations is not a simple matter of unconstrained choice. Much research suggests that many women are driven out of nontraditional occupations by hostile work environments. For example 63 percent of women working in science engineering and technology experience sexual harassment Hewlett et al. 2008. Over time 52 percent of women in science engineering and technology quit their jobs half of whom end up leaving these fields altogether Hewlett et al. 2008. Unions not only raise wages for male and female workers alike but also reduce the size of the gender wage gap. Women in unions are paid 31 percent more than their nonunionized sisters. Among racial and ethnic subgroups black Hispanic and white women in unions make 34 42 and 31 percent more than their nonunion counterparts Anderson Hegewisch and Hayes 2015.16 Unionization raises women s wages by 11.2 percent compared with nonunion women who have similar characteristics Schmitt 2008. Women in unions also experience a smaller gender pay gap than their nonunionized counterparts Figure N. Women workers in unions are paid 88.7 percent of what their male counterparts are paid while for nonunionized women the share is 81.8 percent Anderson Hegewisch and Hayes 2015.  Notes The values represent the difference between the median weekly earnings of fulltime wage and salary workers who are union members or are covered by a union contract and those who are not. Source EPI analysis of Anderson Hegewisch and Hayes 2015 Yes. The gender wage gap varies widely by state. The gender wage gap as measured by women s share of men s hourly wages at the median ranges from 74.8 percent in Wyoming to 92.9 percent in Washington D.C. Figure O. Typical female workers in Washington D.C. and Vermont make more than 90 percent of the wages of their male counterparts. In nine states women are paid less than 80 percent of their male counterparts wages. Similarly the gender gap in annual earnings ranges from 65.3 percent in Louisiana to 89.5 percent in Washington D.C. NWLC 2015. Notes Values represent averages 20132015. Source EPI analysis of Current Population Survey microdata A number of factors may be contributing to these differences such as the mix of predominant industries or cultural differences. For example after holding other factors constant states with a higher score of religiosity including higher frequency of prayer worship service attendance and expressed belief in prayer among other measures experience a wider gender wage gap Wiseman and Dutta 2016. According to the researchers the reason for this is that religiosity is often associated with more traditional views about gender roles. The raw gender wage gap is larger in rural areas than in urban areas. In metropolitan areas the gender gap in median hourly wages is 83.2 percent while in nonmetropolitan areas it is 81.7 percent. The gender pay gap in the United States is bigger than the gap in many other developed countries. The gender pay gap in the United States is larger than the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD average when considering the difference between the wages of fulltime annual median male and female wages. Within the OECD the United States has the 12th largest gender gap overall and the U.S. gap is bigger than the gap in most European countries. That said making direct international comparisons is often difficult. For example parttime work by one parent is more common in Europe as is substantial use of parental leave and paid vacations while single parenthood is more common in the United States Ruhm 2011. A common thread in these data is that the burden of parenthood is distributed differently in various countries. This means that policies meant to address the motherhood penalty likely need to be tailored differently across these countries as well. For example the availability of parental leave might make a woman in Europe less likely to leave her employer following her pregnancy whereas in the United States taking any significant amount of time off at all following childbirth might lead to her losing her job. On the other hand in many of the OECD countries women are less likely to work full time and less likely to attain highlevel positions than are women in the United States suggesting that flexibility comes at a cost Blau and Kahn 2013a. There is another way in which geography might affect the gender wage gap. Women are more willing to move for a husband s employment than vice versa Abraham Auspurg and Hinz 2010. This suggests that women are less able to widen the geographic net over which to search for good job opportunities. It is hard to isolate the effect of the gender wage gap on American women s retirement security. According to the U.S. Department of Labor women s lower lifetime earnings means that they receive lower Social Security payments and experience fewer opportunities to save for retirement. Average annual Social Security benefits for women are only 13392 and the annual median income in retirement for women is only 14000 well below the 19000 to 29000 that a single person needs to live in retirement depending on geographic area DOL 2015. That may be a key reason why elderly women are more likely than elderly men to be economically vulnerable defined as earning less than twice what they would need to earn to be above the supplemental poverty measure. As shown in Figure P over half 52.5 percent of American women age 65 or older are economically vulnerable compared with 41.9 percent of sameaged men. Source EPI analysis of pooled 2010 2012 Current Population Survey Annual Social and Economic Supplement microdata But the gender wage gap is not the only factor that contributes to women s lower lifetime earnings. Women s caregiving responsibilities often push them into working fewer hours and working part time often limits opportunities for advancement. Women s time out of the workforce translates into lower earnings and can often erode women s early and midlife savings. Further caregiving costs women 274044 142693 in lost wages and 131351 in lost Social Security over their lifetime plus an additional 50000 in lost pension income DOL 2015. In addition to their lower Social Security and retirement earnings older women also have limited opportunities to earn money in the labor force. Not only is the gender pay gap highest among workers age 55 to 64 but recent studies suggest that women face robust age discrimination in the labor market and that age discrimination against women is worse than it is for men Neumark Burn and Button 2015 Farber Silverman and von Wachter 2015. Since working longer later in life yields less than it would for a man DOL 2015 this leaves less room for women to catch up on retirement savings. It also means that when older women are given a choice between staying home to care for family or staying in the workplace the latter option is relatively less advantageous. In a recent survey onefifth of all women ages 45 to 74 reported that they had taken time off work within the past five years to act as caregivers DOL 2015. Older women s caregiving responsibilities extend not just to their children but also to their parents. About 9.7 million Americans over age 50 care for their parents and women are the majority of the caregivers. The labor force participation rate of older women has grown in the past two decades but it is still lower than older men s DOL 2015. In 2012 35.1 percent of women ages 55 and older were in the labor force compared with 46.8 percent of their male counterparts DOL 2015. In 1992 those figures for older women and older men were 22.8 percent and 38.4 percent respectively DOL 2015. The unexplained or residual portion of the pay gap is the difference in pay between men and women who are observationally identical. It is what is left when researchers control for all observable characteristics. It is due to factors that are otherwise difficult to measure which could include not only discrimination but also differences in productivity that are unrelated to influences such as educational level and experience. What can the size and trajectory of this residual gap tell us about the scope of discrimination in the workplace? Even when researchers control for all observable characteristics a portion of the gender wage gap is left unexplained. Economists often argue that this unexplained portion while not synonymous with discrimination may tell us how much gender discrimination could be affecting wages. By this measure discrimination is either stable or increasing. In a 2016 study economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn found that the unexplained portion of the gender wage gap narrowed dramatically in the 1980s shrinking from between 21 and 29 percent of the gap in 1980 to between 8 and 18 percent of the gap in 1989. However after 1989 the unexplained portion of the gap did not narrow any further and it has remained stable ever since. In a 2014 study economist Claudia Goldin found that the unexplained or residual gap makes up more of the gap today than it did in the 1980s. Women today have more education and work experience which has whittled away the influence of those factors on the gap. Human capital factors such as education and experience made up about 25 percent of the wage gap in 1979 but only 8 percent in 1998. This residual gap is not uniform across occupations. Goldin argues that some professions disproportionately reward those who work very long hours and this might explain why she finds a larger residual gap in business occupations than in science and technology fields. Also some highwage firms have adopted paysetting practices that disproportionately reward individuals who work very long and very particular hours including weekends or late nights. This means that even if men and women are equally productive per hour individuals in these firms who are more likely to work a very high number of weekly hours and be available at particular off hours are paid more. This reward of long and nonstandard hours for highly credentialed employees works to men s advantage Hersch and Stratton 2002 Goldin 2014. But expansion or contraction of the residual gap does not mean that discrimination is expanding or contracting to the same degree because the residual wage gap only captures discrimination in paysetting between similar workers. It does not capture the range of factors that influence the different labor market experience of men and women before employers make hourly pay offers and discrimination in the form of societywide constraints on choices can certainly enter into these factors. For example women s choice of college major or occupation is conditioned on how well educated in science and math they were in college and even before. If gender differences in teachers attention or perception of academic excellence influence these choices about college major and occupation then it will affect pay outcomes. Therefore controlling for current occupation disguises how discrimination can filter men and women differently into high or lowpaying occupations. While we can t precisely measure how big the role of discrimination is or set a ceiling on its impact we do know that it exists. Empirical evidence of outright discrimination in hiring promotions and even wagesetting is strong and includes the following As noted the unexplained or residual portion of the pay gap is the difference in pay between men and women who are observationally identical. Some argue that one of the difficulttomeasure factors is differences in productivity that are unrelated to influences such as educational level and experience. Some argue that women s disproportionate childcare responsibilities may make them less productive. Studies that have directly explored worker productivity show little evidence of a motherhood penalty on productivity. Recent research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis that examined productivity among academic economists found that over the course of a career women with children were more productive than women without children Krapf Ursprung and Zimmerman 2014. Additionally women with two children were more productive than women with one child. Another study of bluecollar workers a group chosen because of the belief that there would likely be productivity differences by gender found that women were generally as productive as men Petersen Snartland and Milgrom 2006. In fact research on impressions of women in the workplace suggests women s productivity might in fact be systematically underestimated Burgess 2013. Researchers have noted that women are caught in a paradox between appearing too feminine not qualified and not feminine enough lacking in social skills which often causes their performance to be evaluated much more strictly than men s Burgess 2013. The same study found that mothers were seen as less competent than childless women Burgess 2013. For men parenthood status had no effect on their perceived competency. Another study found both men and women were conflicted by the notion that they should put work before family and other personal affairs Reid 2015. Women however were much less likely to be perceived as putting work first. Framing the question of pay fairness as this question does implies that men s pay is very closely aligned with their productivity. But in fact for decades the wages of the vast majority of both men and women have not kept pace with economywide productivity as productivity continued to increase but wages largely stagnated. This contrasts with the decades before about 1980 when wage growth and productivity growth were closely linked. If wages had continued to grow with productivity the vast majority of both women and men would be better off today Figure Q. For example Davis and Gould 2015 have shown that had the gender wage gap closed and had wages grown with productivity since 1979 the median woman s wages would be nearly 70 percent higher today.

Our society s institutions and norms exert a powerful influence on what choices are available and what form they take. One study found that parents are more likely to expect their sons rather than their daughters to work in STEM fields even when their daughters performed at the same level in mathematics OECD 2015. This suggests that cultural norms influence girls confidence which in turn influences their success Herbert and Stipek 2005. Though girls are underrepresented among students with the highest math test scores research shows that this gap differs geographically. In areas where people were more likely to say women are better suited for home and math is for boys girls were more likely to have lower math scores and higher scores on reading tests Pope and Syndor 2010. In the same states where girls had stereotypically gendernormative test scores boys scored higher in math than girls but also lower in reading. More evidence that children s disparate test scores may be the result of cultural factors not innate differences is found in the fact that in some states girls scored better at subjects in which cultural cues might have suggested they should be more gifted and the same was true for boys. Other research shows that gender bias among teachers negatively affects girls with the worst effects for girls in less welloff families and girls whose fathers have more years of schooling than their mothers Lavy and Sands 2015. Cultural attitudes also affect girls confidence which in turn affects their math performance OECD 2015. One study found that girls are more likely to express feelings of anxiety over mathematics and on average their math scores were lower. But among girls who reported similar levels of confidence as boys the gender gap in performance disappeared OECD 2015. Cultural stereotypes appear to have a direct impact on academic performance OECD 2015. Asians for example are stereotyped as being good at math. When Asian girls were told they were taking a quantitative skills test to assess ethnic differences in performance they scored higher than a control group which was given no explanation for why they were taking the test. By contrast Asian girls scored worse when they were told they were taking a quantitative assessment to determine gender differences. In college girls are less likely to major in STEM subjects than men and are less likely to major in STEM than in other subjects. Yet STEM majors are associated with the highest earnings. But even though they are not studying the subjects that lead to the most lucrative jobs women s level of education continues to increase. Today women earn more than half of all associate degrees bachelor s degrees master s degrees and Ph.D.s although in this last category they make up only 51 percent of recipients. One obstacle to increasing women s share of employment in lucrative fields is the attrition rate of highly qualified women working in science engineering and technology SET fields. One study found that as many as half of highly qualified female SET professionals left their jobs because of hostile work environments and job pressures at odds with traditionally gendered domestic roles Hewlett et al. 2008. Yet the gender wage gap persists even among recent graduates Gould and Kroeger 2016. In some fields particularly among highly credentialed workers in very wellpaid occupations employees are disproportionately rewarded for working very long hours andor at inconvenient times with short notice. There seems to be little compelling evidence that this reflects smart economic thinking by employers. For example productivity suffers for employees in medical fields who work long hours Lockley et al. 2007. Yet these practices persist and affect women. As noted earlier women in highwage professions experience a wider gender gap because they are penalized for not working long inflexible hours. Such rigorous work schedules tend to weigh disproportionately heavily on women who are still responsible for more housework and childelder care than men. But in the United States and around the world when unpaid work is accounted for women do more work than men reflecting again the social expectation that women disproportionately undertake nonmarket work. This trend holds even for children Although girls spend more time doing chores than boys they are less likely than boys to be paid an allowance University of Michigan 2007. Sex segregation in occupations is a reality women dominate some occupations just as men dominated others. However when women enter maledominated occupations they have similar or lower expected wages than their female counterparts who go into femaledominated occupations Pitts 2002. This suggests that when women enter femaledominated occupations they are rationally situating themselves to be paid higher wages once discrimination is taken into account. Another study Hwang and Polachek 2004 found that women choose female jobs to earn a relatively greater amenity package than they would have received elsewhere. Similarly men choose male jobs to earn relatively more.  It is often suggested that women who are planning to have children seek out motherfriendly occupations sacrificing higher pay for work environments that are more conducive to balancing professional and family responsibilities whether because they are lower stress or offer greater flexibility. But Budig and England 2001 find little support in the data for this. They find motherhood does not impact mothers pay through the types of jobs women with children choose except when it comes to choosing parttime jobs which does partially account for the motherhood penalty. Instead they find that it is mothers breaks in employment as opposed to the jobs they take that lead to a discrepancy in pay between mothers and women without children. Goldin 2014 argues that women s labor market choices are strongly conditioned by social norms and expectations regarding who bears the burden of domestic work as well as employer indifference toward this burden. The observed patterns of decreased labor supply and earnings substantially reflect women s choices given family constraints and the inflexibility of work schedules in many corporate and finance sector jobs the report explains. Finally the perception that women with children choose to work less is often false. Instead mothers in the workplace are simply judged more harshly in regard to their employer commitment than women without children. Correll Benard and Paik 2011 find that mothers are seen as less committed to the workplace than women without children in comparable jobs. For men it s the opposite fathers are seen as more committed than childless men. Gender differences in salary negotiation explain a portion of the gender gap. Men are more likely to negotiate their salary which increases their earnings Babcock and Laschever 2007. However men and women face different social incentives for negotiation and there is evidence that women are more likely to be penalized when they negotiate Bowles Babcock and Lei 2006. The constraints on negotiation clearly have an impact women who consistently negotiate their salary are paid over 1 million more across their lifetime than women who do not negotiate Babcock and Laschever 2007. Evidence also shows that men benefit disproportionately from incentive pay Albanesi Olivetti and Prados 2015. Female executives receive a lower share of incentive pay relative to their male counterparts and this difference accounts for 93 percent of the gender gap in total pay Albanesi Olivetti and Prados 2015. Performance pay also disproportionately rewards male executives. Researchers found that every 1 million increase in firm value generates a 17150 increase in firmspecific wealth for male executives but only a 1670 increase for their female counterparts Albanesi Olivetti and Prados 2015. This research suggests that women are hurt by incentive pay at the top of the earnings spectrum in two ways 1 women are less likely to be rewarded using incentive pay when they are in highranking managerial positions and 2 they are less likely to reach those commanding heights of the economy where they would receive more of their pay through an incentivebased structure. Only 60 percent of men and 62 percent of women have access to paid sick days Williams and Gault 2014. Although there doesn t appear to be an overall gender gap in paid sick time Hispanic women are less likely than men to have access to paid sick time 49 percent of Latinas lack such a benefit. Two disproportionately female groups lowwage workers and parttime workers are also less likely to have paid sick leave than their higher wage and fulltime counterparts BLS 2015 Figure R. Source Bureau of Labor Statistics National Compensation SurveyEmployee Benefits in the United States July 2016 Table 6 Women are less likely than men to receive health insurance through their own job. In 2015 34 percent of women had employerprovided health insurance compared with 43 percent of men KFF 2016. However men s and women s overall participation rates in employer retirement plans are about the same despite the fact that as of 2012 women were slightly more likely than men to work for employers that offered retirement plans. The equal participation rate is due to a gap in eligibility that limits women s participation Brown et al.. But equal participation does not mean equal retirement security. Because of their care responsibilities women are more likely to move in and out of the workforce. This weakens their earnings power and as a result women have less retirement wealth than men both in traditional pensions and employer savings accounts such as 401ks. In 2010 women s income from definedbenefit employer pensions was about 33 percent less than men s Brown et al.. And an analysis of 3 million participants in money manager Vanguard s fund showed that the median amount accumulated in definedcontribution retirement accounts i.e. 401ks and the like was 34 percent less for women than for men Brown et al.. Women age 65 and older are 80 percent more likely than their male counterparts to be living in poverty Brown et al.. And widowed women are twice as likely as widowed men to be living below the poverty line Brown et al.. This publication was made possible by a grant from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation.

Wages here refers to the hourly wages of all wage and salary workers between 18 and 64 years old. Throughout we use wage gap and pay gap interchangeably to refer to the wage gap. 2. The typical woman or man referred to here and throughout is the median female or male worker. 3. Unless otherwise specified the EPI analyses throughout this piece use data on hourly wages of all workers not just fulltime workers. Technically this is an adjusted gender wage gap measure because the weekly or annual gender wage gap would allow hours of work to differ. An hourly wage gap will not capture the direct effect of differences in hours or weeks worked but it will capture the indirect effect of wage differences due to the effect of hours on hourly wages. This limited adjustment allows us to compare women s and men s wages without assuming that women who still shoulder a disproportionate amount of responsibilities at home would be able or willing to work as many hours as their male counterparts. Examining this raw gap we hope to have a more thorough conversation about the ways a large basket of factors interact and create the wage gap women experience when they cash their paychecks. Of course our answers to questions about the wage gap also draw on the work of other researchers who may use different measures. Claudia Goldin for example uses earnings of fulltime fullyear workers. 4. While there is no fatherhood penalty in the data there is evidence that fathers who take leave are punished as well Bertrand Goldin and Katz 2009. 5. The median is the value you get if you take a set of numbers arrange them from highest to lowest and choose the number that is exactly in the middle. Technically the median hourly wage is an adjusted gender wage gap measure because the weekly or annual gender wage gap would allow hours of work to differ. For details on the methodology used see the Documentation section of the Economic Policy Institute s State of Working America Data Library epi.orgdata. 6. The regressionbased gap is based on average wages and controls for gender race and ethnicity education experience and geographic division. The log of the hourly wage is the dependent variable. 7.
