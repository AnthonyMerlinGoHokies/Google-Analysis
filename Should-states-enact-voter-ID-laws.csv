https://www.ncsl.org/resources/details/state-of-play-voter-id-unpacking-the-debate-as-voters-head-to-the-polls, As the primary season heats up across the country voter ID laws are a point of focus as Americans hit the polls. Thirtyseven states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls while the remaining 13 states and Washington D.C. use other methods to identify voters such as utility bills bank statements or sworn affidavits. In this month s installment of State of Play a bipartisan video series created by A Starting Point and NCSL North Carolina Sen. Warren Daniel R and Maryland Del. Jheanelle Wilkins D delve into the controversial issue. Wilkins who serves as vice chair of the Ways and Means Committee and as a member of the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee says when implementing voting policies it s crucial to think about how they will make the voting process more accessible to more residents.  Voter ID laws are actually a barrier because not everyone has an ID and the people who tend not to have identification tend to be those who are people of color people with disabilities people who are returning citizens and some of our most vulnerable communities who we really want to ensure have full access to participate in the fabric of our society she says. Daniel who serves as the chairman of the Redistricting and Elections Committee and as cochair of the Joint Legislative Elections Oversight Committee says most voters support voter ID laws.  We think it s a good way to enhance voter confidence he says. And in North Carolina we have expansive opportunities to vote. We have one of the longest early voting periods in the country. We have one of the longest absenteemailin voting processes in the country.  Listen in as Wilkins and Daniel discuss how voter ID laws can be written to balance election security with ballot access for all eligible voters whether states should enact mandatory voter ID laws and the question of expanding early voting and voting by mail.

https://www.lwv.org/blog/whats-so-bad-about-voter-id-laws, Voter ID laws have long been debated in the United States. While supporters argue that voter photo ID laws are necessary to prevent voter fraud and ensure the integrity of elections reality tells a different story. Not only do these measures disproportionately impact Black Native elderly and student voters but they also fail to effectively address any real issues related to election integrity the very thing advocates say these measures are designed to do.  In this blog well explore the true nature of voter photo ID laws examine the arguments supporting them and look at how they impact voters at the polls from different walks of life.  Support provoter initiatives in your community by joining one of the 700 state and local Leagues. For many decades politicians across the country have sounded the alarm about the purported risk of voter fraud and pushed for adopting voter photo ID laws to address this perceived threat. On the surface this might seem harmless or even sensible. If we use a governmentissued photo ID to buy alcohol or rent a hotel room what s the harm in asking for a photo ID to cast a ballot? No one wants to have a stranger impersonating them in a voting booth.  The issue with this argument is that time and time again voter photo ID laws are proven to be ineffective tools to fight voter fraud in the rare instances it does take place. While voter photo ID laws aim to prevent inperson voter impersonation an almost nonexistent form of voter fraud other types of voter impersonation are similarly rare and not cause for significant concern. According to the Brennan Center the rate of inperson voter impersonation is extremely low only 0.00004 of all ballots cast. It s worth noting that this rate is even significantly lower than other rare forms of voter fraud such as absentee ballot fraud which voter photo ID laws do not address.  Voter fraud is so extremely rare. Out of 250000000 votes cast by mail in 2020 there were 193 criminal convictions. By those numbers a person is more likely to be struck by lightning than they are to commit voter fraud. Further there are already measures in place to detect irregularities and investigate potential cases of voter fraud making the need for further legislation even smaller.  Not only are voter photo ID laws ineffective as means of combating voter fraud but their main impact is that they promote voter suppression. The use of restrictive voting laws to disenfranchise minority voters can be traced back to the Jim Crow era when many states employed various tactics including literacy tests poll taxes and extralegal measures such as violence and intimidation to prevent Black Americans from voting. Following the enactment of the Voting Rights Act VRA in 1965 many of these tactics were outlawed but efforts to restrict voting access persisted including implementing voter ID laws.  Restrictive voting measures are designed to maintain the power structures that benefit those in control largely white legislators and their legacy is still felt today. In 2013 the Supreme Court handed down a landmark decision in Shelby County v. Holder invalidating Section 5 of the VRA. Section 5 required certain states and jurisdictions with a history of racial discrimination in voting to obtain federal approval or preclearance before making any changes to their voting laws or procedures. The Department of Justice blocked over 700 voting changes they found to be discriminatory from 1982 through the VRA s 2006 reauthorization. Since the Shelby County v. Holder decision many states have enacted new voting restrictions centered around voter photo IDs. For example Texas didn t even sleep on it they moved to introduce a strict voter ID law at midnight after the Supreme Court decision was handed down in 2013. That law resulted in the ineligibility of an estimated 608470 registered voters in Texas representing a total of about 4.5 of registered voters in the state at the time.  The negative impact of strict voter ID laws is not limited to Black Americans other marginalized populations also face disproportionate barriers to voting because of these laws. Native American communities lowincome elderly and rural voters are disproportionately affected by voter photo ID laws. This is partially because photo IDs aren t as common as many people assume 18 of all citizens over the age of 65 16 of Latino voters 25 of Black voters and 15 of lowincome Americans lack acceptable photo ID. Elderly and lowincome voters may not have the availability financial resources or mobility to obtain the necessary identification and rural voters may face significant barriers to obtaining the necessary documentation due to their geographic isolation. Further many rural and Native Americans born at home or on reservations and tribal lands lack the mandated paperwork needed to obtain a governmentissued ID that fits the legal requirements to vote.  Aside from class and racial discrimination there are other peculiar ways voter photo ID laws turn voters away from the polls. For example people who change their last names after marriage or divorce and don t have a permissible ID that reflects their name on the voter rolls may be unable to cast a ballot. College students are also uniquely impacted by these laws as their primary form of ID can often be a student ID which isn t always accepted as a valid form for voting. In all these cases voter ID laws deny eligible voters access to the ballot box.  The League of Women Voters supports free fair and accessible elections for all eligible Americans and we oppose efforts to create barriers that block citizens from fully participating in our democracy. Voting is the one time when all citizens have an equal say in our government. Our country was founded on the principle that we are all created equal. Living up to this promise to provide all citizens with the same freedoms and opportunities means it is wrong to pass laws that deny eligible American voters the opportunity to participate equally in our democracy.  In combination with the ineffectiveness of voter photo ID laws at preventing the rare instances of voter fraud the more likely results of voter photo ID laws are voter suppression and reduced turnout among vulnerable populations.  The principle of voter suppression is fundamentally wrong and goes against the values of democracy. Our goal should always be to increase access for eligible voters not restrict it. For these reasons LWV does not support voter photo ID laws or any other measures that create unequal andor unnecessary burdens to voting.

This afternoon a judge for the Cole County Circuit Court granted a preliminary injunction in our LWV MO and Missouri NAACP v. Missouri lawsuit which blocks enforcement of several provisions in H.B. 1878 that criminalizes voter engagement activity and distribution of absentee ballot applications conducted by civic engagement groups. Individual voter challenges occur when a person s eligibility to vote is questioned. Across the country ithey have been a vehicle for race and languagebased discrimination election confusion and voter suppression. Eligible voters deserve equal access to register and vote under the law.

From the 15th and 19th Amendments to the passage of the Voting Rights Act there have been many long hard battles and many victories in the field of voting rights. But the fight is not over. In many ways it is worse than ever. In 2013 the Supreme Court struck down a major provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder that required states and local governments to get federal approval before changing voting laws. These provisions were in place to stop racially discriminatory laws from being passed at the state level to curtail voting rights. Just two hours after the Supreme Court decision the state of Texas passed the first version of a new voter ID law which allowed citizens to vote with a concealedcarry gun permit but not with a student ID card. As of this writing 34 states have voter ID laws on the books and 20 of those states require governmentissued photo ID with limited or no alternatives. So what s the problem with this? 21 million eligible votersin the United States do not have governmentissued photo ID. And for many these IDs are very difficult to secure. People have fought and died for the right to vote. Voter ID laws prevent people from exercising this right. If you live in a voter ID state there is someone in your district who cannot vote because they don t have the right ID. Lack of access to ID cards impacts people even in states without voter ID laws. Accessing a photo ID is much more challenging for the young the elderly people of color and people with low incomes. All of these groups are more likely not to have photo ID which means they aren t authorized to work and may not have access to their local shelter or food bank. If you care about voter participation and making an impact at the polls in your district getting IDs can not only change the electorate but changes lives. Voter ID laws are laws that say that a voter must show some form of identification to be able to vote. The exact form of ID necessary to vote varies from state to state. In some voter ID states it s as simple as showing proof of residence like a utility bill or W2. In states with strict voter ID laws voters can be required to show a specific form of photo ID from a designated list for example a state driver s license passport etc.. Those who advocate for voter ID laws claim they prevent inperson voter fraud but this is a myth. In person voter fraud is extremely rare. In a 2014 study only 31 cases were found out of more than 1 billion ballots cast in elections from 20002014. And those 31 included any and all credible claims not just prosecutions and convictions. In reality voter ID laws are a powerful form of voter suppression. Millions of voters are prevented from using their voice at the polls because of voter ID laws and voter suppression doesn t hit the whole country equally. Much like poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim Crow days these laws are created to prevent specifically targeted populations from voting. Voter ID laws target eligible voters who are less likely to have IDs. In reality this means these laws suppress the vote from elderly lowincome and voters of color 18 percent or almost 6 million citizens over the age of 65 do not have photo ID 16 percent of Latino voters do not have governmentissued photo ID 25 percent of voting age African Americans 5.5 million people do not have ID and 15 percent of voting age Americans who earn less than 35000 do not have ID. These are some of the people who are prevented from voting by voter ID laws. For many Americans an ID seems like an easy thing to obtain. Everyone has one right? Wrong. Think about it this way. The most common form of ID is a driver s license. A lot of people don t drive. Maybe they live in urban areas are elderly or can t afford driver s ed or a car. For those folks driving is off the table. In some cases people are working schedules that stop them from accessing the venues in which drivers licenses could be obtained. That doesn t mean voting should be off the table. Even other forms of required ID can be hard for many people to come by. Other common forms of required ID include US passports military ID and depending on the state government or private employer IDs tribal IDs student IDs and gun or hunting licenses. In practice this means that if you don t drive don t travel internationally don t have a job that gives you an ID and don t hunt or carry a gun you can t vote in many states. You ll frequently hear the argument that a person has to have an ID to drive a car or buy alcohol so why can t we require ID to vote? Let s be serious driving a car and buying alcohol are not fundamental civil rights. Voting is. Most states that pass voter ID laws create something called a free voter ID. Spoiler alert these IDs are not actually free. In fact they can get very expensive. In most states multiple documents are required to get this free ID just like any other governmentissued photo ID. Required documents can include a birth certificate social security card citizenship papers proof of residency and more. Many many people do not have access to their birth certificates. People experiencing homelessness frequently do not have access to these documents nor do people who ve experienced natural disasters those who move frequently or who just aren t good at tracking paperwork! The problem is even worse for Americans born in Puerto Rico a territory which invalidated all birth certificates issued before 2010 in order to address identity theft issues. Not having a birth certificate is common and getting a replacement can be difficult expensive or both. Even if someone has all of the required documents for a free ID transportation to the DMV or registrar s office can be a challenge. After all if you don t have an ID you don t have a driver s license. Most Americans do not live in cities with robust public transportation options and even public transit can be expensive. People in rural areas have an even more difficult time getting to their DMV which may be miles away. Even more troublingly some states like Alabama paired their new voter ID laws with the closure of DMVs in predominantly Black areas. So in order to vote in states with strict voter ID laws a voter would need to Overcome the very real fear of dealing with a bureaucracy that is traditionally hostile to lowincome Americans and people of color. Voting should not require overcoming so many barriers. We have fought these battles before and won. If we work together we can win them again and make sure every American has not just the right but also the ability to vote. If the fight over voter ID laws seems like bad news it is. But there s good news too we can beat this. If we work together we can help people obtain the IDs they need to vote. When voters come to the polls they ll be able to choose the leaders who best represent their interests. Only then can we get these laws repealed and ensure voting rights for everyone.

Thirtysix states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls. The remaining 14 states and Washington D.C. use other methods to verify the identity of voters. Most frequently other identifying information provided at the polling place such as a signature is checked against information on file. See NCSL s Voter Verification Without ID Documents. Proponents argue increasing identification requirements can prevent inperson voter impersonation and increase public confidence in the election process. Opponents say there is little fraud of this kind and the burden on voters unduly restricts the right to vote and imposes unnecessary costs and administrative burdens on elections administrators. All voters regardless of the type of verification required by the states are subject to perjury charges if they vote under false pretenses. See StatebyState InEffect Voter ID Requirements Table 2 below for citations and details on which IDs are accepted and what happens when a voter does not have ID.

NCSL categorizes voter ID laws in two ways what type of ID is required photo or nonphoto and what actions are available for voters who do not have ID strict or nonstrict. These two categorization schemes can and do overlap. Some states request or require voters to show an identification document that has a photo on it such as a driver s license stateissued identification card military ID tribal ID and many other forms of ID. Other states accept nonphoto identification such as a bank statement with name and address or other document that does not necessarily have a photo. Using this categorization for laws that are in effect as of April 2024 21 states ask for a photo ID and 15 states also accept nonphoto IDs. To see this difference look at the columns in Table 1. If a voter fails to show the ID that is asked for by law states provide alternatives. These laws fit two categories nonstrict and strict. To see this difference look at the rows in Table 1. See StatebyState Details on InEffect Voter ID Requirements Table 2 below for specifics. ArkansasGeorgiaIndianaKansasMississippiMissouriNorth CarolinaOhioTennesseeWisconsin 5 ArizonaNorth Dakota 6Wyoming 3 Alabama 1FloridaIdahoLouisianaMichiganMontanaNebraskaRhode IslandSouth Carolina 4South DakotaTexas AlaskaColoradoConnecticutDelawareIowaKentuckyNew HampshireOklahoma 2UtahVirginiaWashingtonWest Virginia 1 Some might call Alabama s law a strict photo identification law because voters who don t show a photo ID will generally be asked to cast a provisional ballot and then must bring the required ID to an election office by 5 p.m. on Friday after Election Day. However there is an alternative Two election officials can sign sworn statements saying they know the voter. 2 Some prefer to call Oklahoma a photo voter ID state because most voters will show a photo ID before voting. However Oklahoma law also permits a nonphoto voter registration card issued by the appropriate county elections board to serve as proof of identity in lieu of photo ID. 3 Some might call Wyomings law a strict photo ID state because most voters will show a photo ID before voting. However until Dec. 31 2029 Wyoming will accept Medicare and Medicaid identification cards as valid forms of ID for voting neither of which contain a photo.  4 South Carolina has a photo ID requirement but this requirement is waived in select circumstances. See details in Table 2 below. 5 Wisconsin enacted in 2011 a strict photo voter ID law. It has been implemented even as legal challenges have proceeded through the courts. In July 2016 a federal court ruled that the law was unconstitutional and that an alternative to showing an ID such as signing an affidavit attesting to identity must be permitted. Then in August 2016 an appeals court ruled that the law could be implemented as long as the state keeps its pledge to provide temporary free IDs to those in need and to publicize the law. Until the state says otherwise NCSL will leave Wisconsin in the strict photo voter ID category. 6 North Dakota enacted a voter ID law in 2013 and amended this law in 2015 then once again in 2017. The 2015 law was challenged in 2016 and the federal judge issued a temporary order that some sort of failsafe like an affidavit be an option until such time as the court makes an official ruling on the challenge. This temporary order changed North Dakota to a nonstrict state in 2016. In 2017 HB 1369 was enacted allowing voters who do not present an ID at the polls to cast a ballot that is set aside until the voter presents valid identification. This moved North Dakota once again into the strict nonphoto ID category. There are some alternative options for voters without identification in special categories though. See Table 2 below for details. Most states with strict voter identification requirements make some exceptions. These exceptions may include people who The box allows you to conduct a full text search or type the state name.

Michigan A voter who does not possess either of the above may show any of the following as long as they are current An individual who does not possess or did not bring to the polls photo ID may sign an affidavit and vote a regular ballot. Mississippi An individual without ID can cast an affidavit ballot which will be counted if the individual returns to the appropriate circuit clerk within five days after the election and shows governmentissued photo ID. Voters with a religious objection to being photographed may vote an affidavit ballot which will be counted if the voter returns to the appropriate circuit clerk within five days after the election and executes an affidavit that the religious exemption applies. Missouri If the driver or nondriver license has expired after the most recent general election it is an acceptable form of voter ID. If ID is not presented the voter votes on a provisional ballot and must return that day before 7 p.m. to show ID. A provisional ballot is also counted if the signature on a voters provisional ballot envelope is determined by a local election authority to match the signature on the voters registration record. If the identification presented is insufficient to verify the electors identity and eligibility to vote or if the electors name does not appear in the precinct register the elector may sign the precinct register and cast a provisional ballot. Montana uses signature verification to verify the eligibility of provisional ballots. If the voters signature on the provisional ballot affirmation matches the signature on the voters registration record the ballot is counted. 13151072 Nebraska A voter that fails to produce a valid form of identification must fill out a provisional voter identification verification envelope. The voter shall sign the certification under penalty of election falsification. A person s identity may be verified by a moderator or supervisor of the checklist or the town or city clerk but if any person authorized to challenge a voter under RSA 65927 objects to such verification the voter shall be required to execute a challenged voter affidavit. If a voter does not have a valid photo identification the ballot clerk shall inform the voter that he or she may execute a challenged voter affidavit. Unless the voter has a religious objection to having his or her photo taken the moderator will take his or her photo and affix it to the affidavit. The voter may then cast a regular ballot. By Jan. 10 in odd numbered years or within 90 days after any other election the secretary of state is required to mail a nonforwardable letter to each voter who executed a challenged voter affidavit notifying the person that a person who did not present valid photo identification voted using his or her name and address and instruct the person to return the letter within 90 days with a written confirmation that the person voted or to contact the attorney general immediately if he or she did not vote. Any such letters returned as undeliverable must be turned over to the attorney general who shall investigate for voter fraud. Notice from any voter receiving such a letter that she did not vote is also forwarded to the attorney general for investigation. The secretary must also turn over to the attorney general a list of all voters who fail to respond to the letter to confirm that they voted.  Any of the following that is valid and unexpired or has been expired for one year or less  Any of the following regardless of whether the identification contains a printed expiration or issuance date  If a voter cannot produce the required identification the registered voter may cast a provisional ballot that will only be counted if the voter brings an acceptable form of identification to the county board of elections no later than the end of business on the business day prior to the canvass.  North Dakota If an individual s valid form of ID does not include the required information or the information is not current the identification must be supplemented by one of the following that provides the missing or outdated information If an individual is not able to show a valid form of identification but asserts qualifications as an elector in the precinct in which the individual desires to vote the individual may mark a ballot that must be securely set aside in a sealed envelope designed by the secretary of state. After the ballot is set aside the individual may show a valid form of identification to either a polling place election board member if the individual returns to the polling place before the polls close or to an employee of the office of the election official responsible for the administration of the election before the meeting of the canvassing board occurring on the sixth day after the election. Each ballot set aside under this subsection must be presented to the members of the canvassing board for proper inclusion or exclusion from the tally. The following forms of identification are valid for individuals living under special circumstances who do not possess a valid form of identification Ohio For a provisional ballot to be eligible to be counted when cast by an individual who does not have photo identification because the individual has a religious objection to being photographed the individual must complete an affidavit of religious objection. If the individual does not complete the affidavit at the time of casting the provisional ballot the individual must appear at the office of the board of elections within four days after the day of the election and complete the affidavit. For a provisional ballot to be eligible to be counted when cast by any other individual who does not have or is unable to provide photo identification to the election officials the individual who cast that ballot within four days after the day of the election must appear at the office of the board of elections and provide photo identification. Proof of identity shall mean a document that satisfies the following A voter registration card issued by the appropriate county elections board may serve as proof of identity without meeting all of the above requirements. A provisional ballot cast by a voter who declines or is unable to produce proof of identity shall only be considered verified and approved for counting if the voters name residence address date of birth and drivers license number or last four digits of Social Security number as provided on the affidavit match what is in the registration database. Rhode Island A valid unexpired or expired within the last 6 months document showing a photo of the person to whom it was issued including If the person claiming to be a registered and eligible voter is unable to provide proof of identity as required the person shall be allowed to vote a provisional ballot pursuant to section 171924.2. The local board shall determine the validity of the provisional ballot pursuant to section 171924.3. Summary of section 171924.3 The local board shall examine each provisional ballot application to determine if the signature matches the signature on the voters registration. If the signatures match the provisional ballot shall count. If the signatures do not match the ballot shall not count and shall be rejected as illegal. South Carolina Voters who have a reasonable impediment to obtaining photo ID may show a nonphoto voter registration card in lieu of photo ID sign an affidavit attesting to the impediment and cast a provisional ballot. From the State Election Commissions web site If you have a reasonable impediment to obtaining photo ID you may vote a provisional ballot after showing your nonphoto voter registration card. A reasonable impediment is any valid reason beyond your control which created an obstacle to obtaining photo ID. Some examples include If you do NOT have photo ID and do NOT have a reasonable impediment to obtaining one or you simply forgot to bring it with you to the polls you may still vote a provisional ballot. However for your vote to be counted you must provide one of the photo IDs to the county election commission prior to certification of the election usually Thursday or Friday after the election. South Dakota If a voter is not able to present a form of personal identification as required the voter may complete an affidavit in lieu of the personal identification. The affidavit shall require the voter to provide his or her name and address. The voter shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury. Tennessee If a voter is unable to present the proper evidence of identification then the voter will be entitled to vote by provisional ballot in the manner detailed in the bill. The provisional ballot will only be counted if the voter provides the proper evidence of identification to the administrator of elections or the administrators designee by the close of business on the second business day after the election. However A voter who is indigent and unable to obtain proof of identification without payment of a fee or who has a religious objection to being photographed shall be required to execute an affidavit of identity on a form provided by the county election commission and then shall be allowed to vote. 27112f Texas With the exception of the U.S. citizenship certificate the identification must be current or have expired no more than four years before being presented for voter qualification at the polling place. Voters who do not possess an acceptable form of photo ID and cannot obtain one of the forms of acceptable photo ID listed due to a reasonable impediment may present a supporting form of ID and execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration noting the voter s reasonable impediment to obtaining an acceptable form of ID. Supporting forms of ID that can be presented if the voter does not possess one of the forms of acceptable photo ID and cannot obtain one due to a reasonable impediment After presenting a supporting form of ID the voter must execute a Reasonable Impediment Declaration. If a voter possesses an acceptable form of photo ID but does not have it at the polling place the voter will still be permitted to vote provisionally. The voter will have six 6 days to present an acceptable form of photo identification to the county voter registrar or the voter s ballot will be rejected. Voters with a disability who do not have an acceptable form of photo ID may also apply with the county voter registrar for a permanent exemption. Voters who have a consistent religious objection to being photographed and voters who do not present any form of acceptable photo identification as a result of certain natural disasters as declared by the President of the United States or the Texas Governor may vote a provisional ballot appear at the voter registrar s office within six 6 calendar days after election day and sign an affidavit swearing to the religious objection or natural disaster in order for your ballot to be counted. The voter may cast a provisional ballot as provided by 20A3105.5  20A4107 states that a county clerk may verify the identity and residence of a voter who fails to provide valid voter identification through some other means. Virginia Except for first time voters covered by HAVA any voter who does not show one of the forms of ID specified shall be allowed to vote a regular ballot after signing a statement under penalty of perjury verifying their identity. A voter who does not show ID or sign a statement shall be offered a provisional ballot.  29A.40.1607NOTE Most Washington voters now vote by mail. However county auditors are required to open at least one vote center where voters can cast a ballot in person and the ID requirement spelled out here applies to those voters. The county auditor shall require any person desiring to vote at a voting center to either sign a ballot declaration generally in locations where ballots are scanned or provide identification generally in counties where voting is done electronically although even in these counties the auditor can verify a voters signature to a signature on record.  If identification is used it must be valid photo identification such as Any individual who desires to vote in person but cannot provide identification shall be issued a provisional ballot which shall be accepted if the signature on the declaration matches the signature on the voters registration record. West Virginia If the person desiring to vote is unable to furnish a valid identifying document or if the poll clerk determines that the proof of identification presented by the voter does not qualify as a valid identifying document the person desiring to vote shall be permitted to cast a provisional ballot after executing an affidavit affirming his or her identity. The provisional ballot is entitled to be counted once the election authority verifies the identity of the individual by comparing that individual s signature to the current signature on file with the election authority and determines that the individual was otherwise eligible to cast a ballot at the polling place where the ballot was cast. All of the above must include a photo and a name that conforms to the poll list. If the ID presented is not proof of residence the elector shall also present proof of residence. An elector who appears to vote at a polling place and does not have statutory ID shall be offered the opportunity to vote a provisional ballot. An elector who votes a provisional ballot may furnish statutory ID to the election inspectors before the polls close or to the municipal clerk no later than 4 p.m. on the Friday following Election Day. An elector who appears to vote at a polling place and does not have statutory ID shall be offered the opportunity to cast a provisional ballot.  An elector who votes a provisional ballot must furnish statutory ID to the county clerk by the close of business on the day following the election. In addition to the laws governing what identification all voters must show at the polls first time voters may face additional requirements. The federal Help America Vote Act section 15483b2A mandates that all states require identification from firsttime voters who register to vote by mail and have not provided verification of their identification at the time of registration. The act lists a current and valid photo identification or a copy of a current utility bill bank statement government check paycheck or other government document that shows the name and address of the voter as acceptable forms of ID.

https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/voter-identification, Supporters of more stringent voter ID requirements argue that these will deter voter fraud and instill confidence in the integrity of the electoral process. Opponents argue that voter fraud is extremely rare so the only effect of strict ID requirements is to raise the barriers to voting in ways that disproportionately affect citizens of low socioeconomic status. The recent increase in strict voter ID requirements has led to several lawsuits alleging racial discrimination. Similarly the rise of voter ID laws has led to an increase in scholarly research into the effects of these laws on voter turnout. Under the 2002 Help America Vote Act HAVA all firsttime voters in federal elections in every state must show some form of ID at the polls if they registered by mail. They do not need to show ID if they registered in person. States are allowed to augment identification requirements beyond this HAVA minimum for all voters firsttime or not. States with HAVAminimum requirements typically require voters to announce their name and address at a checkin table when they vote in person. Many of these states also require the voter to sign in. Falsely claiming to be a registered voter is voter impersonation fraud and is a felony in most states. The National Conference of State Legislatures NCSL has created a useful twodimensional classification system to describe the types of voter identification requirements for states that go beyond the HAVA minimum. The first dimension is whether the state requires the voter to show an ID with a photograph. The second dimension is whether a voter without proper ID is required to cast a provisional ballot and then take some additional steps after Election Day to have the ballot counted strict states or whether such a voter can sign an affidavit attesting to his or her identity and cast a regular ballot on Election Day nonstrict states. The following map summarizes voter ID laws as of the summer of 2020. As a general matter the strictest ID laws are in the South and Great Lakes states the least strict laws are in the Northeast and the West Coast.  var divElement document.getElementByIdviz1623269013502 var vizElement divElement.getElementsByTagNameobject0 vizElement.style.width800pxvizElement.style.height627px var scriptElement document.createElementscript scriptElement.src httpspublic.tableau.comjavascriptsapiviz_v1.js vizElement.parentNode.insertBeforescriptElement vizElement State voter ID laws are very detailed so this article only summarizes voter ID policy. If you are interested in the details of voter ID laws in your state consult your state or local election officials. The U.S. Vote Foundation has a lookup tool with useful statespecific election information. Voter ID laws in general only apply to those who vote in person. The exception is firsttime voters who registered by mail. Under HAVA these voters must include a photocopy of their identification if they vote for the first time by mail. The identification of voters who cast their ballots by mail whether a traditional absentee or votebymail ballot is typically handled by matching the signature on the outer return envelope with the signature election officials have on file. Prior to the 2000 election voter ID laws were not very controversial. Most states had what are now known as HAVAminimum requirements although some had nonstrict nonphoto ID laws. Photo ID requirements were given a boost by two efforts that followed the 2000 presidential election controversy. First ID provisions pertaining to firsttime voters were a concession made by Democratic sponsors of HAVA to Republicans to get the law passed in the Senate. Second in its 2005 report the Commission on Federal Election Reform the CarterBaker Commission recommended that all states institute photo ID requirements.  The first state to pass a strict voter photo ID requirement was Indiana in 2005. The law was immediately challenged by the Marion County Indianapolis Democratic Central Committee as imposing an undue burden on voting rights under the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Both the federal trial court and the circuit court of appeals rejected these claims. The U.S. Supreme Court granted a writ of certiorari in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board the justices ruled that states had a reasonable interest in preventing election fraud and that photo ID laws were not on their face unconstitutional. In upholding the Indiana law however the court opened up the possibility that the particular facts surrounding other states ID laws could be used to strike them down. The 2008 Crawford decision was seen as a green light both to supporters and opponents of stricter ID laws. To supporters Crawford signaled that reasonable ID requirements motivated by a desire to prevent voter fraud would likely be found constitutional. To opponents the Crawford decision laid out a possible path to future challenges. While the Supreme Court ruled that photo ID laws were not unconstitutional on their face it did signal that if opponents could show specific harms to voters that outweighed states interests in curbing fraud strict voter ID laws might be struck down. The number of states that had some type of voter ID requirement rose significantly between the presidential elections of 2004 and 2008 see Figure 2. The fastestgrowing categories of ID laws involved photo identification although most states with photo ID requirements still fall into the nonstrict category.  var divElement document.getElementByIdviz1623269031250 var vizElement divElement.getElementsByTagNameobject0 vizElement.style.width650pxvizElement.style.height527px var scriptElement document.createElementscript scriptElement.src httpspublic.tableau.comjavascriptsapiviz_v1.js vizElement.parentNode.insertBeforescriptElement vizElement A second spur to the passage of formal ID laws especially strict photo ID laws was the Supreme Court s decision in Shelby County v. Holder. This 2013 case related to the federal preclearance provisions of the Voting Rights Act VRA. Prior to Shelby County states covered under Section 5 of the VRA primarily states that seceded during the Civil War were required to have any electionrelated voting procedure changes precleared by the Justice Department. To be granted preclearance a state covered by Section 5 would have to show that an ID law did not make minority voters worse off in their effective exercise of the electoral franchise. Although Section 5 did not altogether stop the passage of stricter photo ID requirements Georgia s strict photo ID law was precleared by the Department of Justice in 2006 it put a damper on states that might have otherwise attempted to pass them. With preclearance effectively gutted due to the court s decision that the coverage formula outlined in Section 4 of the VRA was outdated southern states were emboldened to adopt stricter ID laws. Several states including North Carolina and Texas moved quickly to enact photo ID laws that were much stricter than those from the previous decade.  Even more changes to voter identification law and election administration resulted from the 2020 presidential election in which many Americans opted to vote by mail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The election spurred an expansion of vote by mail eligibility throughout the country but also led some members of the Republican party and their constituents to doubt the veracity of the election and worry that voter fraud was rampant because of absentee ballots.  As a consequence of this new skepticism about the security of absentee ballots several Republicancontrolled legislatures have increased identification requirements for mail ballotsin many cases adding them when they had previously been nonexistent. Examples of laws passed early in 2021 were those enacted in Georgia SB 202 Florida SB 90 and Montana SB 169. Rather than require a copy of one s photo ID per se these bills require those returning mail ballots supply their driver s license number or the last four digits of their Social Security number. Voter ID has been the subject of intense scrutiny from the scholarly community. One topic of great interest has been the disparate impact photo ID laws have had on racial minority groups and turnout.  Research associated with litigation in which voter rolls have been matched against driver s license lists has confirmed this finding in states such as North Carolina Pennsylvania South Carolina Texas and Wisconsin. Whether these differences have been sufficient to invalidate the laws has varied across courts. Whether the lack of IDs leads to a decrease in turnout is still open to dispute. Some early studies by Ansolabehere and Mycoff et al found no statistical association between strict ID laws and decreased turnout. A more recent study by the GAO has shown a negative correlation between strict photo ID laws and turnout. This finding has been supported by other research here and here. However there are methodological challenges to estimating the true causal effects of strict voter identification law including deficiencies in data quality and sensitivity of results to choices made in statistical estimation here and here. While it may seem obvious that voter ID laws serve to depress turnout even if descriptively and not causally scholars have made important arguments that the very presence of voter ID laws can have a countermobilizing effect that encourages greater turnout among voting populations that are targeted by those laws. Another important research issue is whether ID laws are implemented consistently as written. Based on studies involving close observation of poll workers at least two articles here and here suggest that inconsistent implementation may be common. Another aspect of voter ID laws is the effect of these laws on the confidence of voters. Research into this question was partially inspired by the argument of the Supreme Court in Marion County that a rational justification for a state passing a strict ID law is to instill greater confidence in the electoral process. However the research conducted on this question see here and here has not found a consistent correlation between the presence of strict ID laws in a state and an increase in voter confidence or a decrease in the belief that fraud is rampant. Scholars have also studied factors that lead states to adopt strict ID requirements. Strict ID laws are fairly popular among all elements of the mass public including Democrats minority groups and liberals. Still Republicans conservatives and whites are more likely to approve of these laws. What prompts a state legislature to adopt a strict photo ID law appears to be a confluence of three factors While these factors are not present in all states that have adopted strict photo ID laws they are common to most.

https://news.nd.edu/news/voter-id-laws-mobilize-voters-in-both-parties-rather-than-sway-election-results/,  Skip To Content Skip To Navigation Skip To Search University of Notre Dame Notre Dame News  Published February 06 2023   Author Tracy DeStazio  Jeffrey Harden Political Science and Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics In the past two decades many state governments have enacted voter identification requirements for constituents voting in their state requiring a photo ID or other significant proof to access a ballot. These laws were intended to prevent voter fraud and increase election security but they also sparked national debate over whether they disenfranchised disadvantaged groups such as people living in poverty or people of color who may not have a valid ID nor be able to obtain one.  Many argued that implementing the ID requirements gave Republicans the electoral advantage while harming Democrats whose supporters were more likely to be affected by the laws. Up until now the extent to which these laws provided electoral benefits for Republican candidates andor disadvantages for Democratic ones had not been considered.  In a study recently published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Jeffrey Harden the Andrew J. McKenna Family Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science and concurrent associate professor in the Department of Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics and Alejandra Campos a thirdyear graduate student in the political science doctorate program both at the University of Notre Dame found that voter ID requirements motivated supporters of both parties equally to comply and participate but had little overall effect on the actual outcomes of the elections.  We addressed a very simple question of whether or not these laws actually have the sort of electoral effects that people seem to think they do Harden said. It was surprising to us to see that no one had really addressed that question yet.  The two researchers examined the effect of voter ID laws on the electoral results for significant political races at the state level state legislatures and governorships and federal level U.S. Congress and president from 2003 to 2020. The framework of the study was to find out whether a voter ID requirement affected the vote share advantage of Republican or Democratic candidates in these races. The assumption Harden explained is that because Democratic voters tend to be the ones who are more impacted by voter ID requirements it is in the Democratic Party s interest to push back against these laws and in the Republican Party s interest to advocate for them.   This suggests that one party s candidates would benefit more and one party s candidates would be penalized more by these laws Harden theorized. But that s not really what s going on here the longterm implications of voter ID are more nuanced than that.  Rather the researchers speculated voter ID laws had a countermobilization effect by creating a complex series of events happening over the course of the campaign that resulted in supporters of both parties getting motivated and mobilized which ultimately diminished the laws anticipated effects on the actual election results.  The parties had to take additional steps to counteract these laws Campos explained. The Democratic Party for example mobilized their constituents to meet the ID requirements so the laws would not impact their electoral fortunes.  Other implications include the idea that ID requirements frustrated Democrats and enthused Republicans motivating both groups supporters to vote. In addition the researchers wrote voters may have become accustomed to adhering to the laws thus softening their controversial stigma in the public s opinion and eventually reducing their effects.  Any impact these laws exert on voter access occurs concurrently with their effects on other elements of the electoral process the researchers pointed out. What we find out in the end is that the results get washed out to the point where these voter ID laws don t have much of an impact on the actual electoral outcomes.  With existing research pointing to the fact that voter ID laws don t necessarily impact voter fraud or voter turnout and Harden s and Campos research indicating that they don t have much of an effect on election results Harden suggested we ask ourselves How difficult should it be in a democratic society for a person to vote?   What we re talking about here are reforms that make a fundamentally democratic practice i.e. voting more or less difficult for people. Being at a university committed to truth and the common good we need to understand if this significant reform is doing what people expect it to when they enact that reform.   We think this should be a part of the discussion both researchers said. Future election policy may benefit from a shift in the debate. Instead of focusing on which is more important voting security or access lawmakers should consider what is the minimum amount of voter responsibility required to vote the researchers said rather than setting up barriers to voting not supported by evidence.  We need to ask ourselves Why are we doing this? Campos noted. We need to think seriously about the consequences of these laws and whether or not there s any benefit to them at all.  Harden noted the importance of studying democratic institutions and the way in which democracy can ebb and flow within a country and how this practice fits in ideally with the mission of Notre Dame.   What we re talking about here are reforms that make a fundamentally democratic practice i.e. voting more or less difficult for people Harden said. Being at a university committed to truth and the common good we need to understand if this significant reform is doing what people expect it to when they enact that reform.

Whether states should require voters to show identification before voting is a subject of debate.  As of April 2024 35 states required voters to present identification in order to vote at the polls on Election Day. Of these states 24 required voters to present identification containing a photograph and 11 accepted other forms of identification. The remaining 16 states did not require voters to present identification in order to vote at the polls on Election Day.  Valid forms of identification differ by state. In certain states that require voters to provide identification there may be exceptions that allow some voters to cast a ballot without providing an ID. To see more about these exceptions see details by state below. Commonly accepted forms of ID include drivers licenses stateissued identification cards and military identification cards. 1 2  This section includes quotes briefly summarizing some of the most prevalent arguments for and against voter identification laws. Three arguments in favor of requiring voter identification are that it is needed to prevent voter fraud it does not decrease voter turnout and it is popular with voters. This section includes quotations detailing those arguments from a variety of sources. The Repair the Vote PAC filed a measure with the Nevada Secretary of State on December 7 2023 requesting to add the Nevada Voter Identification Amendment to the ballot in 2024. The measure would amend the states constitution to require photo identification in order to vote. 5  According to its website the Repair the Vote PAC says it is a group of Nevada citizens whose mission is to repair the voting process in Nevada. 5  Every citizen needs faith that the election process is fair and accurate. A big part of that is to verify the identity of every voter just as companies verify the identity of the person getting on an aircraft checking in at a hotel or cashing a check at a bank. When voters lose faith in the process that drives elections they also lose faith in the outcome and in the legitimacy of those declared the winners. 6  In a 2019 article for The Heritage Foundation called New Study Confirms Voter ID Laws Don t Hurt Election Turnout Hans Von Spakovsky and Caleb Morrison disputed the idea that voter identification laws reduce turnout among minority voters citing the results of a recent study by the National Bureau of Economic Research as evidence. Less than one week after Georgia Democrat Stacey Abrams made inflammatory claims in her State of the Union response about an epidemic of voter suppression jeopardizing the character of our nation the National Bureau of Economic Research released a study that demonstrates once again that voter ID laws have no measurable impact on voting behavior. In other words voter ID laws don t suppress anyone s vote.  This latest study echoes the conclusion of others including a landmark report by The Heritage Foundation in 2007 finding that voter ID laws don t reduce voter turnout including among AfricanAmericans and Hispanics. These voters were just as likely to vote in states requiring photo identification as in those that don t.  Researchers for the National Bureau of Economic Research found that between 2008 and 2016 voter ID laws had no negative effect on registration or turnout overall or for any specific group defined by race gender age or party affiliation. 6  In 2021 Spectrum News digital media producer Ryan Chatelain wrote an article analyzing the debate over voter identification laws and discussed public opinion on the topic. While photo voter ID laws might seem like a partisan issue polls have found otherwise. In one of the latest surveys on the topic Monmouth University found that 80 of Americans support requiring voters to show photo identification at polling sites while just 18 oppose it.  While support for such requirements was higher among Republicans 91 62 of Democrats and 87 of independents also were in favor of them. Eightyfour percent of minorities also support photo ID laws according to the poll. 6  Three arguments against requiring voter identification are that they are burdensome for many voters and target minorities. Opponents of requiring voter identification also argue that inperson voter fraud is rare. This section includes quotations detailing those arguments from a variety of sources. In a 2017 Fact sheet on voter ID laws the American Civil Liberties Union ACLU outlined the following claims On its website the group Indivisible called Voter ID 101 The Right to Vote Shouldnt Come With Barriers argued that voter ID laws are deliberately crafted to target minority voters. Indivisibles website says it is a progressive organization dedicated to resisting the Trump agenda. 9  In 2013 the Supreme Court struck down a major provision of the Voting Rights Act in Shelby County v. Holder that required states and local governments to get federal approval before changing voting laws. These provisions were in place to stop racially discriminatory laws from being passed at the state level to curtail voting rights. Just two hours after the Supreme Court decision the state of Texas passed the first version of a new voter ID law which allowed citizens to vote with a concealedcarry gun permit but not with a student ID card. As of this writing 34 states have voter ID laws on the books and 20 of those states require governmentissued photo ID with limited or no alternatives... Voter ID laws are a powerful form of voter suppression. Millions of voters are prevented from using their voice at the polls because of voter ID laws and voter suppression doesn t hit the whole country equally. Much like poll taxes and literacy tests of the Jim Crow days these laws are created to prevent specifically targeted populations from voting. Voter ID laws target eligible voters who are less likely to have IDs. In reality this means these laws suppress the vote from elderly lowincome and voters of color. 6  In a blog post for the League of Women Voters Brady Horine the organizations legislative and policy coordinator argued that inperson voter fraud is rare in the United States. According to its website the League of Women Voters says it is a political grassroots network and membership organization working to empower voters and defend democracy. 11  ...time and time again voter photo ID laws are proven to be ineffective tools to fight voter fraud in the rare instances it does take place. While voter photo ID laws aim to prevent inperson voter impersonation an almost nonexistent form of voter fraud other types of voter impersonation are similarly rare and not cause for significant concern. According to the Brennan Center the rate of inperson voter impersonation is extremely low only 0.00004 of all ballots cast. It s worth noting that this rate is even significantly lower than other rare forms of voter fraud such as absentee ballot fraud which voter photo ID laws do not address.  Voter fraud is so extremely rare. Out of 250000000 votes cast by mail in 2020 there were 193 criminal convictions. By those numbers a person is more likely to be struck by lightning than they are to commit voter fraud. Further there are already measures in place to detect irregularities and investigate potential cases of voter fraud making the need for further legislation even smaller. 6  ifdocument.getElementsByClassNamereference.length0 ifdocument.getElementByIdFootnotes!null document.getElementByIdFootnotes.parentNode.style.display none Communications Alison Graves Carley Allensworth Abigail Campbell Sarah Groat Erica ShumakerExternal Relations Andrew Heath Moira Delaney Hannah NelsonOperations Meghann Olshefski Amanda Herbert Mandy Morris Caroline Presnell Kelly RindfleischPolicy Caitlin Styrsky Molly Byrne Jon Dunn Jimmy McAllister Annelise ReinwaldResearch Josh Altic Tech Matt Latourelle Ryan Burch Kirsten Corrao Beth Dellea Travis Eden Tate Kamish Margaret Kearney Eric Lotto Trevor Pollo Joseph Sanchez Ballotpedia features 477486 encyclopedic articles written and curated by our professional staff of editors writers and researchers.

And with Republicanled state legislatures passing new voting restrictions and congressional Democrats seeking to block them the debate isn t going away any time soon. It s a rather complex topic one in which there is various research available that supports the arguments of both proponents and opponents. Due to the nuances of individual state laws courts have come out on both sides of the issue. And sometimes voters might form an opinion without seeing the full picture such as the factors that might make it challenging for some Americans to obtain an approved photo ID. According to Ballotpedia 21 states have photo voter ID laws. Several have strict photo ID laws ones that require voters who do not show an approved form of identification to cast a provisional ballot and take additional steps before their vote is counted. Meanwhile some state lawmakers are continuing to push for new or tougher photo ID laws including in Missouri and Michigan. Here is a look at the ongoing debate over voter photo ID laws Those who support strict ID requirements say they only want to protect elections from fraud and ensure confidence in the democratic process.  We have ID laws in almost every other aspect of everyday life said Hans von Spakovsky manager of the Election Law Reform Initiative at the Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank. It s just part of the basic security that you need for an election system which is to make sure voters verify that they really are the person whos registered. It s one way of preventing the legitimate votes of eligible citizens from from being diluted by fraud.  But critics argue that photo ID laws are an unnecessary solution to a nonexistent problem. And there are many studies that agree. In 2014 Justin Levitt a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles wrote in The Washington Post that a study he conducted found only 31 credible allegations of voter impersonation from 2000 to 2014 out of more than 1 million ballots cast. Researchers at Arizona State University reached a similar conclusion. New York University s Brennan Center for Justice found that the incidences of voter impersonation are so rare that an American is more likely to be struck by lightning than try to pass themselves off as someone else at the polls. Additionally former President Donald Trump and his allies failed to prove his claims of widespread voter fraud in the presidential election to judges prosecutors and elections officials.   The very specific type of fraud that a voter ID law is mentioned to be getting at which is someone showing up to vote and pretending to be someone that theyre not that is incredibly vanishingly rare said Sean MoralesDoyle deputy director of voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center.   The fact that we dont have a problem with rampant voter fraud isnt an accident MoralesDoyle added. Its not just coincidence. Its not that we havent had laws on the books and people are just honest and maybe thatll all change tomorrow when people figure out that they could be committing fraud. The fact is that voter fraud is already illegal and if you engage in these kinds of things were talking about it is really hard to get away with.  But von Spakovsky an exJustice Department lawyer and former member of the Federal Election Commission insists that fraud does occur.  The left constantly says Well it only prevents impersonation fraud. Thats wrong he said. It also can potentially prevent individuals or nonU.S. citizens from voting. It could also potentially prevent individuals who dont actually live in the state from voting.  Besides von Spakovsky says if you re not asking for identification how can you be certain there is no impersonation?  Critics say strict voter ID laws disproportionately disenfranchise groups of voters who are less likely to have the sort of identification that is required. A Brennan Center for Justice survey in 2006 for instance found that 11 of U.S. citizens including a quarter of African Americans of legal voting age did not own a governmentissued photo identification.  That number might seem surprising to Americans who have carried a driver s license around in their wallets their entire adult lives. But voting rights advocates say there are a number of valid reasons someone might lack an ID card such as They don t drive because they are elderly or live in an urban area where they rely on public transportation. They don t have the money or means of transportation to obtain an ID or the underlying paperwork required for one. They find it daunting if not impossible to obtain those underlying documents because for example they might have been born outside the hospital system with the assistance of a midwife and never had a birth certificate. A popular argument among the proID crowd including von Spakovsky is that photo identification is needed for many other aspects of life including cashing a check boarding an airplane or purchasing alcohol so it should also be required to ensure the integrity of elections. But photo ID opponents are quick to say that those activities aren t fundamental constitutional rights and that in many cases people might have a form of ID that allows them to navigate everyday life but that still falls short of meeting strict voting requirements.   That is really demonstrative of how these laws are written to impact certain people certain voices certain voters said Molly McGrath a voting rights campaign strategist for the American Civil Liberties Union.  In fact McGrath said she believes the voterfraud justification for ID laws is a pretext. She s far from alone. It s an argument that has been at the center of the vast majority of court challenges of ID laws that the true objective of Republicans is to suppress the votes of certain groups of people including minorities and the lowincome who are more likely to vote Democrat.   We all as Americans value our right to vote we want our elections to be safe and accessible and voter ID isnt the vehicle to get there McGrath said. Instead its a vehicle to silence certain voices.  McGrath and MoralesDoyle also argue that it s clear some laws intentionally aimed to discriminate such as a 2011 law passed in Texas allowing gun licenses as a form of identification but not student IDs or a 2016 law passed in North Dakota requiring that IDs include street addresses something many Native American reservations don t have. The state and tribes reached a settlement in 2020 to ensure Native American voters can cast ballots. Von Spakovsky said that the plaintiffs in some unsuccessful court challenges including in Georgia in 2007 and the U.S. Supreme Court s ruling on Indiana s law in 2008 failed to produce convincing evidence that anyone could not acquire the necessary identification which sometimes is offered for free.  Thats a claim thats been made on numerous occasions von Spakovsky said. And the groups that have said that have been unable to show any evidence thats actually true.  There are conflicting studies on whether strict voter ID laws significantly impact the outcome of an election.  A study commissioned by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that voter ID laws had no clear effect on fraud voter registration or voter turnout.   Overall our findings suggest that efforts to improve elections may be better directed at other reforms says the study published in May in The Quarterly Journal of Economics. The researchers reached their conclusion by analyzing data from 200818 comparing changes in states that had enacted strict voter ID laws to those that had not.  Vincent Pons an associate professor at Harvard University and one of the study s coauthors said they also examined whether efforts to overcome ID laws through increased outreach might have offset the impact of the laws but they found there was only a negligible difference.  The increase in campaign contact could have compensated for small effects of the laws on participation but not massive effects Pons said.  As for the study s conclusions about fraud von Spakovsky says the Heritage Foundation s database one of two used for the analysis is a representative sampling of election fraud cases not an exhaustive and comprehensive list.  He also argues that no study can measure the impact of ID laws as a deterrent to fraud. On the flipside however a 2014 Government Accountability Office report concluded that strict photo ID laws reduced turnout by 2 to 3 percentage points. And a University of Wisconsin survey following the 2016 presidential election found that 11.2 of eligible nonvoting registrants said they were deterred by Wisconsin s voter ID law. The court rulings regarding photo ID laws have been mixed as well.  Proponents of such laws scored a precedentsetting victory when the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Indiana s legislation in Crawford v. Marion County Election Board in 2008 a decision that spurred several other states to enact similar laws. But photo ID critics have scored their share of victories in the courts too mainly when they ve proven that laws were discriminatory or too burdensome. A couple of notable successful court challenges in recent years include a federal judge ruling in North Carolina in 2017 that its law targeted AfricanAmericans with almost surgical precision and another judge ruling the same year that Texas ID law intentionally discriminated against Latino and Black voters. But ultimately the lawsuits at best only weaken not crush the laws as legislators go back to the drawing board and craft a new bill that passes muster in the courts.  While photo voter ID laws might seem like a partisan issue polls have found otherwise.  In one of the latest surveys on the topic Monmouth University found that 80 of Americans support requiring voters to show photo identification at polling sites while just 18 oppose it.  While support for such requirements was higher among Republicans 91 62 of Democrats and 87 of independents also were in favor of them. Eightyfour percent of minorities also support photo ID laws according to the poll. Von Spakovsky said the polling shows that Democrats are not talking to their constituents about ID laws. He also theorized that Democrats like to use the issue to help in fundraising and that some might even like the idea of it being easier to cheat in elections. Last month Stacey Abrams a Democrat who ran for governor in Georgia in 2018 and a prominent voting rights activist surprised some when she endorsed West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin s proposed election bill compromise that would have required voters proving their identity. Senate Republicans later blocked the legislation. Abrams told CNN that Democrats resistance to voter ID was one of the fallacies of Republican talking points and that no one has ever objected to having to prove who you are to vote. Abrams however said she rejected restrictive voter identification designed to keep people out of the process.  Manchin s proposal would have allowed voters to use a utility bill and other forms of alternative identification hardly the sort of strict requirements Democrats have railed against.
