Universal healthcare is a system that provides health insurance to all regardless of their ability to pay. It helps ensure that a country s residents can access the medical care they need no matter their financial situation.  Let s take a deeper look at universal healthcare. We ll cover the different types of universal healthcare its pros and cons countries that have adopted it and more. Universal healthcare seeks to make accessing healthcare a fundamental right for citizens of a country. Under universal healthcare everyone can expect to receive the healthcare they need without financial difficulty.  Universal healthcare is said to date back to 19th century Germany where a system was set up that required industrial employers to provide healthcare to workers. To do so employees and employers contributed to sickness funds which they used to pay for care.  Today universal healthcare systems exist worldwide including Australia Canada Japan and the United Kingdom.  There are pros and cons to each universal healthcare system. Perhaps that s why we see such varied systems across the dozens of countries that offer universal healthcare today. Let s review the pros and cons of universal healthcare.  Maybe the greatest benefit of universal healthcare is that it gives each citizen the ability to access healthcare services regardless of their ability to pay. The World Health Organization argues that healthcare is a fundamental right and that providing citizens with access to healthcare is one of the most important roles of a government. Lower costs for both citizens and healthcare providers Under a universal healthcare system there s no competition among health insurance companies. Instead a single governing entity regulates healthcare costs. This can drive the cost of healthcare down substantially. Similarly it reduces administrative costs for doctors and healthcare practitioners.  A universal healthcare system could save over 450 billion per year according to a 2022 Yale study. This could help many since polls have found that nearly 4 out of 10 Americans have delayed or gone without healthcare because of costs.  Removing barriers for citizens to grow their careers Some workers in today s job market may receive an offer for a higher paying job that would advance their career yet turn it down because the health insurance is not as good.  Universal healthcare could remove this barrier allowing citizens to grow their skills unencumbered by worries about their healthcare costs.  An overall healthier population A universal healthcare system has more incentive than a privatized system to direct spending toward preventive measures.  For example spending on intervention programs in elementary schools for appropriate diet and exercise may effectively reduce heart problems later in life and associated doctor visits.  From an individualistic perspective the greatest argument against universal healthcare might be that each individual would likely lose a degree of choice. Under privatized care individuals can choose their health insurance from different plans that fit their needs. In a universal system some may want additional coverage.  Possible lowerquality care If healthcare providers receive inadequate reimbursement for their costs they may sacrifice the quality of care or narrow their service offerings.  Longer wait times In addition to possibly creating longer wait times for healthcare universal healthcare could restrict access to certain services like elective procedures.  A lack of competition can reduce innovation Where there s competition organizations must search for less expensive or better ways to do things to win customers. Without competition there may be a lack of innovation to provide new services among providers.  Although some may associate universal healthcare with a singlepayer system universal healthcare can come in several forms. These include the Beveridge National Health Insurance and Bismarck models. Let s review the different ways that governments provide universal healthcare worldwide. The Beveridge model refers to a healthcare system that is entirely funded by the government via income taxes. Under this model a majority of health staff gets paid and managed by the government.  Under The Beveridge model every citizen has a right to healthcare and can receive services with no outofpocket costs.  Under this model every citizen pays into a publicly run health insurance program typically through income taxes and the government uses these funds to pay for healthcare hence the name singlepayer.  Unlike the Beveridge model a singlepayer system uses privatesector healthcare providers. This mix of privatized and socialized healthcare typically keeps healthcare costs low and allows patients to choose their provider.  Under this system employees and employers pay into an insurance system that behaves as a sickness fund. Some countries use a singlepayer model with only one insurer while others have multiple competing insurers. The government then tightly regulates prices so insurers do not make a profit.  Unlike many developed countries the United States doesn t offer universal healthcare. Instead the U.S. offers a combination of private insurance and governmentrun healthcare. About twothirds of U.S. citizens use private insurance while the remaining onethird access governmentrun healthcare.  The Affordable Care Act is the United States attempt to make affordable care available to more of its citizens. Although it s not universal healthcare the Affordable Care Act requires all citizens to have health insurance and offers lowincome citizens access to subsidized healthcare through Medicaid a joint federal and state program. Although the U.S. doesn t have universal healthcare there are still ways you can try to reduce your costs for example  If you have medical debt check to see if debt consolidation loans can save you money.
https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/u-s-need-universal-health-care/, Wharton s Robert Hughes speaks with Wharton Business Daily on SiriusXM about the need for universal health care in the U.S. Nothing quite exposes the inequalities that exist in American society more than the health care system. It s a complex combination of private insurance public programs and politics that drives up costs creating significant barriers to lifesaving medical treatment for large segments of the population. In America access to quality health care often depends on income employment and status. Robert Hughes professor of business ethics and legal studies at Wharton is an advocate for universal health care coverage. Drawing deeply on his research in philosophy Hughes believes that equal access to medical care is beneficial for both liberty and social stability. Health he says should not be tied to wealth.  I think it s very disturbing that people have to go to GoFundMe in order to get their medical treatments paid for. It creates a power imbalance he said referring to the crowdsourcing platform used to help raise money for patient bills. That s why I say that truly universal health care would be good for people s liberty. Because you re not really free if you re depending on charity especially discretionary charity like the kind you see on GoFundMe for a basic need like health care.  Hughes recently joined the Wharton Business Daily radio show on SiriusXM to discuss universal health care in the context of the presidential election. Listen to the podcast at the top of this page. Presidentelect Joe Biden has said he will protect and rebuild the Affordable Care Act which has been under attack since it was enacted in 2010 under President Barack Obama. The ACA commonly referred to as Obamacare brought the U.S. closer to providing universal health care through subsidized private health insurance but Hughes said there s still a wide gap. He believes policymakers should ensure that everyone has coverage and access to the same needed treatments.  It s very disturbing that people have to go to GoFundMe in order to get their medical treatments paid for. It creates a power imbalance.   I think it s totally feasible for us to change the health care system if we all were willing to do the right thing. But we re not all willing to do the right thing Hughes said. The professor argued the case for universal health care in a paper titled Egalitarian Provision of Necessary Medical Treatment which was published last year in the Journal of Ethics. The authoraccepted version is here. He examined the health care systems of the U.K. Australia and Canada concluding that Canada s singlepayer system is the most advantageous for the U.S. Private insurance would still exist under such a setup but it could not be used to pay for treatments already covered under universal health care. This provision would eliminate wealth as the controlling factor in health.  I don t understand why there s so much resistance to the idea of truly universal health insurance in the United States given that this is something that other industrial countries just do Hughes said. He acknowledged that the U.S. doesn t have the political will to change a system that s been entrenched since the end of World War II when employers began offering health insurance to their workers instead of higher wages.  We can t wave a magic wand and go back to 1946 he said. I don t see the United States completely uprooting all these insurances. And that means we might need to create a model that keeps a lot of what we have making it more accessible to more people rather than creating all new institutions from scratch.

https://healthcare.procon.org/, 27.5 million nonelderly Americans did not have health insurance in 2021 a decline from 28.9 million uninsured Americans in 2019. The largest group of Americans almost 155 million nonelderly people were covered by employersponsored health insurance. Less than 1 of Americans over 65 were uninsured thanks to Medicaid a government provided insurance for people over 65 years old. The United States is the only nation among the 37 OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations that does not have universal health care either in practice or by constitutional right. Read more background  A national health insurance is a universal health care that uses public insurance to pay for privatepractice care. Every citizen pays into the national insurance plan. Administrative costs are lower because there is one insurance company. The government also has a lot of leverage to force medical costs down according to economic expert Kimberly Amadeo. Canada Taiwan and South Korea all have national health insurance. In the United States Medicare Medicaid and TRICARE function similarly. 178 Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older certain younger people with disabilities and people with EndStage Renal Disease permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant sometimes called ESRD. Patients pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B general health coverage. The 2023 standard Part B monthly premium is 164.90. Patients also contribute to drug costs via Medicare Part D. Most people do not pay a premium for Medicare Part A inpatient hospital stays care in a skilled nursing facility hospice care and some home health care . More than 65.3 million people were enrolled in Medicare according to Feb. 2023 government data. 180 181 Medicaid provides health coverage to millions of Americans including eligible lowincome adults children pregnant women elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by states according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government. More than 84.8 million people were enrolled in Medicaid as of Nov. 2022. 181 182 183 The Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP often lumped in with Medicaid in these discussions is a lowcost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid. In some states CHIP covers pregnant women. Each state offers CHIP coverage and works closely with its state Medicaid program. CHIP covers more than 6.9 million patients. 181 182 183 TRICARE is the military health system that provides care to almost 10 million activeduty service members retired personnel and their families. Activeduty military members pay 0 for health insurance while retired members and their families paid a premium up to 1165 per month for a member and family in 2021. 184 The United States already successfully maintains universal health care for almost 36 of the U.S. population according to U.S. Census data released in Sep. 2022. As the Baby Boomer generation continues to age and more of the generation becomes eligible for Medicare estimates suggest about 73.5 million people will use Medcare and about 47 of American health care costs will be paid for by public health services by 2027. 185 186 If the government can successfully provide universal health care for 36 to almost 50 of the population then the government can provide univeral health care for the rest of the population who are just as in need and deserving of leading healthy lives. A June 2022 study found the United States could have saved 105.6 billion in COVID19 coronavirus hospitalization costs with singlepayer universal health care during the pandemic. That potential savings is on top of the estimated 438 billion the researchers estimated could be saved annually with universal health care in a nonpandemic year. 198  Taking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act we calculate that a singlepayer universal healthcare system is likely to lead to a 13 savings in national healthcare expenditure equivalent to more than US450 billion annually based on the value of the US in 2017. The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for healthcare premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to singlepayer health care would provide the greatest relief to lowerincome households conclude researchers from the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues. 201 According to the National Bankruptcy Forum medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy in the United States. In 2017 about 33 of all Americans with medical bills reported that they were unable to pay for basic necessities like food heat or housing. If all Americans were provided health care under a singlepayer system medical bankruptcy would no longer exist because the government not private citizens would pay all medical bills. 131 Further prescription drug costs would drop between 4 and 31 according to five cost estimates gathered by New York Times reporters. 24 of people taking prescription drugs reported difficulty affording the drugs according to a Kaiser Family Foundation KFF poll. 58 of people whose drugs cost more than 100 a month 49 of people in fair or poor health 35 of those with annual incomes of less than 40000 and 35 of those taking four or more drugs monthly all reported affordability issues. 197 199 200 Additionally 30 of people aged 50 to 64 reported cost issues because they generally take more drugs than younger people but are not old enough to qualify for Medicare drug benefits. With 79 of Americans saying prescription drug costs are unreasonable and 70 reporting lowering prescription drug costs as their highest healthcare priority lowering the cost of prescription drugs would lead to more drugcompliance and lives not only bettered but saved as a result. 197 199 200 Since 2020 the COVID19 pandemic has underscored the public health economic and moral repercussions of widespread dependence on employersponsored insurance the most common source of coverage for workingage Americans . Business closures and restrictions led to unemployment for more than 9 million individuals following the emergence of COVID19. Consequently many Americans lost their healthcare precisely at a time when COVID19 sharply heightened the need for medical services argue researchers from the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues. The researchers estimated more than 131000 COVID19 coronavirus deaths and almost 78000 nonCOVID19 deaths could have been prevented with universal health care in 2020 alone. 198 Another study finds a change to singlepayer health care would save more than 68000 lives and 1.73 million lifeyears every year compared with the status quo. 201 Meanwhile more people would be able to access muchneeded health care. A Jan. 2021 study concludes that universal health care would increase outpatient visits by 7 to 10 and hospital visits by 0 to 3 which are modest increases when compared to saved and lengthened lives. 202 Other studies find that universal health coverage is linked to longer life expectancy lower child mortality rates higher smoking cessation rates lower depression rates and a higher general sense of wellbeing with more people reporting being in excellent health. Further universal health care leads to appropriate use of health care facilities including lower rates of emergency room visits for nonemergencies and a higher use of preventative doctors visits to manage chronic conditions. 203 204 205 An American Hospital Association report argues the high rate of uninsured patients puts stress on the broader health care system. People without insurance put off needed care and rely more heavily on hospital emergency departments resulting in scarce resources being directed to treat conditions that often could have been prevented or managed in a lowercost setting. Being uninsured also has serious financial implications for individuals communities and the health care system. 205 In addition to providing universal health care for the elderly lowincome individuals children in need and military members and their families the United States has the Affordable Care Act the ACA formerly known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or Obamacare which ensures that Americans can access affordable health care. the ACA allows Americans to chose the coverage appropriate to their health conditions and incomes. 187 Veterans Affairs which serves former military members is an example of a singlepayer health care provider and one that has repeatedly failed its patients. For example a computer error at the Spokane VA hospital failed to deliver more than 11000 orders for specialty care lab work and other services without alerting health care providers the orders had been lost. 188 189  Elizabeth Hovde Policy Analyst and Director of the Centers for Health Care and Worker Rights argues The VA system is not only costly with inconsistent medical care results it s an American example of a singlepayer governmentrun system. We should run from the attempts in our state to decrease competition in the health care system and increase government dependency leaving our health care at the mercy of a monopolistic system that does not need to be timely or responsive to patients. Policymakers should give veterans meaningful choices among private providers clinics and hospitals so vets can choose their own doctors and directly access quality care that meets their needs. Best of all when the routine breakdowns of a governmentrun system threaten to harm them again as happened in Spokane veterans can take their wellearned health benefit and find help elsewhere. 188 189 Further the challenges of universal health care implementation are vastly different in the U.S. than in other countries making the current patchwork of health care options the best fit for the country. As researchers summarize Though the majority of postindustrial Westernized nations employ a universal healthcare model few if any of these nations are as geographically large populous or ethnicallyracially diverse as the U.S. Different regions in the U.S. are defined by distinct cultural identities citizens have unique religious and political values and the populace spans the socio economic spectrum. Moreover heterogenous climates and population densities confer different health needs and challenges across the U.S. Thus critics of universal healthcare in the U.S. argue that implementation would not be as feasible organizationally or financially as other developed nations. 190 And such a system in the United States would hinder medical innovation and entrepreneurship. Government control is a large driver of America s health care problems. Bureaucrats can t revolutionize health care only entrepreneurs can. By empowering health care entrepreneurs we can create an American health care system that is more affordable accessible and productive for all explains Wayne Winegarden Senior Fellow in Business and Economics and Director of the Center for Medical Economics and Innovation at Pacific Research Institute. 190 191 Medicareforall a recent universal health care proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders IVT would cost an estimated 30 to 40 trillion over ten years. The cost would be the largest single increase to the federal budget ever. 192 The Congressional Budget Office CBO estimates that by 2030 federal health care subsidies will increase by 1.5 to 3.0 trillion. The CBO concludes Because the singlepayer options that CBO examined would greatly increase federal subsidies for health care the government would need to implement new financing mechanisms such as raising existing taxes or introducing new ones reducing certain spending or issuing federal debt. As an example if the government required employers to make contributions toward the cost of health insurance under a singlepayer system that would be similar to their contributions under current law it would have to impose new taxes. 193 Despite claims by many the cost of Medicare for All or any other universal health care option could not be financed solely by increased taxes on the wealthy. Taxes on the middle class would have to rise in order to pay for it. Those taxes could be imposed directly on workers indirectly through taxes on employers or consumption or through a combination of direct or indirect taxes. There is simply not enough available revenue from high earners and businesses to cover the full cost of eliminating premiums ending all costsharing and expanding coverage to all Americans and for virtually all health services says the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 195 An analysis of the Sanders plan estimates that the average annual cost of the plan would be approximately 2.5 trillion per year creating an average of over a 1 trillion per year financing shortfall. To fund the program payroll and income taxes would have to increase from a combined 8.4 percent in the Sanders plan to 20 percent while also retaining all remaining tax increases on capital gains increased marginal tax rates the estate tax and eliminating tax expenditures . Overall over 70 percent of working privately insured households would pay more under a fully funded single payer plan than they do for health insurance today. 196 The Congressional Budget Office explains A singlepayer system with little cost sharing for medical services would lead to increased demand for care in the United States because more people would have health insurance and because those already covered would use more services. The extent to which the supply of care would be adequate to meet that increased demand would depend on various factors such as the payment rates for providers and any measures taken to increase supply. If coverage was nearly universal cost sharing was very limited and the payment rates were reduced compared with current law the demand for medical care would probably exceed the supply of care with increased wait times for appointments or elective surgeries greater wait times at doctors offices and other facilities or the need to travel greater distances to receive medical care. Some demand for care might be unmet. 207 As an example of lengthy wait times associated with universal coverage in 2017 Canadians were on waiting lists for an estimated 1040791 procedures and the median wait time for arthroplastic surgery was 20 52 weeks. Similarly average waiting time for elective hospitalbased care in the United Kingdom is 46 days while some patients wait over a year. Increased wait times in the U.S. would likely occur at least in the short term as a result of a steep rise in the number of primary and emergency care visits due to eliminating the financial barrier to seek care as well as general wastefulness inefficiency and disorganization that is often associated with bureaucratic governmentrun agencies. 17 190 Joshua W. Axene of Axene Health Partners LLC wonders if Americans really could function under a system that is budget based and would likely have increased waiting times. In America we have created a healthcare culture that pays providers predominantly on a Fee for Service basis FFS and allows people to get what they want when they want it and generally from whoever they want. American healthcare culture always wants the best thing available and has a more is better mentality. Under a government sponsored socialized healthcare system choice would become more limited timing mandated and supply and demand would be controlled through the constraints of a healthcare budget . As much as Americans believe that they are crockpots and can be patient we are more like microwaves and want things fast and on our own terms. Extended waiting lines will not work in the American system and would decrease the quality of our system as a whole. 206 Did You Know?1. 27.5 million nonelderly Americans did not have health insurance in 2021 a decline from 28.9 million uninsured Americans in 2019. 162 1632.

https://www.aafp.org/about/policies/all/health-care-for-all.html, To ensure health care coverage for everyone in the United States through a foundation of comprehensive and longitudinal primary care. The intent of this policy document is to give the American Academy of Family Physicians AAFP and its Board of Directors the needed advocacy flexibility to consider all options that might come before federal and state governments and the American people in working to achieve the goal of health care coverage for all a goal based upon AAFP policy which recognizes that health is a basic human right for every person and that the right to health includes universal access to timely acceptable and affordable health care of appropriate quality. The health care system in the United States is uncoordinated and fragmented and emphasizes intervention rather than prevention and comprehensive health management. Health care costs continue to increase at an unsustainable rate and quality is far from ideal.iii Over the past two decades policies implemented through the Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP and the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA have extended access to affordable health care coverage to millions of previously uninsured nonMedicare eligible adults and children. The uninsured population reached a historic low of 8.8 under the implementation of these policies.iii The greatest gains in coverage have occurred among our most vulnerable populations and young adults. However the rollback of some provisions of these policies has increased the percentage of those uninsured to 15.5iv close to what it was one decade ago when our uninsured rate was nearing 17 with nearly 50 million people uninsured.v Ensuring that all people in the United States have affordable health care coverage that provides a defined set of essential health benefits EHB is necessary in order to move toward a healthier and more productive society. Additionally our health care system must begin to account for and address social determinants that have a profound impact on individual and population health outcomes and costs such as socioeconomic status housing and occupational conditions food security and the environment. As noted by the Commonwealth Fund the design of a system to provide health care coverage to all people will have a deep impact on its ability to make sustainable and systematic improvements in access to care equity quality of care efficiency and cost control. vi Any successful health system reform designed to achieve health care coverage for all must reemphasize the centrality of primary care reinvigorate the primary care infrastructure in the United States and redesign the manner of primary care delivery and payment. Compelling research demonstrates that the everincreasing focus of resources on specialty care has created fragmentation decreased quality and increased cost. Studies confirm that if primary care practices redesign how they operate so that they are more accessible promote prevention proactively support patients who have chronic illnesses and engage patients in selfmanagement and decisionmaking health care quality improves along with the cost efficiency of care.vii Family medicine and primary care are the only entities charged with longitudinal continuity of care for the whole patient. The patient and primary care physician relationship and its comprehensiveness have the greatest effect on health care outcomes and costs over the long term. However the current United States health care system fails to deliver comprehensive primary care because of the way primary care has been and is currently financed. According to the Center for Evaluative Clinical Sciences at Dartmouth now called the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice U.S. states that rely more on primary care have lower Medicare spending inpatient reimbursements and Part B payments lower resource inputs hospital beds intensive care unit ICU beds total physician labor primary care labor and medical specialist labor lower utilization rates physician visits days in the ICU days in the hospital and patients seeing 10 or more physicians and better quality of care fewer ICU deaths and a higher composite quality score.viii The patientcentered medical home PCMH is one approach to providing comprehensive advanced primary care APC for children youth adults and the elderly. It is a model of health care that facilitates a partnership between an individual patient the patient s personal physician and when appropriate the patient s family or caregiver. Each patient has an ongoing relationship with a personal primary care physician trained to provide firstcontact coordinated continuous and comprehensive care. The personal physician leads a team of individuals at the practice level and beyond who collectively take responsibility for the ongoing care of patients.ix Fundamental change is required to shift the direction of the U.S. health system toward one that covers all people and emphasizes comprehensive and coordinated primary care. Current resources must be allocated differently and new resources must be deployed to achieve these desired results. Payment policies by all payers must change to reflect a greater investment in primary care to fully support and sustain primary care transformation and delivery. Workforce policies must be addressed to ensure a strong cadre of the family physicians and other primary care physicians who are so integral to a highfunctioning health care team. Congress andor state legislatures must enact comprehensive legislation to achieve this change. If such legislation only addresses the uninsured and fails to fundamentally restructure the system to promote and pay differently and better for family medicine and primary care any solution will not reach its full potential to achieve the Quadruple Aim of better care better health smarter spending and a more efficient and satisfied physician workforce. To achieve health care coverage for all the AAFP supports bipartisan solutions that follow the above referenced principles are supported by a majority of the American people and involve one or more of the following approaches with the understanding that each of these have their strengths and challenges As noted in the AAFP s Discussion Paper on Health Care Coverage and Financing Models which was commissioned by the AAFP Board of Directors in 2017 each of these options for achieving health care coverage for all has its strengths and challenges which need and deserve to be debated by the American people and their elected officials and representatives. These include but are not limited to the following important issues Advanced primary care embodies the principle that patientcentered primary care is comprehensive continuous coordinated connected and accessible for the patient s first contact with the health system. APC aims to improve clinical quality through the delivery of coordinated longitudinal care that improves patient outcomes and reduces health care spending. The AAFP believes APC is best achieved through the medical home model of practice. We define a primary care medical home as one that is based on the Joint Principles of the PatientCentered Medical Homeix and has adopted the five key functions of the Comprehensive Primary Care Plus CPC initiative which establishes a medical practice that provides comprehensive care and a partnership between patients and their primary care physician and other members of the health care team as well as a payment system that recognizes the comprehensive work of providing primary care. The key functions of a primary care medical home are All proposals or options to provide health care coverage for all will be required to cover a defined set of essential health benefits. At a minimum these would include items and services in the following benefit categories In addition to requiring coverage for EHB all proposals or options will ensure that primary care is provided through the patient s primary care medical home. To foster a longitudinal relationship with a primary care physician all proposals or options will provide the following services independent of financial barriers i.e. deductibles and copays if the services are provided by the patient s designated primary care physician a. Evaluation and management servicesb. Evidencebased preventive servicesc. Populationbased managementd. Wellchild caree. Immunizationsf. Basic mental health care To achieve the goal proposed in this paper to ensure health care coverage for everyone in the United States through a foundation of comprehensive and longitudinal primary care it will not be sufficient to focus on health care coverage and primary care alone. There will need to be an effort aimed at identifying and reducing the costs of health care services including the administrative costs of delivering those services. A health care system that is comprehensive and prioritizes primary care must also emphasize the cost and affordability of care. This is important not only for consumers but also for the decisionmaking of physicians clinicians payers and government agencies. Affordability is a critical component in efforts to reform the United States health care system. The AAFP believes all primary care physicians should be compensated in a manner that is consistent with the AAFP s comprehensive payment model for family medicine and primary care the Advanced Primary Care Alternative Payment Model APCAPM. The AAFP believes the APCAPM is a foundational element of a greater investment in primary care that is essential to a better system of care in the United States. The model builds on previous programs and years of research showing the benefits of movement away from feeforservice FFS payment and increased support for populationbased care. It better supports small and independent practices and reduces administrative burden in the health care system. For any health care system to achieve its goals there will be a need for greater investment in primary care. The AAFP strongly supports increased investment in primary care as part of any U.S. health care system. Family physicians other primary care physicians and primary care teams provide comprehensive primary care through two distinct functions direct patient care and nonfacetoface care which we label as populationbased care. The AAFP has concluded that traditional FFS payment is largely incongruent with these core functions. The APCAPM which is outlined in Figure 1 is better designed to recognize the value of these complementary yet distinct functions. The APCAPM establishes a payment model built on the realization that highquality primary care is delivered through both direct patient care and the populationbased services that are provided by the primary care team. Additionally we believe the revenue cycle for primary care must move to a prospective payment model with a retrospective evaluation for performance and quality. Therefore our model establishes prospective payments for a direct patient care global payment a populationbased global payment and a performancebased incentive payment. Building on our belief that primary care should remain comprehensive the APCAPM maintains an FFS component as a means of driving comprehensive care at the primary care level. The presence of this FFS component recognizes that a comprehensive primary care practice will provide episodes of care that are beyond the scope of the direct patient care global payment. We believe the APCAPM will support a greater investment in primary care and will allow primary care practices of all sizes and in any location to achieve and sustain success through its simplified payment structure and dramatic reduction in administrative burden. More importantly we believe patients will achieve better outcomes and have a more favorable experience through this model. This framework offers important policy options for the AAFP to move the United States toward a primary carebased health care system in which all people have appropriate and affordable health care coverage are provided a medical home and have primary careoriented benefits. This can be achieved only if Congress andor state legislatures act to ensure that these policy objectives are implemented. All people in the United States must have appropriate and affordable health care coverage but this is not sufficient by itself. A fundamental change in the health care system to move toward a primary carebased system is essential to achieve improvements in access quality and cost. Extensive worldwide research supports the value of a primary carebased health care system in which all people are covered.xiv This framework is grounded upon the documented value of primary care in achieving better health outcomes higher patient satisfaction and more efficient use of resources. The United States will only achieve the type of health care system that our people need and our nation deserves through a framework of health care coverage for all that is foundationally built on primary care. i.

In this web dossier we will share the results of a white paper created with several of our customers and detail the feedback we collected on the impact of smart cards used in their environments. Socialized Medicine and healthcare systems 2017 study   Universal Health Coverage is a target defined in the UN Sustainable Development Goals. It is achieved when everybody receives the health care they need without suffering financial hardship. The healthcare sector is an essential part of our society due to its resources roles taken by the state or regional authorities and many stakeholders that it links either directly or indirectly. Indeed government programs for healthcare retirement benefits family allocations and health insurance are national traditions legacies. They have been developed according to four different models. What is universal health care? Discover this video from the World Health Organization. Benefits of universal health care the World Health Organization Lets discover the four basic models and some mixed schemes. Otto von Bismarck created this universal healthcare model in Germany and enacted social legislation between 1881 and 1889.  Therefore health insurance and healthcare access are linked to employment in this system. The model is financed through social contributions rather than taxes. It relies on health insurance funded through social contributions by employers and employees managed by companies and employees representatives. The state must decide on the scope of intervention of health insurance funds and take the appropriate measures if a financial imbalance arises. It was also the case in Belgium France with the decrees of 1945 Luxemburg and the Netherlands. In all countries that have adopted the Bismarck model protection has been extended to include population categories that were not protected initially students independent workers etc.  In France the CMU now PUMa Protection Universelle Maladie universal coverage was voted in 1999 implemented in 2000 and modified in 2016. De facto France is one of the many countries with universal health care.  Implemented in 1942 in the United Kingdom following Lord Beveridges report this social protection system is based on the principle of universal access to health care nondependent on employment.  This access to healthcare is not considered contingent on employment but rather an intrinsic part of citizenship. Public authorities fund this system through taxes rather than through social contributions. A centralized system exists in the United Kingdom and Ireland NHS for National Health System. Denmark Finland Norway Spain Sweden and New Zealand have adopted this model. The National Health Service Servizio sanitario Nazionale or SSN created in 1978 provides universal coverage in Italy. It automatically covers all citizens and residents. More on how to get an Italian health insurance card tessera sanitaria is on this page in English. In contrast a decentralized system has been adopted by Mediterranean countries Greece Spain and Portugal. This model developed during the 1920s in the Soviet Union spread to tUSSRsRs satellite states after 1945. It is named after Nicolai Semashko USSRRs health minister from 1918 to 1930. This socialized medicine is of course the product of a specific political ideology. Healthcare services belonged to the state and the state paid healthcare professionals. Services were usually free but patients had to pay outofpocket fees for medication for example.  The system provided universal access to health care. It was broadly a benefit in the kind system. Central authorities defined coverage levels and the amounts set aside for healthcare spending share of GDP. Healthcare and health insurance systems are radically changing in Central and Eastern European countries. For example public healthcare in Russia is free through a Bismarktype compulsory state health insurance system Obligatory Medical Insurance. Your employer usually pays 2 to 3 of your salary in social charges. A part is paid to the Russian healthcare fund. The public system is funded by the federal and regional budgets and through contributions to the mandatory insurance fund. According to The World Bank public spending on health has been around 5 of the countrys GDP for many years 4.6 in 2020. Its much below the EU average of 10 and well under the Soviet levels of the 1960s 6.6 or the 1970s 6.1. It even reached an alltime low at 2.4 in 2004. Obligatory Medical Insurance plan services are limited mainly covering emergency medical attention. One must pay separately for each provided medical service or procedure for more comprehensive care. Many voluntary medical insurances in the country offer far more extensive coverage. Except for Moscow and St Petersburg hospitals are reportedly worsening with a lack of modern equipment medicine hospital beds and a shortage of specialists. Access to healthcare institutions is complicated in rural areas where their number decreased by 75 between 2005 and 2013 due to the optimization of health reform. Some 17500 cities and villages have no medical infrastructure at all.  Despite these significant healthcare gaps only 5 of Russians use private healthcare. Russias system ranks 58 out of 89 in the 2021 list of countries with the best healthcare systems with a meagre score for infrastructure quality.  The fundamental principle of the American healthcare system is that health is a matter of individual responsibility and private insurance.  There is no compulsory national system and a preponderance of private organizations twothirds of Americans under 65 are covered by employmentrelated insurance.  Public healthcare is only provided for the elderly Medicare and disadvantaged Medicaid not unlike the Beveridge model.  These two programs started in 1965 under the administration of Democrat L.B. Johnson. Both Medicare and Medicaid are under the federal agencys responsibility the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS. CMS directly manages Medicare and oversees Medicaid. The states manage their individual Medicaid programs for their citizens. The idea of universal healthcare a system that delivers goodquality medical care to all citizens and residents regardless of their ability to pay dates back to 1912. Theodor Roosevelt who had served nearly eight years as a Republican president decided to run again on a progressive ticket. He promoted a platform that called for creating a centralized national health service. He ultimately lost the 1912 elections. Accessible and affordable medical care might one day be seen as a right more than a privilege. Harry Truman proposed a national healthcare system twice in 1945 and 1949. After a bruising fight with the American Medical Association and the Republican Party he ended up with no results. More on this The Accidental President. Lyndon Johnsons Great Society campaign included the idea of helping those populations the market economy had left behind instead of a radical change and challenging headon private insurance. According to the New Yorker this blended system functioned well enough in the 70s and 80s covering 80 of Americans through their jobs or one of these programs Nov.2 2020. The 1993 Clinton Health Care Plan included universal coverage and a basic benefits package. The government was to give every American a healthcare security card that will guarantee a comprehensive package of benefits 23 September 1993. Needless to say that nearly a fifth of the population lived just one illness or accident away from personal bankruptcy. In 2010 more than 48 million Americans were uninsured source CDC reports and millions more were underinsured an estimated 16 million adults in 2003. To top it off premiums for family coverage had increased by 97 from 2000 to 2009. The American Medical Student Association AMSA in a 2015 study pointed out that contrary to prevailing stereotypes 80 of the uninsured are hardworking Americans. But they cant obtain insurance through their work for three main reasons The 2006 Massachusetts Health Care Reform also known as RomneyCare because Mitt Romney was the Governor inspired the 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ACA also called ObamaCare.  At the time the RomneyCare reform had been a real success driving the uninsured rate down to 4. As of 2019 the rate is even lower at 2.9. According to Gallup the ACA increased the number of insured citizens and residents but did not achieve universal health coverage. The ACA originally mandated that all residents buy a health insurance policy or face a fine or penalty. Trumps Tax Cuts and Jobs Act TCJA repealed the penalty.  The percentage of uninsured US adults reached 10.6 in Q3 2016 and rose again in 2017 and 2018 to 13.7 by Q4 2018. It rose again in 2019 to an estimated 145 and started to decline in 2020 and 2021. In 2021 only 8.3 or 27.2 million people were uninsured at any point during the year indicating a reduction in the percentage and total number of uninsured individuals from the previous year 8.6 or 28.3 million. It stayed at 8.3 for the first six months of 2022 according to a December 2022 CDC report. According to the American analytics and advisory company Gallup the ACA still earned a split decision from Americans in 2019. Now Democrats have a chance to amplify Obamacare provisions and even with a narrow majority they are wellpositioned to get a few projects rolling. Between 2020 and 2021 there was an overall increase in public coverage. Specifically 35.7 of people held public coverage for some or all of the year in 2021 according to a September 2022 report from the census.gov website. Mixedmodel plans aimed at ensuring healthcare for all. The Bismarck and Beveridge models have had a lasting influence on most European countries.  So what has been done? During the second half of the 20th century all European countries progressively extended universal health care to cover nearly all citizens.  Since implementing the CMU universal healthcare coverage the French system for example has ensured everyone has access to healthcare. Employment no longer determines access to healthcare as is theoretically the case.  But funding methods have not been called into question. In all countries influenced by the English model funding mainly comes from taxes. Social protection is funded through contributions in countries influenced by the Bismarck model such as France or the Netherlands.  These differences in funding are linked to how the system is organized  It is an example of the principle of subsidiarity and therefore under the jurisdiction of national governments.  Europewide cooperation exists particularly concerning patients crossborder mobility with measures like the EHIC and the European Health Insurance Card. It gives the holder the right to access healthcare temporarily in another EU country the UK Norway Iceland Liechtenstein or Switzerland.. Cooperation also facilitates the exchange of knowledge and best practices.  More than 1500 billion is spent on healthcare in the European Union including the UK. Faced with the sharp rise in healthcare costs all European countries have tried to rein in spending while improving the efficiency of universal healthcare systems.   Note that the United States spending per capita is twice as much as Germanys or Frances. The situation was unchanged in 2021. US healthcare spending reached 174 of GDP in 2021. Life expectancy covers many aspects from genetics to hygiene lifestyle and crime rate but can be correlated with health and easy access to health care. Overall universal coverage creates a healthier population and workforce in comparable countries. Thats what we see here. Note that Western European and Canadian males lifespan is 3 to 5 years longer than their US counterparts. This difference is very significant. For 2021 life expectancy rebounded in most comparable countries but continued to decline in the US 76.1 years in 2021. In these countries all are offered access to care and highquality healthcare services. We must give a word of warning here we all know correlation is not causation. More on this topic Why is life expectancy shorter in the US? US healthcare spending does not compare well with other developed countries.  As we said it represents 174 of GDP for 2021 compared to less than 10 in the UK Norway Sweden and Denmark 11 in Italy France or Germany and 115 in Canada. Lower costs of health care and prescription drugs are obtained through negotiation and regulation fewer administrative costs and a simplified and unified system. For example administrative costs account for 8 of total national health expenditures in the US. The other countries range from 1 to 3 CNBC why health care costs so much in the US. In a private healthcare system costs appear substantially amplified.  With universal healthcare systems pricing is more transparent and subject to rules. Medical acts are coded and have the same price tag across the country. Patients can also anticipate their bills. In its article dated 18 December 2018 Vox illustrates with many examples how medical billing across the US can be costly opaque and unpredictable.  According to Vox searches patients pay extravagant prices for all kinds of care which are also hard to prevent. As Vox puts it Even with a PhD in surprise billing you cant avoid steep medical bills. In the US injuries or serious diseases can quickly generate hundreds of thousands of dollars in bills dry out your savings and retirement account or even cost you your home. Thats pretty hard to grasp when you live in Canada the UK Italy or Germany. In countries where socialized medicine is implemented health and health care are less related to social or financial status or education. In the US healthcare inequality is patent and is very much correlated with income inequality as reported by The Balance in its article dated 02 November 2020. The socialized healthcare systems are built on the principle of solidarity. No one is left behind. Everyone can access medical services and has health insurance. And obviously its worth mentioning no one goes bankrupt from medical charges. Read more COVID19 health equity and the battle of preexisting conditions 24 February 2021 Healthier people pay for those in need of health care and treatment is undoubtedly a question of governance. Social protection laws or the absence of these health and health insurance mainly define peoples healthcare coverage rights. Healthcare costs can crush central or regional government budgets if expenses overrun the funding source social contribution or income taxes. This can be caused by longterm trends like an ageing population unemployment a steady increase in chronic diseases or unexpected events like a pandemic. For example COVID19 tests and injections are free for all insured and beneficiaries in France. Medicine can become a less financially attractive career to embrace. Its all the more sensitive in the US where studies are very costly. Medical doctors often have to pay their student loans many years after they have left university.  However this is not the case in Europe where university studies are almost free. General physicians in the US made an average of 218K in 2016 Harvard report. Thats twice the average of generalists in comparable countries where pay ranged from 86K in Sweden to 154K in Germany. The same study notes that the USs quality of care is not significantly different from other countries and excels in many areas.  In France and the UK getting an appointment with a dentist can take weeks. It can take months with an ophthalmologist or a dermatologist. Consequently emergency rooms are often used for the wrong purpose and are overcrowded. More reading about the topic The Best Health Care System in the World Which One Would You Pick? Lets see the three significant challenges when considering healthcare system management. The first challenge is maintaining or improving citizens health by providing healthcare that meets the general publics legitimate expectations medical or otherwise. Issues surrounding the systems funding continuity and proper management are fundamental. There are several priorities for managing the resources available such as Take for example the unintentional effects or complications resulting from medical errors treatment or advice known as iatrogenesis. In the United States the total number of deaths from iatrogenesis in 2001 reached 738936. The deaths caused by cardiac disease were 699697 and 553251 deaths were caused by cancer American Iatrogenic Association 2002. In France in 2004 the number of deaths resulting from iatrogenesis was higher than 10000 and 3.19 of hospital stays were due to medical and medication errors. A financial assessment of this issue is difficult to carry out. No realistic study relating to the amounts involved was to be found. However the causes of the phenomenon are known.  Iatrogenesis can be linked to many factors such as Between 30 and 50 of iatrogenesis could be avoided French Ministry of Health July 2010. Better information systems could play a part in cutting this figure. This reduction is one of the goals of the Personal Medical File.  Most programs in this area aim to facilitate information exchanges helping healthcare professionals concentrate on care and treatment rather than management. This attempt to reorganize the relationships between patients healthcare professionals and administration is much helped by introducing new digital technology for exchanges between healthcare or insurance organizations and creating health cards. These factors can often lead to drastic improvements. In France with the universal health care SESAM Vitale program for example Carte Vitale is a card with an embedded microcontroller certifying health insurance entitlement. The introduction of electronic claim forms and the cutstatement sheets means that 36 billion A4 sheets of paper are saved annually. They are no longer produced printed distributed stored or destroyed.   Ambition optimize the use of medical data. Patients Electronic Medical Records smart EMR ensure that healthcare professionals can access all their medical information whenever and wherever. This record therefore cuts errors and hesitancy in emergencies and improves the quality of services provided. It also enhances cooperation between healthcare workers pooling all available patient information into a centralized file. Electronic Medical Records streamline healthcare systems. Smart EMRs limit the number of medical interventions and ensure consistent patient care. There are also advantages to government health policy a welltreated patient does not have to keep coming back. Telemedicine also presents fantastic opportunities. The term refers to any situation where information is passed between healthcare professionals electronically general practitioners or specialists care workers pharmacists etc.. This information could be messages letters signals results images administrative data complete files or monitoring for diagnosis therapy or monitoring.  Using smart cards speeds up the transition to paperless electronic procedures and data exchanges three formidable catalysts for systems modernization.  In terms of administration the results obtained are impressive.  Yet this technology is often underused in areas where it will produce excellent results. Electronic services that have already been implemented in European countries for universal health care schemes and in the rest of the world with identification systems electronic signatures and electronic authentication clearly show This robust technology can strike at the heart of fraud mechanisms often with minimal infrastructure investment and without significant changes for patients and healthcare professionals. Smart card technology is an invaluable asset to combat healthcare fraud and errors in the interest of all.    Thales provided technical services and products while implementing 11 national electronic healthcare systems including the German Gesundheitskarte picture above or Chifa card an eHealthcare solution in Algeria. Our contribution to these electronic healthcare projects provides an excellent overview of the technology involved its applications the quality of information systems and the social context of its use.

While this type of healthcare system has its benefits there are also drawbacks that are important to consider. 1. Access to Care One of the biggest benefits of universal healthcare coverage is that it ensures access to necessary medical services for all citizens. This includes preventative care as well as treatment for illnesses and injuries. 2. Improved Health Outcomes With access to necessary medical services citizens are able to receive timely treatment and maintain better health outcomes. This can lead to lower healthcare costs in the long run as well as a higher quality of life for citizens. 3. Reduced Financial Burden Universal healthcare coverage eliminates the financial burden associated with seeking medical treatment. Citizens do not have to worry about the cost of healthcare which can be a significant stressor especially in times of illness or injury. 4. Increased Access to Preventative Care Universal healthcare coverage can increase access to preventative care which can help reduce the incidence of chronic illnesses and improve overall health outcomes. 1. Long Wait Times One of the biggest drawbacks of universal healthcare coverage is that wait times for medical procedures can be quite long. This can be particularly challenging for those in need of immediate or urgent care. 2. Reduced Quality of Care In order to keep costs down some countries with universal healthcare coverage may limit the amount of resources and funding available for medical services. This can lead to a reduction in the quality of care provided to citizens. 3. Lack of Provider Availability In areas with a high demand for medical services there may be a shortage of healthcare providers. This can result in longer wait times and a lower quality of care. 4. High Taxes In order to fund universal healthcare coverage taxes in countries with this type of system are often higher than in countries with private healthcare systems. This can be a burden for citizens especially those on a fixed income. In conclusion universal healthcare coverage has its pros and cons. On one hand it provides access to necessary medical services for all citizens and can lead to improved health outcomes. On the other hand it can result in long wait times reduced quality of care and high taxes.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/468401/majority-say-gov-ensure-healthcare.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. A 57 majority of U.S. adults believe that the federal government should ensure all Americans have healthcare coverage. Yet nearly as many 53 prefer that the U.S. healthcare system be based on private insurance rather than run by the government. These findings are in line with recent attitudes about the government s involvement in the healthcare system which have been relatively steady since 2015. In 2000 Gallup began tracking the public s views of whether it is the federal government s responsibility to ensure all Americans have healthcare coverage and has found considerable fluctuation. From 2000 through 2008 majorities ranging from 54 to 69 believed the federal government should ensure universal coverage in the U.S. In 2009 thenPresident Barack Obama s administration worked with Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act ACA which expanded access to private health insurance via new government mandates and subsidies. The bill was ultimately signed into law in March 2010 and until 2012 the public was divided in their attitudes about the government s obligation for healthcare coverage in the U.S. From 2012 through 2014 clear majorities said this was not the government s responsibility. In 2015 the tide again turned and a slim majority felt healthcare coverage was a government obligation. Since then between 51 and 57 of Americans have held this view. The latest findings from Gallup s annual Health and Healthcare poll conducted Nov. 9Dec. 2 2022 show 57 think the government should be responsible to ensure coverage for all Americans while 40 say it should not. Partisans views of the federal government s responsibility in ensuring healthcare for all Americans diverge sharply as they have over the past two decades. Currently 88 of Democrats and 59 of independents but just 28 of Republicans think the government is responsible. While an average 79 of Democrats since 2001 have asserted the government s obligation to ensure healthcare for all in the U.S. an average 71 of Republicans over the same period have said the opposite. A 56 average of independents have said it is a governmental obligation. At the same time that Americans see a government role in ensuring universal U.S. healthcare coverage they prefer that the nation s healthcare system be based on private insurance rather than run by the government. Currently 53 of U.S. adults prefer a private system while 43 support a governmentrun system. Since 2010 when the measure was first tracked the public has consistently favored private insurance with just one exception In 2017 U.S. adults were evenly divided in their preferences. Partisans preferences for the U.S. healthcare system differ sharply with 72 of Democrats in favor of a governmentrun system and 83 of Republicans a private system. Independents tilt slightly toward a private 50 rather than a governmentrun 46 system. Over the past 13 years the percentage of Republicans preferring private insurance has not fallen below 79 it peaked at 91 in 2010 the year the ACA became law. At the same time between 52 in 2013 and 77 in 2021 of Democrats have favored a governmentrun system. Majorities of independents backed a private system from 2010 through 2015 but they have been more divided since then reaching a consensus only once in 2021 when 55 favored private insurance. Americans continue to hold a nuanced view of the U.S. healthcare system with a majority saying the government should ensure that all Americans have coverage but preferring that the system be funded privately. Partisans have fundamentally differing views on how healthcare should be delivered in the U.S. with Democrats indicating support for a system where the government not only guarantees coverage but provides healthcare while Republicans remain wedded to the current system of private coverage and healthcare. Notably Democrats are more unified in their belief that government is responsible for ensuring all Americans have healthcare than in wanting a true public health system. Conversely Republicans are more unified against such medical care than they are against the idea that it is government s job to make sure no American goes without healthcare.
