And we recognize that as community members lawyers and especially as judicial officers we must do more to change this reality....As judges we must examine what those changes must be what biases both conscious and unconscious we bring and how we can improve our justice system so that all who enter are assured they will receive equal treatment. We must continue our efforts to make our court system and its judges reflect the community that we serve. And now I am privileged to serve on one of the most talented and diverse high courts in the nation a collegial bench with a broad range of backgrounds and experience all committed to justice and the rule of law... For the 17th straight year the data shows a steady increase in the number of women and judges of color. Female judicial officers now constitute nearly 40 of all judicial officers. The percentage of Asian Black and Hispanic judicial officers nearly doubled since 2006 when we began keeping data. We ve made progress and have established a solid foundation that we can continue to build on into the future. Last year through a legislative bill we included Native American Day as a judicial branch holiday. This year for the first time through another bill that the Judicial Council supported we will be celebrating Juneteenth as a state holiday. This coming Friday we recognize C sar Ch vez Day. These and other such recognitions are reminders of the importance of the work on Access Fairness Diversity and Inclusion that is ongoing through initiatives across the branch. Last December the Judicial Council voted to amend our Judicial Branch Strategic Plan to further elevate and embrace our representation and responsiveness to individual and group differences to leverage diversity to foster an environment of respect and engagement. And what we did was added inclusion to our number one judicial branch goal. Some may ask why I choose to emphasize diversity in my first State of the Judiciary Address as Chief Justice of California. My answer to you is because it is important. The Judicial Council s Advisory Committee on Providing Access and Fairness is also developing a Racial Justice Toolkit for courts. We re working on expanding genderneutral forms. Education on unconscious bias and the prevention of discrimination and harassment is now mandatory for all judicial officers. And we re continuing to expand language access services. During and after the Great Recession we also studied fines and fees and bail and the impact it has on our most vulnerable populations ...We spoke out against racial injustice We expanded our own diversity equity and inclusion initiatives that are being replicated statewide... The workgroup continues its good work now focusing on jury service. And there are recommendations to have statefunded increases in juror pay and to have jurors complete the questionnaires and the hardship applications online. We believe that those improvements will create a diverse broader prospective jury pool. We must as a society honestly recognize our unacceptable failings and continue to build on our shared strengths. We must acknowledge that in addition to overt bigotry inattention and complacency have allowed tacit toleration of the intolerable. These are burdens particularly borne by African Americans as well as Indigenous Peoples singled out for disparate treatment in the United States Constitution when it was ratified. We have an opportunity in this moment to overcome division accept responsibility for our troubled past and forge a unified future for all who share devotion to this country and its ideal I am deeply disturbed by the tragic deaths of George Floyd and others as well as the action and inaction that led to these deaths. Justice is the first need addressed by the People in the preamble of our nation s Constitution. As public servants judicial officers swear an oath to protect and defend the Constitution. We must continue to remove barriers to access and fairness to address conscious and unconscious bias and yes racism. All of us regardless of gender race creed color sexual orientation or identity deserve justice. Our civil and constitutional rights are more than a promise a pledge or an oath we must enforce these rights equally. Being heard is only the first step to action as we continue to strive to build a fairer more equal and accessible justice system for all. As we head into the third year of our judicial diversity outreach program we are seeing its positive impact. As I mentioned at the beginning we gathered in person for Judicial Conference last fall. It was the first time since 2019. The room looked and felt different we saw more women and more diverse colleagues among us... 13 Diverse law students entering the legal profession have shared with us how inspiring it is to see judges who look like them. Today 17 of judges on the Colorado state court bench are judges of color whereas we only had 10 judges of color four years ago. More strikingly in 2018 we had just one Black District Court judge serving our state. Today we have 15 Black judges 19 including Denver County Court taking the bench each day. We provide experiential learning opportunities for diverse law students through our Judge Lorenzo M rquez internship program and offer networking opportunities with our judges through our popular virtual coffeehouse called Java with Judges. We are also encouraging diverse law students to consider legal opportunities in parts of greater Colorado through a new summer externship program. 14 And importantly proactive work around diversity equity and inclusion will be a significant priority of this office. We are moving forward with this office not simply to implement a recommendation but because we believe that it is the right thing to do. I would be remiss if I didn t recognize another crisis around how our minority communities perceive their treatment in the criminal justice system. To that end we also stepped up our efforts to help diversify the bench. We feel that is an important part of enacting real lasting change. One of the best ways to ensure equal justice for all is to have judges that reflect the communities they serve. Too that end five years ago several of our justices formed a Bench Diversity Dream Team through Colorado s Center for Legal Inclusiveness. The Bench Dream Team became a vehicle to encourage diverse lawyers to consider a career on the bench and to help them navigate the judicial application process. Bench Dream Team members have volunteered countless hours hosting informational sessions meeting with potential applicants and conducting mock interviews. As part of the Dream Team s efforts Justice M rquez teamed with the Center for Legal Inclusiveness the diverse bar associations judges nominating commission members and 9News alum Adele Arakawa to produce a training video for new nominating commission members. Among other things that video teaches commissioners how to combat implicit bias. I am proud to say that Governor Polis appointed more Black women to the bench five in the oneyear period between September 1 2019 and August 31 2020 than in the previous twentyfive years combined. In addition fiftynine percent of judges appointed by Governor Polis in that same time period were female. That has resulted in a nearly 13 percent increase in female judges in the last four years. With that said the protest for racial justice which took place this past summer and more recent events remind us that much work remains to be done. Those events have led us to significantly increase our training around issues of racial equality. Judges Paul Dunkelman and Adam Espinoza through their leadership roles as Presidents of the District Court and County Court Judges Associations respectively have put on a continuing series of excellent webinars on these issues. That court established an Inclusivity Diversity Equity and AntiRacism Committee to combat systemic racism and injustice by promoting acceptance respect and value for all persons and creating an ongoing dialogue to confront biases. To date the Committee has undertaken a number of projects including spearheading amendments to the Court of Appeals strategic plan regarding diversity and inclusion compiling and sharing resources about DEI trainings and facilitating discussions inside and outside the court including with regional law schools and law students on these issues. I must make it clear that I am not disparaging law enforcement or our judicial systems but I am saying that they are not perfect institutions. I am outraged by some of the things that I have seen and heard. With each new revelation my heart breaks even more and like many of you I have long since reached the point that as Fannie Lou Hamer once said I am sick and tired of being sick and tired. The existing imperfections in our justice systems have profound and lasting effect on all of us but it is more severe on those of us who are the most vulnerable. There is a need for real and immediate improvement. America can and must do a better job of providing equal justice under law the very words that are engraved on the front of the United States Supreme Court Building in Washington D.C. I believe that our justice system is one of the best in the world however to quote Victor Hugo Being good is easy what is difficult is being just.  As judges we take an oath to do justice equally to the rich and to the poor regardless of race gender religion sexual orientation or other demographics and our oath requires us to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States. We hold sacred the rights guaranteed by our Constitution and as judges we must listen and do justice to the cases that people bring before us people from all walks of life. Our judges and dedicated court staff take seriously our responsibility to administer justice we work hard to ensure access to justice for all and to make sure our courts are the best they can be to serve our community. The prominence and horror of the George Floyd murder does point to continued divisiveness. But at the same time it also points to unparalleled unity as exhibited by unprecedented numbers of people of all ages races and walks of life who are 1 expressing outrage at the continued unnecessary violence by some police officers against African Americans and 2 asking What can we do to make things better going forward? ...We are grieving right now. And that is proper and healthy. I don t know if we have ever grieved like this before. But by grieving together coming together and supporting one another through all of this I know that we will come out of this better than we were before. And for that I am encouraged. I am pleased to report that as of today 49 percent of our fulltime judges are women. And our judges reflect Hawai i s rich diversity of races ethnicities and backgrounds. In cultivating the values of diversity and inclusion our website contains demographic information about our judges and we require implicit bias training for all judges and staff. In order to build trust in the justice system we must acknowledge and address systemic inequities and we have redoubled our efforts to ensure the Judiciary lives up to the promise of equal justice for all. Hawai i is far from immune from the racial inequity that spurred this summer s protests across the country and at home. We have already taken some important steps by reforming bail and other aspects of our criminal justice system that may have disproportionate impacts by training our judges and judiciary staff on how to recognize and address implicit bias and by increasing access to our civil justice system. Moreover the newly created Criminal Justice Research Institute will leverage data to identify inequity within the criminal justice system. The recent deaths of George Floyd Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery within months of each other have been tragic reminders of the reality that many face every day across our nation. For those of us who work in the justice system which promises equal justice for all this is a time of reckoning that requires careful listening increased education and selfreflection and most importantly action. We have a collective responsibility to hear the voices that have been raised and to address deeply rooted and systemic problems within the structures of our institutions. Racism exists whether it be actualized as individual racism institutional racism or structural racism and it undermines our democracy the fair and equitable administration of justice and severely diminishes individual constitutional protections and safeguards of full citizenship with the attendant rights and benefits sacred to all. People of color have no less expectation of fairness equity and freedom from racial discrimination than others yet they are continually confronted with racial injustices that the Courts have the ability to nullify and set right. Complacency can never be the norm in providing justice. We need to constantly be more attuned to the needs of those who stand before our benches daily. Our courts work to provide equal justice just as the constitution promises. But despite all we are doing the notion of equal justice for all remains elusive to some persons of color in matters across the legal spectrum. What we strive for and what we have reached can be two different things. There s much work to be done. Our judges around the state are taking the lead and convening community forums to tackle issues of race and equity in the justice system. Despite all we have worked to pursue justice remains elusive to many persons of color in matters across the legal spectrum. There is a disconnect between what we aspire for in our justice system and what we have achieved. That may be hard to hear for all of us who work every day for fairness but we must hear the voices that cry out in our streets and towns. We must acknowledge and confront the reality that our fellow community members say is their experience. And it is imperative we take action to change that experience not ignore justify or disparage it. In 2021 we recognized that in order for us to continue to properly serve the people of this great state we need to develop a more comprehensive educational curriculum for judges and judicial branch employees. These educational opportunities would embrace a full range of adult learning. Issues related to race and disproportionality will remain critical components of our educational curriculum. The Kansas judicial branch established a Racial Justice Education Advisory Team in 2020. The team includes leaders from judicial districts of varying sizes who are working to recommend a scalable ongoing racial justice education program for the entire branch. In its initiatory year the team completed an extensive review of relevant materials on the topic of racial justice and compiled a library of related webinars. The team promoted implicit bias training for all judges and court leaders in November. That training remains available ondemand for all staff to watch when schedules allow. Employees and judges in four of the state s largest judicial districts also received a threepart diversity inclusion and sensitivity training. This resource will be shared with the remaining judicial districts as time and funding allow. The team has identified a local provider for cultural competence workshops that can be delivered either in person or by webinar. They are currently seeking grant funding to offer these workshops branchwide. As a justice system we must be willing to recognize our failures. And we must be willing to not only listen but to actually hear the very valid concerns raised by people who have been marginalized degraded or made to feel less than. The court system and the legal profession must continue to advocate for a diverse bench and bar to reflect the communities that we serve. We must continue to improve communication between the courts justice partners and court participants. And we must constantly evaluate and address institutional racism and our own implicit biases. I recognize that we all of us have a long way to go. But I am pleased with the progress the court system has made over the past few years to provide diversity and cultural collision trainings to all judges clerks specialty courts staff and pretrial staff across the state. As Chief Justice and chief administrator of our state s courts I readily admit our justice system falls far short of the equality it espouses. And I see many of its worst injustices meted out in the criminal legal system. Inequities there range from courts being funded with fines levied on poor disproportionately African American defendants to our longtime use of Jim Crow laws to silence African American jurors and make it easier to convict African American defendants. We need only look at the glaring disparities between the rate of arrests severity of prosecutions and lengths of sentences for drug offenses in poor and African American communities in comparison to those in wealthier White communities to see how we are part of the problem. Is it any wonder why many people have little faith that our legal system is designed to serve them or protect them from harm? Is it any wonder why they have taken to the streets to demand that it does? We are working hard at increasing diversity and inclusion and decreasing implicit bias in the Judicial Branch through educational programing and outreach. For example we have a new initiative which started in Lewiston to hire court interns born in Somalia. There is now a standing court committee to address these issues we expect to engage more broadly with our justice partners to expand efforts out into the communities we serve and to try to become a much more diverse and inclusive organization. We are deeply committed to equal justice for all. We have spoken loudly and clearly on the critical need for justice systems to operate free from the scourge of racial bias and discrimination. Justice and the rule of law demand no less. The Judicial Branch has conducted critically important inhouse educational programs on implicit racial bias in the past. Our current and future educational efforts including a threecomponent series on racial justice will continue to focus upon diversity equality and inclusion issues. In addition to continuing educational efforts we will be embarking on a comprehensive introspective study to identify and address systemic racial bias within the judicial system. We need to gather and analyze the data and where any racial inequity appears ask the question Why? and implement systemic changes as necessary to alleviate disparate treatment. We have been gathering information on resources and seeking knowledgeable consultants to help us plan for this major initiative. We will be moving to the actual planning stages in the very near future. The courts have a direct and fundamental responsibility to dispense justice without any hint or even appearance of racism or other bias in all of their insidious forms. Freedom from disparate treatment based upon race is not only a constitutional right it is a basic human right. The mission of the Maine Judicial Branch is to administer justice by providing a safe accessible efficient and impartial system of dispute resolution that serves the public interest protects individual rights and instills respect for the law.  Judges swear to be fair and impartial to do justice in every individual case. That cannot change but we together as members of the system of justice must reexamine how we administer justice. We must determine along with the other branches of government how to ensure that the protections and rights under law are afforded equally to all of us. We must assure that our courts do not suffer bias conscious or unconscious. We must examine together the reasons for disproportionate impact upon people of color and address those reasons. As we emerge from the pandemic we also need to do more to fight another kind of virus that has affected our legal system for far too long the problem of racial and ethnic inequities. Even as we were battling COVID over the last yearandahalf the repeated tragic and unjustified deaths of Black men and women in police encounters across the country sparked a national reexamination of the role of race in our legal system. Here in Massachusetts the longawaited Harvard Law School study on racial disparities in our criminal justice system that was released last fall concluded that Black and Latinx people are overrepresented in the criminal caseload compared to their population in the state and that Black and Latinx people are given longer sentences than their similarly situated white counterparts. And another report issued by the Supreme Judicial Court Standing Committee on Lawyer WellBeing last February called attention to how attorneys of color and from other historically excluded populations often experience differential treatment in our courts. Although issues of racial and ethnic inequities in our legal system are longstanding problems these recent events and reports have reminded us that they are no less urgent than dealing with the pandemic. Left unchecked they undermine the fundamental principle of equal justice for all. Within the courts we have made this issue a top priority. We have begun convening quarterly meetings of the Chief Justices of each court and the Commissioner of Probation to discuss what each court is currently doing and to share new proposals to combat racial and ethnic inequities. As judges we must look afresh at what we are doing or failing to do to root out any conscious and unconscious bias in our courtrooms to ensure that the justice provided to AfricanAmericans is the same that is provided to white Americans to create in our courtrooms our corner of the world a place where all are truly equal. Our Committee for Equality and Justice is tackling several important issues as part of its current strategic plan including developing recommendations to ensure our juries are selected from lists that represent the communities they serve and exploring how our courts can eliminate disparities in probation revocation. Over the past two years the Judicial Branch s Committee for Equality and Justice has done outstanding work in support of those important ideals. As part of its most recent strategic plan the CEJ developed new tools to help educate jurors about implicit or unconscious bias helped support expanded community outreach by our courts and developed recommendations and strategies for increasing diversity in our Judicial Branch workforce. The Committee also began longerterm efforts to help ensure that the racial composition of our juries reflects the diversity of our state and to develop recommendations to address disparities found in a recent report on probation revocations by the Minnesota Sentencing Guidelines Commission. The Committee s work on those two issues along with a host of other important initiatives will continue as part of the CEJs next twoyear strategic plan. That plan was just approved by the Judicial Council last week. I understand your 101st General Assembly is the most diverse in history more closely representing the Missourians back home you are here to serve. In the judiciary our diversity is improving as well. Of the judges recently appointed under Missouri s nonpartisan court plan 14 have been women judges of color or both. However as events from the Ferguson protests through the racial unrest during the past year have shown we still have work to do as a society. As designed our legislative and executive branches are where we can take our arguments for changes in law and policy and our judicial branch is where we take our legal disputes for a peaceable resolution. But our judicial branch does not work as intended if we are not trusted to provide a fair and impartial forum for all people to have their cases heard and decided. In recognition of this constitutional imperative we also continue the courts efforts to address implicit bias and institutional racism that exist systemically throughout our country. As of July 2019 all lawyers licensed in Missouri are required to include at least one hour of implicit bias training in their 15 hours of annual continuing legal education. Missouri judges and court staff already were required to complete annual implicit bias training. In early June of 2020 many Chief Justices across the nation addressed the civil unrest stemming from incidents of racial injustice. My message directed to the public and to our court community is available in the Supreme Court s Annual Report provided to each of you in the packet you received today. No institution in this State plays a more pivotal role in ensuring equal access to justice than Nebraska s courts. There is no place in our court system for racial discrimination or inequality. We have recently begun a Racial Equity Initiative through our Access to Justice Commission. This threephase process is designed to engage court users and the public in determining equal access deficiencies in our courts. In phase one we surveyed court users in November and based on those survey results we are reviewing the barriers the marginalized populations in our State have said that they face in our courts. Phase two will involve focusgroup sessions with community leaders across the State and in phase three we will host larger publiclistening sessions giving Nebraskans another opportunity to reflect on access and fairness within the justice system. Our judicial branch has the sacred duty of achieving the lofty goals professed in our State s motto and Constitution. I am proud of the significant role Nebraska s courts have had in carrying out this duty including some of our recent accomplishments recounted below. But this is a time when we must ask ourselves Is there a way we can do this better? The answer to that question is yes. Yes we must find ways to recognize deficiencies in equal access to justice in our courts and yes we must find ways to address those deficiencies. Justice and fairness lie at the heart of our legal system. And those standards must apply equally to all. Wherever it exists in the criminal justice system we must identify and root out bias in all forms. The courts must be a place where court users attorneys and court employees can all expect to be treated with fairness dignity and respect regardless of their race or background. In 2020 in the wake of social unrest the Supreme Court created the Commission on Equity and Justice. This commission has been hard at work studying issues related to race and bias in our justice system and is working to promote diversity among judges and judicial employees. The Commission s goal is to give New Mexicans equitable access to the state s justice system through training and education of judges and staff conducting a review of case outcome data creating a diverse pipeline to the Judiciary reviewing and reforming all policies procedures and jury instructions and focusing on the courthouse experience for litigants. We have also continued to address the problems highlighted in the Equal Justice Report by increasing and mandating antibias training for judges and court personnel. In our Family Courts in particular we have mandated that mediators undergo domestic violence training similar to the biennial training required of our judges.  Through a public awareness campaign and the posting of notices in our courthouses we have encouraged and educated litigants on how to report concerns of bias or unfair treatment. Responses indicate that court users are now more aware of their rights responsibilities and avenues for recourse. Consistent with recommendations from Secretary Johnson s Equal Justice Report we have created and distributed mandatory bias training for judges nonjudicial staff court officers and uniformed personnel. We have similarly adopted antibias training requirements for mediators arbitrators and neutral evaluators involved in courtsponsored alternative dispute resolution programs which will increase awareness and equip these professionals with tools to combat bias and promote inclusivity. Responses to the juror orientation video rolled out last year to educate jurors on the dangers of bias have been overwhelmingly positive. And our courts have engaged directly with their communities to learn and improve as reflected particularly well by the Seventh Judicial District s Judicial Observation Project a unique initiative in which specially trained community observers monitor courtrooms to help judges better identify and guard against unconscious bias. Our Office for Justice Initiatives local Equal Justice Committees judges court officers and staff have participated in career fairs school visits student tours and civic engagement programs throughout the state. Initiatives such as these Franklin H. Williams Judicial Commission ensure that underrepresented populations are provided career advancement support and strengthen ties between our courts and their local communities. Finally we are pleased to observe that in 2022 we welcomed more judges of color to the bench and witnessed several historic moments. In May the Appellate Term of the 2nd 11th and 13th Judicial Districts held oral arguments for the first time before a panel of judges who are all women of color Justices Michelle Weston Wavny Toussaint and Cheree A. Buggs. Just a few months later in the Second Department Justices Valerie Brathwaite Nelson Cheryl E. Chambers Paul Wooten and William G. Ford comprised the first all African American appellate panel in that Court s history. The Unified Court System continues to support measures that enhance judicial diversity with respect to nationality ethnicity race gender identity or expression and other aspects of background and identity. Based on his findings Secretary Johnson issued a comprehensive report that while commending the Court System s judges and staff for their commitment to equal justice identified significant issues in need of reform including the secondclass treatment of people of color in the State s highvolume courts and the need for greater diversity and inclusion within the judiciary and Court System workforce. The Chief Judge dedicated much of this year s address to the courts efforts to remedy such inequities. Our work is just beginning And for so long as I have the privilege of serving as Chief Judge we will not rest on empty platitudes We will work tirelessly on changing the identified institutional policies rules and practices that perpetuate inequities in our courts. In late 2019 I asked the New York State Justice Task Force which is dedicated to addressing the systemic causes of wrongful convictions and the fairness of our criminal justice system to examine the bases for apparent racial disparities at key stages of the criminal justice process from arrest to sentencing. After analyzing available statewide statistics the Task Force focused on the disproportionately high rate at which felony charges against Black and Hispanic defendants are dismissed and whether unjust charges are being filed at inception in those cases. The Task Force heard presentations from a host of agencies on this issue and quickly concluded that data regarding the underlying reasons for dismissal of felony charges was not being accurately or consistently captured preventing a reliable assessment of the factors driving the high dismissal rate. Concurrently the Office of Court Administration OCA began implementing legislation enacted last year requiring the publication of monthly statistical reports on the race ethnicity sex age disposition sentence and other data concerning individuals charged with criminal offenses in our courts. Upon reviewing this data the Justice Task Force again concluded that the standards and protocols used by different agencies to report case dispositions was in need of improvement. The Task Force formed a Working Group to partner with OCA to address statewide data collection and reporting practices and this initiative is moving forward on a fasttrack with recommendations expected by June. Secretary Johnson and his team conducted an intensive fourmonth study interviewed hundreds of individuals and issued a comprehensive report with a set of practical recommendations that we have fully embraced and are now in the process of implementing in an open and transparent manner. And while we are encouraged by his finding that our judges and court professionals are striving to get it right when it comes to equal justice we have accepted our shortcomings and our responsibility to do better in a number of areas including the ways in which we serve minority litigants in our highvolume courts how we investigate and prosecute complaints of racial bias and discrimination within our ranks and the need to strengthen our commitment and support of meaningful inclusion and diversity at every level of our court system. Providing equal justice under the law is at the very heart of our mission as a court system. It is our very reason for being and it is incumbent upon each one of us judges court professionals and public servants to ensure that every person who appears before us and every colleague we work with is treated with fairness dignity and respect. There can be no higher priority for us and we will lead by example at every level and from every position we hold. And that commitment starts at the top. The death of George Floyd and the issues it has brought into harsh focus are a painful reminder of the repeated injustices and institutional racism that have long undermined the values and unity of our nation. The court system s commitment to these values is especially vital. Their preservation is a cornerstone of the rule of law the subject of sacred oaths taken by all judges and lawyers and the daily endeavors of the thousands of court employees around the State who work tirelessly to advance the cause of justice. As the mother of twin sons who are young black men I know that the calls for change absolutely must be heeded. And while we rely on our political leaders to institute those necessary changes we must also acknowledge the distinct role that our courts play. As Chief Justice it is my responsibility to take ownership of the way our courts administer justice and acknowledge that we must do better we must be better. This year I brought a new dimension to the Court in the Office of Diversity Equity and Inclusion. Dr. Adrianne Fletcher joined the Court from Case Western Reserve University. And one of her first projects is working with the judiciary the bar and community partners to ensure we consider a diverse candidate pool for positions at the Court to ensure no qualified person is overlooked. Competency should drive hiring decisions. And there should be no barriers for qualified individuals seeking employment at the courts or anywhere else. Adrianne is working with the Judicial College to raise awareness of inherent bias and ensure legal access is not denied or defined by the color of a person s skin their background disability gender age religion or any distinguishing characteristics. This is the next step for the Court to examine how we do things. And this is a resource available to you and your courts as well. Courts by their creation and purpose are to be unbiased and must treat all equally under the law. Despite the good that courts have done over the past 230 years for some courts are not to be trusted. The perception is that the system is rigged against minorities and people who are poor and that there is an unequal application of justice. The judiciary can address its trust problem. It starts with every judge individually in every county and city. It is imperative that every judge embrace the truth that we are public servants and not imperious panjandrums. As members of the judicial branch we are cautious always careful not to prejudge situations. But we cannot ignore the risks that African Americans Blacks and other people of color face as each day dawns. The urgency for action has long been upon us but the immediacy of the need is even more apparent today. We must ensure that the lives of African Americans Blacks and people of color are valued and respected and that the color of peoples skin does not affect their rights to justice or the treatment they are afforded by our system of justice...Our courts are an integral part of the justice system and have an essential role to play in ensuring justice for all. We must stand firm against racism and oppression. We must be intentional in our efforts to move in a different direction. We must examine our individual thoughts and beliefs as well as our professional approaches processes and environments to address the impact of our own biases. We must examine anew what we are doing or failing to do to root out conscious and unconscious bias in our legal system. Our goal must be to achieve a system of justice that is accessible to all and treats all persons equally. We ought not lose sight of the fact that our courts are largely populated by dedicated attorneys efficient court personnel honest jurors and fairminded judicial officers. Yet bias does exist and we all must remain vigilant to recognize it and ensure that it plays no role in our court proceedings. Racism still exists and has no place in our society. Upon entering service in the judiciary we swore to uphold the constitutions of the State of Tennessee and the United States. Thus it is our moral obligation and our sworn duty to ensure that the people of Tennessee receive equal protection of its laws. Justice must be for all. Critical conversations are taking place in communities across Texas about equality and justice under the law. The Supreme Court of Texas and the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals with support from the Children s Commission spearheaded efforts to facilitate these discussions in their Beyond the Bench Law Justice and Communities Summit. All Texans may find videos and resource materials from the summit here as well as a toolkit for fostering dialogue throughout the state about solutions for enhancing the publics trust in our justice system. We are painfully aware that municipal courts like ours have historically been situated on or at least very near the tip of systemic racism s spear. See e.g. U.S. Dep t of Justice Civil Rights Div. Investigation of the Ferguson Police Department March 4 2015 at 4261 detailing how the practices employed by the Ferguson Municipal Court exacerbated existing racial disparities. Although our court has made a deliberate and concerted effort to reverse these practices we understand as Malcolm X did that there is a significant difference between retracting an injurious blade just a little bit and bringing about the complete healing of a longstanding wound.  Our branch is strongly committed to ensuring that our initiatives projects programs and research are planned and conducted with an equity lens making sure to consider the disparate treatment of and outcomes for racial and ethnic minorities throughout the justice system and how new efforts can either exacerbate those barriers or work to eliminate those disparities. We learned a great deal from the Task Force 2.0 presentation to the Supreme Court in July 2022 detailing specific recommendations in 14 areas to address this racial disparity. The Task Force was launched by the deans of Washington s three law schools following the death of George Floyd nationwide protests for racial justice and a June 4 2020 Open Letter written by justices of our state Supreme Court challenging members of the judiciary and legal community to recognize racial injustice and take steps to eliminate it. Another illuminating presentation came June 1 2022 from the Washington Supreme Court Minority and Justice Commission exploring how reparations for Black Americans can begin to counteract the ongoing harmful legacy of slavery and the decades of antiBlack discrimination that have followed. We also continue to learn from the expansive deeply detailed study by the Gender and Justice Commission released in late 2021 about the impacts of gender and race combined on justice. For instance the study revealed the stunning fact that women of color in Washington particularly Black and Indigenous women are convicted and sentenced to incarceration at rates two to eight times higher than are white women. This demonstrates why it is so important for our branch to continually look at the data and to keep searching for causes and solutions. One finding of the study highlighted the lack of minority women on juries. This leads me to our legislative proposals this coming year to fund programs aimed at increasing jury diversity and improving data that can guide our efforts to build a more just and equitable court system. Studies have shown that racially diverse juries spend more time deliberating make fewer errors and result in fairer trials than nondiverse juries. Our proposal would continue a 2021 Jury Demographic Survey would establish pilot projects to explore if free childcare or increased juror pay would improve diverse response rates and would allow courts to email jury summons in addition to sending them to physical addresses. Our Data for Justice Initiative would expand research capabilities at the Washington State Center for Court Research within the Administrative Office of the Courts which would support courts in collecting and analyzing data reporting performance measures and provide training in using data for implementing equitable change.  As judges we must recognize the role we have played in devaluing black lives. This very court once held that a cemetery could lawfully deny grieving black parents the right to bury their infant. We cannot undo this wrong but we can recognize our ability to do better in the future. We can develop a greater awareness of our own conscious and unconscious biases in order to make just decisions in individual cases and we can administer justice and support court rules in a way that brings greater racial justice to our system as a whole.

Music is Headway by Kai Engel from the Free Music Archive CC BY.  David Levi Hello and welcome to Coping with COVID a podcast and video series that examines pressing issues for our courts and legal system during the time of the COVID19 pandemic. I am David Levi director of the Bolch Judicial Institute at Duke Law School and president of The American Law Institute. Today we look at how our courts and judges are addressing racism and racial disparities. It is a large and complex topic and so many of our institutions are undertaking selfstudy and selfcriticism. As we begin let us acknowledge the horrific attack on the son and husband of one of our colleagues US District Judge Esther Salas our hearts go out to her. Joining me today are four wonderfully capable judges from the state and federal courts. Cheri Beasley is the Chief Justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court and a graduate of our Duke Law Master of Judicial Studies program. So she is both my chief justice and a former student. Welcome Cheri. Goodwin Liu is an Associate Justice of the California Supreme Court and a member of the Council of The American Law Institute. Welcome Goodwin. Raymond Lohier is a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit and also a member of the Council of The American Law Institute. Welcome Ray. And Charles Breyer Chuck we call him is a senior district judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of California. He served as vice chair of the US Sentencing Commission from 2013 to 2017 and he is still a member of the Commission. Welcome Chuck. We go back a very long way. I thank all of you for joining me here today. Chief Justice Beasley let s begin with you. On June 2 you made a statement about the North Carolina Courts on racial equity and other courts and chief justices have followed your lead. In your statement addressing racial equity you said and I m quoting As Chief Justice it is my responsibility to take ownership of the way our courts administer justice and acknowledge that we must do better. Can you expand on this point please? And tell us where and how the North Carolina courts must do better in assuring racial equity. Cheri Beasley You know I think often as judges we think that we have no role in addressing racial or gender disparities in our courts. I think often we believe that that responsibility lies with the legislature or with executive agencies. And I think we have to really rethink our role. All of us as judges should see ourselves as leaders of the judicial branch of government. We run our courts every single day. And I think we have to think differently about racial disparities and see that we really do have a direct responsibility to address them. But certainly our work and the disposition in our cases directly impact the outcomes in our cases. And we really ought to see that we have a viable role in thinking about how to do that. I think we also should be thoughtful about having constructive conversations among ourselves as judges. And I fully acknowledge that this is very very difficult to do. But I also think that in doing that we have to be open to educating ourselves differently. I think we have to be mindful that in the very same way that we have CJEs around subject matter practice areas of the law. But we also have to do that around implicit bias and race. But not just race but really the history of race in our legal system. And I think acknowledging that will really allow us to think differently to really expound upon our own experiences and share them and really offer a greater opportunity to allow greater confidence in the way we apply the rule of law in our courts. David Levi Thank you very much. Justice Liu the California Supreme Court also issued a statement on racial equity and fairness and did so this past June. And the statement says in part We must confront the injustices that have led millions to call for a justice system that works fairly for everyone. Each member of this court along with the court as a whole embraces this obligation. So perhaps you could expand on that a bit and explain what the courts what the court as a court or individual justices will be focusing on as they seek to discharge the obligation that your statement identifies. Goodwin Liu Sure. Thank you David and thank you for putting together this program and it s an honor to be on this panel with my esteemed colleagues. First let me take the opportunity to applaud Chief Justice Beasley for her very early statement and leadership about these issues. I think Chief Justice Beasley when you spoke out you were one of the first if not the first of our state court leaders to really powerfully capture the moment and urge us all to be better. And I think that was an inspiration certainly to our court and to many other courts around the country. Look I think the reality is that it s almost clich I think to talk about unconscious bias or structural racism or institutional inequity. These are almost like buzzwords today but it should not be lost upon us that when you looked out at the massive protests that were happening it didn t escape my notice that some of the ire was directed at courts and at courthouses. I was just on a program the other day with our colleague ALI member Justice Monica M rquez in Colorado where she sits on a state high court and she described the protests there and the graffiti that was painted on her own courthouse and the windows that were broken in her own courthouse. Now of course none of us I think condone any of that behavior. But it should not be lost upon us that this is not just a law enforcement problem. It s not a problem just for legislature that when people talk about the system and they talk about institutional racism they are talking about the courts. We are the system. And I think we have to reckon with that and come to grips with that and I think our statement that our court made was partial acknowledgment of that. Now there are many things that we have to do. I think it begins right at home. In small ways our own court even before the incidents of the past couple months had begun its own diversity and inclusion committee inside the court to look at our own practices and help make all the members of our court staff be more welcome. We have to look throughout the judiciary at implicit bias training and recommit ourselves to that. We have to have a much more robust access to justice agenda. Because we know that that set of issues disproportionately affects minority and low income communities. But at the end of the day I think what Chief Justice Beasley said also rings true which is that we have to examine the law. And I think that we can do all the implicit bias training we want. but at the end of the day what people do care about is what decisions courts make whether it s sentencing decisions whether it s how we define the doctrine of racial discrimination all of these things I think have to be on the table in a sense for examination if we are going to understand why it is that so many millions of people not just in this country but even throughout the world responded so powerfully to the idea that the justice system is not quite living up to its aspiration of equal justice under law. David Levi Thank you. It s so interesting. We re going to come back to some of the points that the two of you made in our more general discussion. Judge Lohier you ve been involved in some of the educational programs for judges. So we re shifting gears here a little bit. The Federal Judicial Center has quite a good educational program for federal judges. What would you say I know that s hard to answer in a very short period of time but what do you think judges need to know or do and how should they talk to one another about race in their conferences and in their opinions? Raymond Lohier That is a difficult question. But before I start I also want to thank you David for bringing together this terrific panel. I m really honored. And I want to thank my fellow colleagues on the panel for everything that they ve already said and done in this important space and it s just an incredibly important and timely conversation. So let me just give you a little bit of background on the educational programs that I ve been involved in with the Federal Judicial Center the FJC. So a few years ago thenChief Judge Ted McKee of the Third Circuit and I were visiting the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington DC. And for those of you who have not visited that museum you should. It s just a magnificent and deeply deeply moving experience to go through the museum. You can t do it all in one day. But everyone should try to do that. And in part I say that because it really provides you with a much better understanding. And I say this as an African American a much better understanding the history of people of African descent in the United States and perhaps more importantly how fundamentally integral that history is to United States history to American history. And you can t really delink those two things. Those stories are deeply deeply embedded in each other. And as you go through the museum as we went through the museum there was a number of federal judges who were there for a conference. And you see the movement from despair to triumph from slavery to freedom from really forms of evil to forms of grace throughout our history our shared history it made me and Judge McKee think that the experience should be an experience that every new federal judge has. So we approached the Federal Judicial Center Jeremy Fogel at that point and counseled them and it didn t take a lot of advice to make a visit to the museum a component of baby judges school for new judges federal judges. And then thereafter to have a panel discussion on race and about race to which all new federal judges will be invited. And of course as you may know David as a former federal judge and Chuck you probably also know once you suggest something in federal judiciary you sort of own it. So I was asked to participate in the first panel discussion. And it was just such a memorable experience with a panel of judges including myself and it was a racially diverse panel roughly racially diverse group of judges in the audience. And we had a frank conversation about race. And I gathered from the conversation that that was the first time that a number of judges in the audience had had a frank conversation about race. Not just in the legal context but in the personal lived experiences that we all have in connection with race. I remember talking about my own experiences professionally and personally as an African American man and telling everybody that here I am a Second Circuit court judge. But the very first thing I guarantee you that people will see when they see me or notice when they see me is that I m a Black male. And then we move on from there. So I do think that we should expand what s been done with baby judges school and the new judges at the federal level to all judges. Now I will also say that there are other opportunities for educating ourselves as federal judges as state court judges on this issue of race. And there are other venues and we can talk for example about judicial conferences that at the federal level we have yearly or every two years. We can talk about other avenues for a discussion about bias implicit or otherwise. But those are all things that I ve explored with my colleagues. One other area that I think is important and shouldn t be forgotten is just the everyday interactions that we have as judges with each other as a group on an individual oneonone basis at voting conferences or in the context of board of judges meetings where we can talk about issues. And again these are uncomfortable conversations sometimes. But I think that there s the space there to have these discussions. David Levi I think that s such a great idea. And I think you ll agree with me that maybe this reflects my Ninth Circuit background but we re not just talking about African Americans. We have so many different racial groups tribes and others with such interesting stories to tell who ve had different kinds of adversity and find themselves in different circumstances. It s a very very rich and interesting topic and important to the context and how we understand the world around us which is very important for judges. Chuck you ve been on the Sentencing Commission now for several years. And when I looked up the commission today I see that most of the positions are vacant but you still have survived which is wonderful for the courts. But there s something disturbing that s been happening. Way back when I was a judge Cliff Wallace at the Ninth Circuit asked me to chair the Ninth Circuit Task Force on race and religious fairness in the courts. And we did a study of sentencing. And we did not find racial disparity. But at that time the guidelines were being applied very rigorously. And of course the reasons why judges didn t like the way in which the guidelines were applied and over time the courts have loosened they ve increased the discretion the judges have under the guidelines following the Booker opinion by the United States Supreme Court. And the US Sentencing Commission now sees racial disparity in federal sentences. And in a 2017 report the commission found that Black defendants are accused of the same offenses and with the same aggravating and mitigating factors received heavier sentences than white defendants. And I think most troubling for judges this is a quote The report found that Black male offenders were 21.2 less likely than white male offenders to receive a nongovernment sponsored downward departure or variance. So that would be a downward departure based on the judge s own assessment of the defendant. How should we think about this? And how should we address it? Charles Breyer Well first David let me thank you for putting together this panel. I think that I was sort of looking for silver linings. I think we all are in this terrible time of the pandemic. But one small silver lining has been that it s given us an unparalleled opportunity to sort of think in an uninterrupted way. I and a number of my colleagues have been thinking about this issue and in large part are prompted by the protest movement. I must say that that has piqued my conscience and my sort of sense of self satisfaction which I think a lot of judges have which is As long as I m fair as long as I apply the law equitably that s what I can do. That s my job. And that s what I can do. And what it does is while that s true assuming you can address the implicit bias or unacknowledged bias as long as you can do that yes you can try to be as fair as you are. But that doesn t mean that the system is fair. And the protests that we have seen the attack on the courthouses in particular is really a wakeup call for all of us because as judges we try to embody the institutional concerns of being fair. And I think we ve fallen far short of that. So then the question is Well why? How has that happened? And you go to one area that I know a little bit about the Sentencing Commission and I take a look at how has that law developed and has it developed in a way that s fair across the board? So the idea of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 was a simple idea. It was that a defendant who is situated in a particular way committing a particular federal crime should be sentenced the same way whether he or she is in Omaha Nebraska or San Francisco California or Miami Florida. It shouldn t make a difference as to sentencing. And so the sentencing guidelines were designed in a way to try to reduce sentencing disparities. Congress at the same time told us look you can t consider things like what we would call the socioeconomic factors of an individual. You can t consider a person s race you can t consider a person s education you can t consider a person s job prospects. All you consider are these particular factors. And as a result sentencings at the time that you took a look at it David were reasonably uniform not completely but primarily uniform. Then the sentencing guidelines became elective that is advisory. And judges at this point now can take into account all of those factors. And as a matter of fact they arguably have to under the law. They have to take a look at the history and characteristics of the offender. So suddenly you have back into the mix all of those factors that you thought you didn t have to consider. Well the problem is the real problem is that of course those factors are racially based or sociologically based. That is to say a white person will have on the average perhaps a better education perhaps a better job prospects perhaps greater family support. And so that person is given a more favorable treatment than an individual who does not have those advantages. So as a result the disparities become even greater when you when you look at sentencing. When this report came out I will tell you that the reaction of the members of the Commission and the reaction of my colleagues was remarkable because each person said Oh I m not a racist. What are they talking about? These statistics must be wrong. There must be something inaccurate in the gathering of these statistics or it s about the other person. It s not about judge me. It s about judge X or it s about judges in this region not judges in that region. Well the answer is no. The statistics are correct. And what they embody is really the sociological experiences and makeup of our country. That is to say that the racism that is part of this society is then institutionalized in the sentencing guidelines. Let me give you an example really a concrete example of what I mean. Everyone agrees when I say everyone that means I and few of my colleagues agree that the criminal history a person s record rap sheet is an indication of how dangerous that person is or whether that person is likely to recidivate. A person who has a high criminal history has obviously recidivated more frequently than a person with a lower one. That s just logic okay. So you say Ah I want to take that into account. And indeed the guidelines do take that into account. One person who has a small record person who has a large record will be sentenced differently under the guidelines. So you take a look at it you say there that s a perfectly fair application. And there s a principle. The problem is that when you take a look at the experience as an example of African Americans they are far more likely to be arrested and prosecuted than the white person in a particular neighborhood it s just the experience of America. And so that person will in all likelihood have a higher criminal history. And then you apply the guidelines of the higher criminal history and that person will get a more severe sentence. So what this is to me is as I ve said a call to take a look at these look at these factors and go behind the statistics and try to figure out why are these statistics showing what they are showing? Because clearly they re showing the factor of race is being considered in connection with sentencing. David Levi Thank you Chuck. That was extremely interesting. It s not clear exactly how to address that. But I think the point that you make and I d like to put this out here to our panel generally is that the courts are quite dependent on decisions that other agencies and parts of government make. We might draw a bit of an analogy between the 2017 Sentencing Commission Report and the 2014 I think it was report of the Department of Justice about Ferguson which was such I think a wakeup call particularly for the chief justices around the country that the courts are being used the state courts as revenue collection agencies for many of our municipalities. And that this has horrible disparate impacts on minority communities and it s extremely regressive and it created a very difficult situation in Ferguson where the minority community had entirely lost confidence in its courts. So whether it s through evictions or it s through these fees and fines that are imposed on minor petty offenses or whether it is federal sentencing things that in the abstract are objective and nonracial have when they re translated through the system they have these disparate racial effects. And the public understandably is At the end of this process there s a judge saying to a defendant You owe X amount or you are going to jail if you don t pay it or you get this sentence or you get that sentence. And this is what people experience. They experience this as a decision of the courts. How do the courts in a sense declare their independence or push back on some of these decisions which they can t actually make but which they also are defined by? And I ll just throw that out there. Maybe Cheri you could take the first crack at this. Because I know the conference of chief justices has been extremely concerned about what happened in Ferguson and what continues to happen around the country in terms of fees and fines. Cheri Beasley You know part of what I heard Chuck say is that the process does not begin with sentencing. That there s a whole process before you get that far. And what happens to Johnny at the point that he is stopped or picked up makes a whole lot of difference. If Johnny is in a grocery store and takes a candy bar what happens after that? It can very well determined what Johnny s future even looks like. You know Johnny is under the age of 16. And Johnny is taken home to his parents scolded he did a bad thing and then they move on and disciplined. And that s one path. But the other path that Johnny might take depending on his race might be that Johnny goes to juvenile detention and then that s a whole other process. And the outcome for Johnny if Johnny goes to juvenile detention is very different than the outcome for Johnny if Johnny s parents pick him up from the police station or the police drop him off at home. There are disparities around fines and fees. In North Carolina roughly almost 60 of the people who show up in our state courts come as selfrepresented litigants. Which means a whole host of things for these people as they re trying to navigate through the court system. Currently we have selfhelp forms and we are about to start a website that will look a whole lot like sort of TurboTax which will allow a selfrepresented litigant to go online answer some questions and help them to fill out some pleadings in some of the cases that come before our court. You know North Carolina is the ninth most populous state in the nation. We have a population of roughly 10 million. We have about a million people whose drivers licenses are revoked not because they in some way have committed a crime but it s because they were not able to pay the initial fines and fees assessed by the court. Those fines and fees snowball and it s not uncommon for people s driver s licenses to be revoked 10 and 15 years down the road. You and I take for granted what a driver s license means. But you know what a barrier that can be in people s lives if they re not able to drive legally. One of the things we ve done is we ve got quite a few driver s license restoration programs. But that s a lot of folks who have not committed a crime who had an initial charge of speeding couldn t pay the fine of 200 and the cost of court which is another 250. And to ask somebody to cough up 450 500 at a time is a lot. And so the other piece around economic justice and racial and gender justice really does bear ability to pay. I mean the Supreme Court of the United States has told us as judges we should be asking about ability to pay and making serious inquiries about that. And I think in great measure as we talk about restorative justice and as we talk about ways to make sure that judges are making the kind of inquiries that they really should so much is understanding the backstory. And while the sentencing guidelines aren t the same as the federal certainly the state system we do have them in North Carolina. And judges do have some leeway. But the reality is there are some guidelines that just are not in writing. When the party or the defendant and often when we think about justice we think about criminal justice but I think we have to think about civil justice and juvenile justice and family justice. But often when the person walks into court how they appear how are they dressed? Do they come with a pocket of cash because they don t use traditional banking systems like many of us do? Who do they come with? Do they come with a clergy person or other family support system? Or do they come by themselves? Are they appearing before the judge in an orange jumpsuit or prison attire as opposed to a suit and a tie? Many of the kind of conventional things that we think about in terms of what success and forward thinking people should look like. So the other piece of that is we have to be careful about the way we impose our own judgments around what people look like think like what their success paths might be like. But fines and fees are real. And North Carolina has several urban areas but it s also quite a rural state. And socioeconomic conditions are real in terms of how we think about the imposition of fines and even whether or not people have the ability to pay. And I think that probably also leads us to the bail bonds as well. David Levi Anyone else on this topic? Goodwin. Goodwin Liu I d like to add another example. In addition to fines and fees and what Chuck said about sentencing. A few years ago a case came to our court challenging the DNA Collection Act that exists in California which authorizes law enforcement to collect DNA immediately upon any felony arrest. This is an issue that is an echo of the Maryland versus King decision by the US Supreme Court a few years before the case in our court. The California law differed in a few ways from the Maryland law. Most notably it permitted this collection of DNA before any judicial determination or neutral determination that the arrest was valid and supported by probable cause. So even in the field or at booking the DNA can be collected. Now our court upheld this act on a 43 decision I was in the dissent. And I won t get into the legal points of the dissent because that s not really my point. My point is when you look at the statistics underlying who can have their DNA collected it turns out that in California about one in five felony arrests result in no prosecution and almost one in three results in no conviction of any kind. And so what that means is that the state right has authorized sort of overcollection in my view of people who are situated really no differently than an innocent citizen at the end of the day. And yet all of that DNA sits in a repository. And there are expungement provisions and the like but it turns out that the expungement is not automatic. And anybody who wants to get expunged has to fill out a form. Well anytime you require someone to kind of take a step like that it s going to be minimally utilized because people don t know how to do it they don t know how to access it. And quite honestly it s quite easy to do. But if you look at the actual rates at which expungement occurs it s very very low. And so what is the net effect of this? Well it turns out that African Americans are about 6 or 7 of the California population. They are about 20 of the felony arrestees in California. And of those African Americans who are arrested they are disproportionately released without prosecution or conviction. So what that means is that there is a disproportionate policing going on of this population as a result of such laws that basically then create almost like what I would argue is something like a surveillance mechanism. Which in a sense is also sort of a windfall for the state because as Chuck said about arrest histories and whatnot there are these disproportionate arrests and that they disproportionately arrest people who don t result in a prosecution or conviction. Right. So these are the kinds of ways I think that on the face facially neutral laws bake in a certain kind of systemic inequality that you can sort of quite tangibly track when you follow the numbers from the beginning to the end and then it s no accident that police like judges turn to where the information is and the disproportionate policing of certain communities has a sort of snowballing effect as a result. David Levi Ray or Chuck any thoughts on this interrelationship between the courts and other agencies of government and how the court s reputation for fairness which is so important can be affected. crosstalk 003717 Raymond Lohier Let me just say one thing very briefly which is I think that part of our jobs as judges is to educate the other branches legislators about the effects or the impact of certain laws statutes and so on. And that s of course another component of legislation that we should think about when we think about race and different people on both civil side and criminal side but particularly on the civil side having access to our courts around the country. We have a responsibility institutionally and sometimes as individual judges to educate our friends and others who are in the legislative business as well as these other law enforcement agencies frankly. Not just through our opinions but in other ways. Charles Breyer I m really mindful of the disparate impact that whatever we do as judges has on the communities that are before us. I think that there s a strong movement to reexamine the length of sentences. That a longer sentence doesn t necessarily result in a safer community. And there are a number of studies that demonstrate that. Nevertheless Congress has pointed to the fact that they ve enacted this legislation called the First Step Act. And the First Step Act among other things and it does some very good things by the way but I don t want to talk about those I want to talk about something else. It speaks to the issue of early release from sentences. And it says that we should take a look at risk assessments the Bureau of Prisons should and then those people who are less likely to recidivate should be released. So you d say Oh well that s a good idea. That s a fine idea. Let s take a look at that. And you see that the factors that are going to be considered are the ones that I said the last time education family support and so forth. So suddenly the First Step Act becomes what I call the White Collar Relief Act. And if you ve committed a white collar offense I promise you stand a much better chance of being released from prison than the person who has not. The drug offender the addict the person who doesn t have the family support. And who are those? Well they are the communities who are the disadvantaged communities. So then you might say All right so what? But the so what is so important because the so what is that when you see that white collar offenders are released minorities are not they have to serve the full sentence you understand how a certain degree of cynicism is furthered or nurtured. And this trust of the judicial system occurs as a result of what we do. And so I come more from the school of I understand justice is blindfolded. But you know you can take a peek and one of the peeks under that blindfold maybe what is it that you do? And what impact does it have on the community? Because I think we would all say as judges it s important to understand the disproportionate impact of whatever we do in terms of sentencing. It s crucial and it s crucial to the acceptance of justice as being an appropriate remedy or institution in administering our civil society. So I applaud what Ray has done. I think that he s absolutely right. David Levi Well we ve kind of talked about this already but maybe we can be as concrete as possible. What steps can judges take and courthouses take to assure minority community members and others that the courts poor people generally that the courts are attempting to be fair and equitable and that they hope well they can do better that they hope that they instill confidence in people in their desire for justice. What should judges be doing? Anyone? Raymond Lohier So let me just point out three things that I think are important but just steps as you point out. I don t know that there is a full panacea to fully ensure true widespread public confidence across communities of color and other communities in this country. But I do think that the diversity of judicial decision making that is judges makes a difference. Obviously at the federal level the executive is the appointing authority for Article III judges but there are magistrate judges there are bankruptcy judges. There are any number of members of the judicial staff in a courthouse in the clerk s office. Those are the people that the public will see in the first instance. And I think that at least hiring or appointing those people with an eye to diversity might help to enhance public confidence in the judiciary at the federal level and presumably also at the state level. I think that forms of civic education are critical. We have only just started in the last few years at the federal level to really engage in civic education to try to educate the public about what it is that the courts do. And perhaps just as importantly what it is that the courts don t do or can t do as a way of enhancing public confidence and understanding in the courts and about the courts. The third thing I would say as part of the civic education program is bringing people in and making it easier for people from different communities to come into the courthouses to see what we actually do and being a little bit more transparent about what we do. And I m not saying at the circuit level for example televising our voting conferences but letting it be known publicly that the courthouses courtrooms are public and people should come in and be able to see the business of the courts happening in real time. I think that all three of those things are helpful. I also think that we need to be a little bit careful about our language when it comes to race in particular in our opinions and in our speeches and write or say things with some sensitivity to the history of race along many different metrics in our country. Goodwin Liu That was well said I would add three things. One is I would underscore what Ray said about diversity in the judiciary itself and in the judicial branch. Our state bar actually this week just released a big report about the makeup of the profession here in California. And I think it s fair to say that the profession as a whole is a kind of lagging indicator of society because people have long careers and long tenures and the people who are lawyers today are not necessarily reflective of the society that is coming up behind them. And this applies doubly so for judges who have very long tenures and so we ll always be a little step behind. It also extends to who we hire inside the courts. As Ray knows Jeremy Fogel and I have been involved in an ongoing study of diversity in law clerk hiring which has been super interesting. He and I are interviewing 40 federal circuit judges to better understand what are some of the obstacles to getting more minority clerks into the highest rungs of the judiciary. There s been a basically flat line for Black Latino and even Asian law clerks despite the increasing numbers of those groups at the top schools over the past two decades. So understanding that is really important. I think secondly there is a very public facing role that judges can play and it s an uncomfortable one. Because I think judges are used to having a bit of separation from society I remember when I was first appointed to the bench. The joke of it was that I never got any phone calls anymore. And the email kind of dried up and I was sitting in my chambers wondering where did the world go? And I think the profession and your friends and the outside world respect that separation. But that just means that judges I think have to take the first step to extend the hand outward to say you know I m listening. I m interested I m engaged. I want to hear what people have to say. What Chuck said I want to hear about experience. I don t want to just sit and write you know in my chambers as if it were all an abstraction. Different judges have different sensibilities about this but I think we can all do more to have a slightly more public facing role to outreach especially to those communities that feel less wellserved and more unequally served by the justice system. And the third thing I d say is that I think judges do a very big role in agenda setting. And this goes back to something Ray said a second ago about education. You could sort of take the phrase if you see something say something into how we do things even in our judicial opinions. There are a lot of cases I m sure we encounter them every day where the law is what it is and there s not a whole lot we can do even when we see something unjust or misguided as a matter of policy. Well I don t think it s outside the judicial role at all to write a separate opinion or to write a paragraph that says You know what this may need to be reexamined because I ve just looked at a case right that has these facts. And I ve looked at the data that has these facts and this is how it has been playing out. And the relevant policymakers or in some cases the judges upstairs who write higher law than we do may need to take a second look at some of these things. I ll give you an example. I ve been very concerned about racial discrimination in jury selection for my entire time on the bench. I ve written more than I want to say about that issue. And I think finally actually that issue is getting some traction. In California there s legislation that s being proposed to rework the whole framework of how that discrimination is ferreted out. Our own court board appointed a jury selection work group to examine all phases of jury selection. So it takes time and persistence but I think judges have a very important role in setting the agenda. And we do see a lot so if we see something we should say something. Charles Breyer Can I just add to what Goodwin said. Yeah I think judges have a continuing responsibility to educate educate themselves and to educate the public that comes before them. We have since I ve been a judge a long time but in the beginning we did very little in terms of educating jurors about their task. It was a really sort of vanilla operation. Can you be fair can you administer justice fairly any reason why you can t sit on a jury? Now we have a video that incorporates a whole section on implicit bias with examples of implicit bias that a juror can see. And who knows does that work? What we think at least like Judge Chen who s led the effort in our court and other judges all across the country it tells a jury a juror be alert to these problems. Are you going to change a juror s mind? Are you going to change a judge s mind? I have no idea. Maybe and maybe not. But the problem is you ve got to alert them. People have to know judges have to know. We have to know we have to see the impact of what we do. And we have to factor in our experiences. So I would echo what my colleagues have said because I think that that is a hope for the future. David Levi Cheri many of the people that listen to this podcast and video will be lawyers and not judges. And I m wondering what would you ask them to do? Because so much of what can happen for the good will happen because members of the bar decide that they want to help the court. So what would you say to our friends in the bar as to what they can do for the courts? Cheri Beasley You know all of us as lawyers and as judges really are guardians of the rule of law and of our courts. And when we think about what happens in our courts we know what s happening. And so the people who come before the court they re told Go here do this fill this form out. And I m not sure that they always really understand why they re being asked to do what they re being asked to do what the consequences could possibly be around filling out forms. Often we don t have forms translated in languages other than English. And you know we re in the middle of a pandemic by the way which is also compounded by heightened racial tensions across this nation. And this is an amazing time for all of us to feel a sense of empowerment that even though we are faced with challenges all of us and certainly those that we serve this is an amazing opportunity for lawyers to lead. And in all the ways that we see that there are concerns and issues in our respective courts and courts across the nation. Lawyers certainly see the same kinds of things. And it does take courage to lead but if you think about every single difficult period in this nation s history lawyers have been at the foundation of fortifying change. I m excited about the opportunity for lawyers and for judges to think differently about where we are. I m excited about the opportunity to really provide access to justice and to make sure that people who come before our courts at least understand the process. It s hard to have justice and this elusive thing we call justice if people don t even understand what is happening to them when they come to our courts. And so it s incumbent upon all of us lawyers and judges to make sure that that happens whether it s through procedural fairness. And I also think that in the same way that Goodwin talked about making sure people see us outside of our courts in sort of nontraditional judicial roles. You know we ve just started a Faith and Justice Alliance in North Carolina. We ve been working on it for over a year but what an amazing time to have the intersection between faith and justice and law. We ve got places of worship of all denominations across the state and clergy working with lawyers to provide pro bono services for those who have civil unmet legal needs. So it s an exciting time to think differently about how we do our work. It s an exciting time to think about how lawyers and judges can partner with community groups around making sure that people are having their needs met. And I think often we think about justice happening inside of our courtrooms. If you think about the fact that in North Carolina one in five children is hungry that really is an access to justice issue. If you think about how we deal with delinquency in our court in our schools there are wonderful opportunities. And you all know that North Carolina was the last state in the nation to raise the age and so we re really excited also about our schooljustice partnerships to make sure that there are alternate ways to really support young people to think about why they might be misbehaving in school. Not to criminalize that behavior but to ask questions around hunger and instability and other kinds of conditions around home and community. I mean all of us have the capacity to do that. Does it take a stretch for us to think differently and frankly to think outside of our own circumstances? It does. But that s okay. I mean this is a really wonderful opportunity for us to challenge ourselves and to push ourselves to do that. David Levi Well I think you gave such a good closing there Cheri that everybody is nodding their head and they agree with it. As in so many ways it s a time of adversity but that also means it s a time of opportunity. Thank you all so so much for taking your precious time to talk with us today. We all share the goal of a justice system that is fair and equitable and accessible to all Americans. And we re so fortunate to have the four of you as leaders in our courts and to help us reach that goal and aspire to that goal. This is ongoing work. It will never be finished. Every generation will have to renew the struggle and this aspiration and I hope you will let us all know how we can help you in this important work.
