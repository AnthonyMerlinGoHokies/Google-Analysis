Largely considered a necessity at the local and county level to keep operations running these taxes most commonly deal with real estate. Though its everyones responsibility to pay their share of taxes there are legal methods people can use to reduce their tax liability. Property taxes and the associated assessment theyre based on are no exception.  If you re staring down an upcoming property assessment you ll want to ensure it s as accurate as possible. To that end we ve gathered some of the more common property tax exemptions that may apply to you.  Often considered the financial backbone of local government property taxes are generally levied by your municipality county government and often your local public school system. When collected they help pay for your communitys needs such as emergency services trash collection and public libraries to name a few.  Property taxes are whats called an ad valorem tax which is considered by some circles to be a regressive tax which means its based on the assessed value of a property. How much youll pay in property taxes will depend on several factors and varies among municipalities. Furthermore some municipalities may levy taxes on more than just real estate opting to include other tangible personal property such as vehicles or furniture.  In order to calculate how much a property owner must pay in property taxes the assessed value of the property in question must first be determined. Depending on where you live that value could be determined by having a tax assessor physically visit the property to determine its value though thats not always the case. Some jurisdictions assess properties based on their market value while other locations multiply the market value by an assessed rate to find the final assessed value.  Along with any exceptions which we will address below the tax bill for a property is dependent on the local property tax rate as well as the assessed value of the property. A property tax rate also known as a mill rate is multiplied by the final assessed value of the property in order to come to the property tax bill.  How often these assessments take place also depends on where you live. In many locations such as Arizona California and West Virginia tax assessments occur every year. However in many other states the frequency with which tax assessments take place can be as long as 10 years or entirely at the discretion of the municipality. You should make sure you know when your assessments will take place in order to properly seek certain exemptions.  No one wants to pay more in taxes than they should. If you believe that your property taxes are too high you can appeal your property tax bill. Typically you will have a predetermined amount of time after receiving your property assessment or tax bill for which you ll be able to argue that the assessor s determination was wrong.  Like nearly every other aspect of the property tax conversation the process by which you would go about appealing your property taxes varies from state to state county to county or even municipality to municipality. For example property owners in Marion County Oregon are required to file their appeals after receiving their tax statement but before Dec. 31. Meanwhile taxpayers in Wake County N.C. have 30 days after receiving their initial notice of value to appeal.  Keep in mind that you won t get an immediate response to your appeal. It will take time to fill out the appropriate paperwork and pay any associated fees in order to even begin explaining why you believe your property is actually worth less than the assessed value. Again what that process looks like will be determined by where you live. Even then it could take a while before you hear back from whichever agency handles your property assessments because they are likely slammed with other assessment appeals at the same time.  Property taxes can be a costly annual expense. Though a small reduction in your assessment could end up only saving you a few hundred dollars over the course of a year if you can successfully argue that your property was grossly overassessed you could easily end up keeping thousands of dollars in your pocket.  Though you can t argue the tax rate another way you can reduce your property taxes is by seeking and arguing for certain exemptions. Though certain exemptions such as those for religious or government organizations are out of reach for the average property owner the following exemptions could fit your needs and help reduce your property tax bill.  In many states home and property owners above a certain age can receive a property tax exemption. The specific details regarding the cutoff age and other eligibility requirements such as Social Security status may also play a part. Furthermore there may be some additional requirements or other criteria. This kind of exemption could be a lifesaver for many older adults because 5.8 million Americans ages 65 and older were living in poverty as recently as 2021.  For those who served our country in the military many states and municipalities offer property tax exemptions. Whether or not the exemption is available for just veterans with disabilities or for anyone who served in the armed forces depends on the state. How much this exemption can deduct from your overall property tax bill also depends on where you live. For example California offered a basic exemption amount of 134706 in 2018. Other states offer to completely eliminate property taxes for disabled veterans.  If you have a primary residence and want to reduce the overall property tax bill associated with that residence you may be able to apply for a homestead property tax exemption. Depending on where you live you may not even have to fall within a certain subset of citizens to be eligible because some states actually offer the exemption to every homeowner. However most states often require that you be  Some homestead exemptions are based on a flat value reduction of all of the taxable value of your home. Other instances of the homestead property tax exemption are calculated by a percentage. In the former structure lowervalued homes receive a larger reduction while the latter is a better choice for people with highvalue properties.  Though most renovations can increase your property taxes thanks to their higher valuation some states offer exemptions for renovations up to a certain dollar amount. Depending on where your property is located some parts of the country offer to waive property taxes for up to a certain amount of home improvements. In these instances local governments will set the limit on how much money you can put into a property before you return to paying the full tax amount.  If youre looking to add to the global push for more green energy and less waste you may be able to take advantage of some additional property tax discounts. Installing items like solar panels on your roof could not only lower your energy bill but also earn you a property tax incentive in the process. In some cases this is done by reducing your property assessment by the value of whatever improvements you added to the home. Though solar panels are typically a more common method of generating renewable energy throughout the country some states may also provide exemptions for geothermal heat pumps and wind power.  To see whether your state and municipality offer such an exemption you can search for any potential benefits on the Database of State Incentives for Renewables Efficiency.  Homeowners living with a disability are likely to be eligible for a property tax exemption. How much relief your disability will garner you when it comes to property taxes depends on where you live. In some cases you ll have to provide a legal affidavit to explain your disability. Still if you re having a hard time moving around and are living on a single fixed income a reduction in your property taxes could be a significant financial help. National Association of Counties.

Like their counterparts in other states lawmakers in Colorado aim to craft longterm legislation this year providing relief from skyrocketing property taxes. Thomas PeipertThe Associated Press Soaring home values have increased property taxes for millions of homeowners in recent years prompting action from state lawmakers to lighten the burden.  The biggest problem was they just went up so quickly. I think that s one of the reasons why it became this rallying cry from the people asking for tax relief said Idaho state Rep. Jason Monks a Republican. The typical home value in Idaho increased from 275852 in November 2019 to 434224 this November a 57 increase over four years according to data provided by real estate giant Zillow which tracks the average of the middle onethird of home values. Rising home prices typically lead to higher property tax assessments potentially pushing up tax bills even when tax rates remain steady. Those rates are generally set by local governments not legislatures. But public pressure has compelled lawmakers in several states including Idaho to use surplus state revenues to mitigate property tax hikes. In Ada County home to Boise and Idaho s most populous county the measure that Monks and his colleagues approved in March delivered nearly 100 million in property tax relief. That amounted to a median cut of more than 500 per home the Idaho Capital Sun reported.  I think it was wildly successful Monks said. Really everybody across the state received tax relief which was the objective of the bill.  Blue and red states slash taxes despite warnings of hard times ahead  Jared Walczak vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation a probusiness research organization said he expects many other states both blue and red to tackle the issue this year.  In virtually every state where the legislature meets this year property tax relief bills will be filed Walczak said. This is a frontofmind issue for many legislators across the country.  States can set broad property tax policies such as tinkering with assessment rates on real estate. But it s generally local governments including school districts and municipalities that set specific tax rates and heavily rely on the revenue for daytoday operations. The effort across the country to provide property tax relief has sparked some concern that states could go too far jeopardizing revenue for school districts and local governments. And some policymakers worry about overly broad relief that could benefit the wealthiest property owners at the expense of those most in need. In Idaho legislators had to override a veto from Republican Gov. Brad Little who was worried about jeopardizing funding for transportation projects and the cutting of a local election date. After the veto override the governor said he was satisfied with legislative cleanups and overall was supportive of the property tax changes. The issue is particularly ripe in the Mountain West where home values skyrocketed after remote work gave Americans more residential freedom. Many wellheeled workers fled the East Coast and California for the mountains pushing up housing prices. In virtually every state where the legislature meets this year property tax relief bills will be filed. This is a frontofmind issue for many legislators across the country.  Jared Walczak vice president of state projects at the Tax Foundation In December Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte launched a task force charged with proposing a property tax relief plan for legislators to consider at their next regular session in 2025. Recent legislation authorized up to 675 in property tax rebates for 2023 and 2024 but Gianforte said the state needs longterm reforms to keep property taxes as low as possible.  In Wyoming organizers aim to put a property tax relief measure on the statewide ballot after legislative efforts fizzled. Lawmakers already have introduced several alternative measures ahead of the 2024 session. And Colorado lawmakers will once again attempt to deliver lasting property tax relief after the failure of a ballot initiative pushed by Democratic Gov. Jared Polis prompted a shortterm legislative cut during a special session in November. Nebraska Republican Gov. Jim Pillen has proposed to reduce local property taxes by increasing the state sales tax rate by 2 cents from 5.5 cents to 7.5 cents the Nebraska Examiner reported. Generally American home values increase incrementally each year. The CaseShiller U.S. National Home Price Index a benchmark of average singlefamily home prices shows a steady increase from the 1980s to the beginning of 2020. But those values shot up nearly 40 over the past three years far outpacing inflation rates for food energy and other consumer purchases.   So they homeowners could be facing 40 higher property taxes. Even after you account for inflation this is a very significant increase Walczak of the Tax Foundation said. And they recognize they re not getting 40 more or better government for these additional tax payments. So there is a public outcry.  That outcry is especially pronounced among retired and lowincome homeowners who often struggle to keep up with rising property taxes.  I think the main reason people get frustrated with property taxes is that they re often disconnected from their ability to pay said Aidan Davis the state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy a research group that supports tax policies to create a racially and economically equitable tax system.  As with the recent wave of state income tax cuts it s unclear whether deep property tax cuts can be sustained over time as state revenues likely begin to decline. Nearly every state has enacted some form of property tax limit since the 1970s. Some implemented caps on how much valuations of a home can rise each year. Other states have pushed local jurisdictions to restrict rate increases. I think the main reason people get frustrated with property taxes is that they re often disconnected from their ability to pay.  Aidan Davis state policy director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy But Davis said acrosstheboard cuts don t necessarily provide relief to those most in need. Her organization recommends lawmakers consider socalled circuit breakers which prevent homeowners and renters from being overloaded by property taxes. While programs vary greatly 29 states and the District of Columbia have enacted circuit breakers that cap property tax bills if they represent too large a share of a homeowner s income. Property taxes are generally more regressive than other taxes Davis said meaning they take a larger percentage of income from lowerincome residents. But circuit breakers can protect people whose home values have surged even if their incomes haven t. Idaho lawmakers last year diverted state surplus revenues to fund property tax relief sending cash directly to local school systems to make up for lost property taxes. The legislation also increased the income limit and assessed valuation cap for residents participating in the state s circuit breaker program allowing more older widowed or disabled homeowners to qualify. Homeowners saw an average property tax cut of 18 late last year according to the governor s office. Black Homeowners Pay More Than Fair Share in Property Taxes  To dissuade local school systems from raising taxes the legislation cut the most popular of four annual election dates that schools largely had relied on to ask voters to raise revenues. That was a key reason the law was opposed by the Idaho School Boards Association. Idaho school systems rely on local levies to fund not only facility costs but also operational expenses such as teacher salaries athletics and special education said Quinn Perry the association s director of policy and government affairs. While lawmakers touted the law as a historic state investment in education Perry noted that the state simply swapped school funding sources. And it s unclear how sustainable the tax cut will prove over time as pandemic relief dries up and the economy remains uncertain. In October Idaho budget officials announced state revenues came in nearly 40 million below projected levels as sales and income taxes were weaker than expected.  I think there is a good question about sustainability Perry said because it s essentially taking a lot of general fund dollars to pay for home relief.  Texas voters in November overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment under which the state will send 7.1 billion to school districts so they can lower property taxes. The amendment which passed with 80 support also doubles the homestead exemption and caps property tax increases on certain business properties. At 18 billion Texas delivered the nation s largestever property tax cut said state Sen. Paul Bettencourt who worked on the plan with fellow Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick. But he said it also helped those struggling the most The homestead exemption means homeowners won t have to pay taxes on the first 100000 value of their homes a provision that will mean the most to those at the lower end of the market.  It s good tax policy but it s also good public policy to keep people in their homes Bettencourt said. And quite frankly I think it s a moral responsibility. Because with all the pressures in modern society you want to keep as many families as possible in their own home.  In Colorado the landscape ranges from rural ranching communities to booming urban and suburban markets. And property taxes can prove a doubleedged sword a wealthy homeowner or investor could cash in on a home value that has doubled in just a few years time. But a cashstrapped or lowincome homeowner could be at risk of losing their house over skyrocketing valuations and taxes. Property Taxes Sink Farmland Owners   I ve been struggling with this said Democratic state Rep. Marc Snyder. It s really hard to come up with a statewide solution when you have such a variety of situations in Colorado.  Lawmakers grappled with the issue after the November failure of Proposition HH which would have reduced property tax rates over 10 years and exempted part of a home s value for its assessment. In a fourday special session that month the Democraticcontrolled legislature provided about 430 million in property tax relief but only for 2023.  It worked for a shortterm solution said Democratic state Rep. Chris deGruy Kennedy. Kennedy is a member of a task force that began studying the issue in December. That group also includes representatives of local governments. He says many of those leaders want the state to stay away from the issue of property tax rates.  The state doesn t get any property tax revenue so why should it decide how much money the local governments collect? he said. And I think that s a pretty persuasive argument.  Kennedy said he wants to ensure that Colorado s school and fire districts have the revenue sources they need to operate well. But he s wary of tax relief that is overly broad.  I want to make sure that whatever we do to provide property tax or rent assistance is done in the most targeted way possible he said so that we re actually giving the dollars to the people that need them rather than doing acrosstheboard cuts.  The task force aims to report its recommendations to the legislature in March. That should give lawmakers time to craft legislation before the session ends in May said Snyder who is running for a state Senate seat.  I would not relish the thought of going out and knocking on doors if we haven t done anything he said. by Kevin Hardy Stateline January 4 2024 by Kevin Hardy Stateline January 4 2024 Soaring home values have increased property taxes for millions of homeowners in recent years prompting action from state lawmakers to lighten the burden.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/comparables.asp,  Comparables are important to pricing decisions in many industries but are essential in real estate. They are an important factor in determining the fair value of a home based on prices achieved for homes of similar size condition and amenities in the same neighborhood.  Most lists of comparables are drawn from sales in the previous year.   Using comparables requires comparing the characteristics of a recently sold asset with the characteristics of a similar asset that is being valued. When using comparables it is important to compare assets that are as similar as possible in their characteristics such as location size age condition and other relevant factors. The more similar the assets are the more reliable the resulting valuation will be.  When done properly attention is paid to details that add or detract from the value of similar properties such as distance from good public schools or a particularly attractive patio.  The value of the comparable asset is then used as a benchmark or reference point for valuing the similar asset. A minimum of three comparables must be considered in the sales comparison approach.  Comparables are used by investors financial analysts and appraisers in many businesses.  Stock analysts and investors use them to help determine the value of a company s shares based on the prices of its competitors in the same industry. They may be used to identify companies that are significantly undervalued or overvalued in comparison to their peers.  Comparables are commonly used in commercial real estate to determine the profit likely to be realized by renting or selling space.  They also are a valuable resource for introducing any new product to the marketplace. A new product must be competitive in price with similar existing products. If it s higher in price the premium must be justified by its superior qualities.  When considering the price of a home start by looking at recent sales nearby that are similar in size age and features. Current listings are also of interest.  Realtor.com lists recent home sales in a database that is searchable by zip code. The images descriptions and property details are viewable in the result.  Other resources include local real estate agents and the county assessor s office. Real estate agents have access to a wide range of information about properties sold and for sale in the area and can help you identify comparable properties. The county assessor s office keeps records of recent sales and can provide you with information about the prices that similar properties have sold for in the past.  Online real estate websites such as Zillow and Redfin also can be searched for comps. Some have tools that allow you to filter your search by location price and other factors.  Once you have a list of potential comps you can compare them to the property in question to determine its value. In any business comps are usually limited to sales over the previous year. Market conditions can change rapidly and comparables that are older can be misleading.  Comparables are a must if youre considering a for sale by owner FSBO. Realtors have the resources and expertise to accurately judge the value of a home. Comparables can help sellers who avoid hiring a realtor to start the process with a reasonable price.  When looking at comps consider listings that are most similar to your property s location size age and condition. Location is always important. Look for properties that have similar characteristics such as the number of bedrooms and bathrooms type of heating and cooling system and special features such as a pool or a deck. Look for extras and upgrades that add value to the property. By comparing properties with similar characteristics you can get a more accurate estimate of the property s value.  The more comparables you look at the more accurate your home s asking price will be.  Even the best comparables can t tell you everything. You can get a more precise assessment by driving past the home or viewing it on Google Maps Street View.  That will give you plenty of information about the attractiveness of the street the walkability of the neighborhood and its proximity to amenities that are important to you. You might also discover big negatives like a gas station next to the house.  For example Bert wants to sell his house. He notices that a similar house in the neighborhood has just recently sold. He does a little investigating and finds the price that it was sold for. He now has an idea of how much his property is worth.  He enlists the help of Steve who is a realtor. After taking a walkthrough of the house Steve pulls comparables for the last 12 months for houses similar to Bert s in his neighborhood. These comparables are used to determine the list price for Bert s house. Bad comparables lead to big errors in pricing real estate. Avoid basing your price on the following Trading comparables is a method of valuing a company by comparing it to similar companies that have recently been sold or are currently on the market. This method is often used in the field of mergers and acquisitions to determine the fair market value of a company. Banking comparables is a method of evaluating the financial performance of a bank by comparing it to similar banks. This method is often used by investors and analysts to assess a bank s financial health and stability. The comparison helps identify trends and patterns in the bank s performance and determine how well it is doing in relation to its peers.  The use of comparables helps to put an accurate price tag on an asset whether it is a home for sale or a company s stock. It involves finding the closest possible matches to the asset being valued and adjusting for variables that make it more or less valuable than its peers.
https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/understanding-impact-property-taxes-critical-effective-local-policymaking, Property taxes are the financial backbone of local governments. They account for nearly threequarters of local tax collections and are a significant local revenue source for financing K 12 education police and fire departments parks and other services. Property taxes also shape local housing markets by influencing the costs of buying renting or investing in homes and apartment buildings. Understanding how changes in property taxes affect households and community development therefore allows local jurisdictions to more effectively design their tax systems. The best way to understand the impact of any existing or proposed property tax initiative is to examine the propertylevel impacts in a community. But this is hard to do because every county reports propertylevel tax payments data differently and it is difficult to accurately identify owneroccupied properties. At a recent Urban Institute event two researchers shared how they tackled these challenges in their work with property records data. Their case studies shed light on the interplay between property taxes housing supply and residential mobility.  In 1978 California passed Proposition 13 which reduced property taxes by locking local property assessments to 1975 market value levels or the most recent purchase price and by restricting increases on assessments to no more than 2 percent each year. This has significantly restricted an important source of tax revenue for local governments as property values have increased considerably over the past decades while property tax increases have been severely limited. The proposed tax ballot Proposition 15 creates a splitroll property tax system in which residential property and commercial property would be assessed and taxed under different regimes. Commercial property would be reassessed to market price every three years while residential property would continue to be taxed under the rules of Proposition 13. Sarah Strochak a research analyst in the Urban Institute s Housing Finance Policy Center and her coauthors examined whether converting to this splitroll system would create incentives that would increase or decrease housing supply in California. Using First American property records data in California they combined information on property taxes assessment values and zoning codes. Because zoning codes are not standardized across jurisdictions the authors also selected four case study cities Berkeley Chula Vista Fresno and Los Angeles to represent different types of communities. They found that very few parcels are viable for conversion from residential use to industrial or commercial use while many parcels are eligible to be converted from commercial or industrial use to residential use. Their analysis showed that longterm incentives for owners and developers to buildconvert to residential uses are much stronger than for municipalities to rezone under medium and high price appreciation scenarios.  On balance splitroll tax reforms are more likely to increase the housing supply in California than constrain it. But it is unlikely that the reform will solve California s extreme housing shortage or affordability challenges without additional policies and reforms. Gentrification when a large group of highincome households moves into a previously lowincome neighborhood can displace financially vulnerable longterm homeowners. As highincome households move into a neighborhood home values and property taxes often rise. Lei Ding senior economic adviser at the Federal Research Bank of Philadelphia and his coauthor used property tax records to determine whether a 2014 property tax overhaul the Actual Value Initiative caused existing homeowners in gentrifying neighborhoods to move out of their neighborhood. The researchers used property records data to gather information on property owner occupancy status property assessment and tax payment history including tax abatements and exemptions. Ding and his coauthor found that gentrification increases property values property taxes and the delinquency risk on property tax bills. But there has been no sign five years later of displacement among elderly and financially disadvantaged homeowners which the researchers attributed to protections offered by welltargeted gentrification tax relief programs in Philadelphia. Despite the challenges of working with propertylevel tax records researchers can use these records to learn how well local taxes achieve various policy goals. With careful analysis these records can help policymakers more effectively design their tax systems.

https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/critics-argue-property-tax-unfair-do-they-have-point, Last month an Idaho lawmaker called the property tax inherently evil and suggested the state repeal it and replace the foregone revenue with a higher sales tax. He described the property tax in feudal terms saying it dates back to the dark ages or the middle ages when the lords of the manor had to pay taxes to the Kings and the Queens otherwise they didnt get to keep their land.  This caught my attention because I m a nerdy tax economist and we are known for loving property taxes while the general public well doesn t. So my first pedantic reaction was to tweet that actually the property tax dates to 6000 B.C. And it performs very well on criteria of sound taxation like efficiency equity and reliability. But because proposals to eliminate or substantially reduce the property tax resurface every few years similar plans have been floated in Nebraska Pennsylvania and Texas and enacted in South Carolina I decided to revisit some of the property tax haters best arguments through the prism of some of my favorite more nuanced resources. The takeaway although a good tax the property tax has some troublesome features. These flaws are hardly deal breakers but they do knock the property tax off its pedestal. Politicians commissions property owners and advocates should keep them in mind when embarking on reforms. The first goal of the property tax is to generate revenue for local governments to do stufflike providing schools roads parks and police protection. It does that very well generating about threequarters of local taxes and half of all local government revenue excluding state and federal aid. But that s only one goal of tax policy. Another is equity and this is where the property tax gets tricky. The fairness of the property tax depends on what kind of tax you think it is. Is it a tax on consumption your cost of living in a house? If so the tax is regressive because housing costs take a bigger bite out of lowincome household budgets. Especially if the property tax gets passed on to renters as well as burdening homeowners we also need to consider what counts as income. Are students or seniors with low current earnings but higher lifetime incomes really poor ? Or is the property tax a tax on capital your return to owning a house? This kind of tax would be progressive on average because capital owners tend to be wealthier but places with higherthanaverage property tax rates may see these higher taxes reflected in lower land prices or reduced wages and that would dampen progressivity. What about the entry fee theory that says the property tax is the price of admission for living in a community and consuming all those services like K12 education and police protection the local government provides?  Progressivity is complicated here too. Lowincome families with lots of kids consume more in government services such as K12 education than they pay in taxes. Yet a highquality K12 education system benefits many others besides students including employers and by increasing property values higherincome homeowners. Note analysts don t typically talk about the progressivity or regressivity of taxes based on the services those tax dollars buy but maybe we should. The property tax may also expose homeowners to too much uncertainty. If a big box retail establishment closes in their area or opens in a neighboring one homeowners may see tax bills rise as the local government tries to make up lost revenue caused by a reduction in the commercial tax base. To alleviate this concern and avoid more drastic property tax limitations Tulane s Steve Sheffrin has suggested taxing owners based on ranges or bands rather than specific levels of property value an approach used by the UK. Greater transparency including explanations of how property tax bills are calculated and how homeowners can apply for property tax relief may also help improve the tax and increase its acceptability.  Speaking of transparency journalists at Syracuse.com and Propublica have found significant inequities in property taxes due to delayed reappraisals and the greater chances of assessments being successfully appealed in fast appreciating middle and highincome neighborhoods compared to lowincome ones. Against a backdrop of persistent racial wealth gaps these results are extremely troubling. In sum the property tax is a stable adequate and reliable revenue source but it also raises equity and transparency concerns. Unfortunately Idaho s Rep. Monks proposal to ban the property tax and hike the state sales tax rate to 11 percent by far the highest in the nation to offset revenue losses would double down on regressivity sales taxes are regressive because lowincome households spend a greater proportion of their budgets on consumption and on goods which are taxed rather than services which are not. Monks describes his proposal as a discussion starter and I appreciate the food for thought. Now we need to think realistically about how to pay for the government we want.

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/pf/07/property_tax_tips.asp,  It s important to know how your municipality calculates your property taxes. Two neighboring towns may calculate them differently which can be confusing for residents.  Property taxes are computed using two very important figures the tax rate and the current market value of your property. A municipality sets its specific tax rate also known as millage or mill rate based on how much money it needs to pay for important services. State law determines how often the rate can be changed. Some states allow them to be altered annually while others do so in different increments such as every five years.  An assessor hired by the local government estimates your property s market value including the land and structures. Then you receive an assessment. In some jurisdictions the assessed value is a percentage of the market value in others it is the same as the market value.  The assessor may visit your property or complete property assessments remotely using software with updated tax rolls. Next based on this assessment your local tax collector s office sends you your property tax bill.  To prepare your tax bill your tax office multiplies the tax rate by the assessed value. So if your property is assessed at 300000 and your local government sets your tax rate at 2.5 your annual tax bill is 7500. Property tax revenue is used to fund local projects and services such as fire departments law enforcement local public recreation and education. Although these services benefit all residents property taxes can be quite burdensome for some homeowners. Some states have more favorable property tax rates than others.  Few homeowners realize they can go down to the town or city hall and request a copy of their property tax cards from the local assessor s office. Many of these are now online. The tax card provides the homeowner with information the town has gathered about their property over time.  This card includes information about the lot s size the rooms precise dimensions and the number and type of fixtures within the home. Other information included may be special features or any improvements to the existing structure.  As you review this card note any discrepancies and raise these issues with the tax assessor. The assessor will either correct or conduct a reevaluation. Though you might not think so mistakes are common. If you find them the township or city must correct them.  Any structural changes to a home or property will increase your tax bill. A deck a pool a large shed or any other permanent fixture added to your home is presumed to increase its value.  Homeowners should investigate how much a new addition could increase their property tax bill before they begin construction. Call the local building and tax departments. They ll be able to give you a ballpark estimate of any changes. Investopedias Tax Savings Guide can help you maximize your tax credits deductions and savings. Order yours today.  Tax assessors are given a strict set of guidelines for their evaluations. However the assessment still contains a certain amount of subjectivity. This means that more attractive homes often receive a higher assessed value than comparable houses that are less physically appealing.  Your property is compared with your neighbors and others in the general vicinity during the evaluation. While it may be difficult resist the urge to primp your property before the assessor s arrival. You should be able to plan because the assessor normally schedules a visit in advance.  Make any physical improvements or cosmetic alterations to the home after the assessor finishes the evaluation.  Information about your home is available at the local town or city hall. Frequently information about other home assessments in the area is also available.  It is important to review comparable homes in the area and general statistics about the towns evaluation results. You may find discrepancies that could lower your taxes.  For example let s say you have a fourbedroom home with a onecar garage and your home is assessed at 250000. Your neighbor also owns a fourbedroom home but this house sports a twocar garage a 150squarefoot shed and a beautiful swimming pool. Despite this your neighbor s home is valued at 235000.  Was there a mistake? Unless your property has some other distinguishing characteristics that explain the discrepancy the assessor probably made an error. If you find an error it pays to bring it to the assessor s attention as soon as possible so you can get a reassessment.  You do not have to bring the tax assessor into your home. However if you don t the assessor may assume that you ve made certain improvements to the interior such as new fixtures or expensive refurbishments. This could result in a bigger tax bill.  Many municipalities have a policy that if the homeowner does not grant full access to the property the assessor will automatically assign the highest assessed value possible for that type of property fair or not. At this point it s up to the individual to dispute the evaluation which will be nearly impossible unless you grant access to the interior.  The lesson allow the assessor to access your home. If you took out permits for all improvements that youve made to the property the work you did shouldnt be a problem.  Many people allow the tax assessor to wander their homes unguided during the evaluation. This can be a mistake. Some assessors may only see the best parts of the home such as the new fireplace or marbletopped counters in the kitchen. They may overlook the fact that several appliances are out of date or that cracks are visible in the ceiling.  To prevent this be sure to walk the home with the assessor and point out the good points and deficiencies. This can help ensure you receive the fairest possible valuation for your home.  You may qualify for an exemption if you fall into certain categories. Here are some demographic groups and property types for which states and municipalities might lower the tax burden  Check with your taxing authority to see if you qualify for an exemption and then apply for it.  If you believe your bill should be lower but haven t gotten your tax assessment office to see things your way don t fret. You still have an option available appeal it.  If you decide to appeal do so promptly otherwise you ll be stuck with the bill you receive from your local tax office.  Filing a tax appeal will probably cost you a small filing fee which is paid to have someone review your appeal. Also the tax appeal generally requires the help of a lawyer. Your attorney will charge you a fee sometimes a part of your savings if your appeal is approved.  Your lawyer will review the steps of the appeal and what information is required. In some cases you may need to take photos and provide details on the current condition of your property. The board will then review this information compare it with the most recent assessment and tax bill and decide. You may hear about it instantly or a decision could take a few months.  If the board approves your appeal it will only lower your homes assessment value not your effective tax rate. Thats enough to lower your tax bill. Remember though that the appeal does not guarantee that your bill will drop. It may remain the same or in rare cases may increase if the reviewer feels your assessment is too low. You ll owe property taxes as long as you own a home. However state programs can provide certain individuals such as older adults with property tax relief if they meet the criteria. Check with your state or municipality for more information. It s an exemption that reduces your property s assessment value and therefore your property tax bill. It applies only to a primary residence. If you think it s incorrect contact your local tax authority immediately with the reasons for your belief. With that information office personnel can then doublecheck on your property s assessed value any applicable exemptions that weren t accounted for and that the correct tax rate and calculation were used.  It can be hard to balance the desire for a beautiful home with the desire to pay as little tax as possible. However there are some things you can do to reduce your property tax burden without resorting to living in only the lowestvalue homes.  Avoid making any improvements right before your house is because of be assessed. Check out the neighbors if they pay less tax than you but own a similar home you may be in line for a tax reduction.  The most important thing to remember is don t assume tax bills are always correct. A little homework and due diligence can help reduce and make more manageable what can be a distinct tax burden for certain homeowners. Department of RevenueMason CountyWashington State.

A homestead exemption minimizes property taxes for homeowners. Its also a legal provision offered in most states that helps shield a home from some creditors following the death of a homeowners spouse or the declaration of bankruptcy. The homestead tax exemption can provide surviving spouses with ongoing property tax relief on a graduated scale so homes with lower assessed values benefit the most.  The homestead exemption is helpful because its designed to provide both physical shelter and financial protection. This can block the forced sale of a primary residence. However the homestead exemption doesnt prevent or stop a bank foreclosure if the homeowner defaults on their mortgage.  You may be able to apply for a homestead property tax exemption if you have a primary residence and want to reduce the overall property tax bill associated with that residence. Depending on where you live you may not even have to fall within a certain subset of citizens to be eligible. Some states offer the exemption to every homeowner. However most states often require that you be  Some homestead exemptions are based on a flat reduction of all of the taxable value of your home. Other homestead property tax exemptions are calculated by a percentage. Lowervalued homes receive a larger reduction using the first method. The latter is a better choice for people with highvalue properties.  A version of the homestead exemption provision is found in every state or territory with some exceptions such as New Jersey and Pennsylvania. But how the exemption is applied and how much protection it affords against creditors varies by state. The homestead exemption is an automatic benefit in some states but homeowners must file a claim with the state to receive it in others.  A homestead property is considered to be a person s primary residence so no exemptions can be claimed on other owned property even residences. A surviving spouse must refile for the exemption if they move their primary residence. The homestead tax exemption helps to shield a portion of a home s value from property taxes. Homeowners may have to apply for the benefit and should check with their local government on how to do so.  The exemptions for homestead properties vary from state to state. A few states including Florida and Texas afford unlimited financial protection against unsecured creditors for the home although acreage limits may apply for the protected property. A limit for protection from creditors can range from 5000 to 500000 depending on the state. Many states fall into the 30000 to 50000 range.  The protection limits are not for the value of the home but are for the homeowners equity in it the value of the property minus the balance of the mortgage and other financial claims on the property. A homeowner cant be forced to sell the property to benefit creditors if the equity held is less than the limit but creditors may force the sale If a homesteads equity exceeds the limits. The homesteader may be allowed to keep a portion of the proceeds however.  Protection for the homestead property doesnt apply to secured creditors such as the bank that holds the mortgage on the home. The homeowner is protected only from unsecured creditors who may come after the homes value to satisfy claims against the homeowners assets.  Federal bankruptcy law shields a home from sale if the owner s equity does not exceed 25150 if the bankruptcy case was filed after April 1 2019. The exemption is 23675 for cases filed before that time.  Homeowners are forced to use the state limits in most states but they re often more favorable anyway. About one in three states allows a homeowner to use either the federal or applicable state limit.  Those who declare bankruptcy in New Jersey or Pennsylvania can get protection using the federal limits despite the absence of a state homestead exemption in these states. But bankruptcy protection only protects against unsecured creditors. It won t prevent a bank that holds a mortgage from foreclosing on the home.  A homestead tax or property tax is typically applied to homes based on the assessed value of the property by the local government tax assessor s office. The homestead tax can be a percentage of the property s value or a fixed amount.  The exemption may offer ongoing reductions in property taxes depending on state laws. These exemptions can help surviving spouses remain in their homes after their income has been reduced by the death of their partner.  Homestead tax exemptions usually offer a fixed discount on taxes such as exempting the first 50000 of the assessed value with the remainder taxed at the normal rate. Using an example of a 50000 homestead exemption a home valued at 150000 would be taxed on only 100000 of assessed value. A home valued at 75000 would then be taxed on only 25000.  Fixed homestead tax exemptions essentially turn a property tax into a progressive tax thats more favorable for those with more modest homes. The exemption is paid for with a local or state sales tax in some areas. Homeowners must occupy the property as their permanent residence to qualify for a homestead exemption. These exemptions can t be claimed for any other property that may be located elsewhere.  Let s say the assessed value of your home is 300000 and your property tax rate is 1. Your property tax bill would equal 3000. But the taxable value of your home would drop to 250000 if you were eligible for a homestead tax exemption of 50000 so your tax bill would drop to 2500. Eligibility for the homestead exemption varies by state. You ll typically be eligible if your income is low you re a senior you have a disability or you re a veteran. Exemptions can be combined if you fall into more than one category. There may also be a limit on the value of a home that can qualify for an exemption. Check with your local tax assessor. Go directly to your county or local tax assessor s website for details on available homestead tax exemptions. Some states require that you fill out an application but they re often available online. Make sure you comply with your state s application deadlines. Be aware that some sites may be fraudulent and may request payment to fill out an application for you. Your county or local tax assessor will not require you to pay a fee to fill out an application for a homestead tax exemption. Most states have homestead exemptions. New Jersey and Pennsylvania do not but Massachusetts and Rhode Island have set their exemption limits at 500000. Some states have general homestead laws instead such as provisions that protect surviving spouses from creditors. Individuals in Florida must have occupied the property as their permanent residence before Jan. 1 of the year for which they re applying. An applicant must be a Florida resident and a U.S. citizen or a permanent U.S. resident. Applicants can t claim or receive any type of tax exemption on any other property in the United States. An exemption application must be completed and submitted to the property appraiser in the county where the property is located by the statutory deadline of March 1. The homestead exemption in Florida provides a tax exemption of up to 50000. The first 25000 applies to all property taxes including school district taxes. An additional exemption of up to 25000 applies to the assessed value over 50000 but only to nonschool taxes.  The homestead exemption provides an exemption from property taxes on a home. The exemption also protects the value of residents homes from property taxes creditors and circumstances that arise from the death of the homeowner s spouse. A homestead exemption ensures that a surviving spouse has shelter.  The exemption only applies to a primary residence and can t be claimed for another property elsewhere. Homestead protection is automatic in some states but homeowners must file a claim for a homestead exemption in others. World Population Review. Homestead Exemptions by State 2023.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/property-taxes-homeowners-facing-new-property-assessments/,  By Aimee Picchi   May 20 2022 809 AM EDT MoneyWatch  Her property taxes jumped to about 12000 a year up from 10000 a bump she said is adding to the financial strain as inflation pushes up the cost of food and other necessities. While Van Donsel appealed the assessment she was given only a small reduction in the value of her home which didnt make a dent in her new tax bill. I hadnt planned on spending thousands of dollars more on property taxes for the year said Van Donsel 59 a state employee.  Such predicaments are the flip side of the surge in residential real estate prices as county and city officials blast out out new property assessments to homeowners across the U.S. The housing market surged during the pandemic sending the value of the typical U.S. home surging to 344000 or 37 higher than in February 2020 prior to the crisis.  Now higher property taxes could add to the cost burden of both longstanding and new home owners further crimping budgets at a time when inflation is at a 40year high. Cities and counties typically reassess property values every year or two although some regions have gaps of several years between reassessments. That means homeowners are just now seeing the real estate boom reflected in their tax bills. Some homeowners are now getting sticker shock when they receive new property assessments according to John Whitehead the property assessor of Knox County in Tennessee which in April sent out new property assessments to its residents its first in five years. Values in the county which is home to the city of Knoxville rose by an average of 40 in the new assessment. We had about 10000 appeals out of about 210000 property parcels after the county sent out its new appraisals he added. A lot of them their complaint was that it went up too much some went up 50 some 100 or more and the complaint was it just went up too much at one time and I understand that. Its the sticker shock. Average property tax payments hit record highs last year in some counties according to an April report by Attom Data Solutions a real estate data firm. Even so property taxes have lagged home prices with the former rising less than 2 last year while singlefamily home values jumped 16 Attom said. That means property taxes could soon reflect the higher home valuations according to the firm.  Some major cities and counties are now sending out new assessments to the dismay of some homeowners. In Philadelphia for example residential values are now 31 higher than during the citys last assessment three years ago Milwaukee has seen an average increase of 18 while in Knox County home values are up 40. That could impact budgets for longstanding homeowners as well as the millions of firsttime buyers who snapped up property during the pandemic. It also could be an unexpected cost for current house hunters who are facing higher home prices as well as mortgage costs which means the typical mortgage payment is more than 50 higher than a year ago. Its important to note that a higher assessment doesnt necessarily mean a bigger tax bill said Richard ODonnell of ODonnell Cullen Property Tax Consultants. A former tax assessor in Westchester County New York ODonnell explained that the issue is whether your assessment on a percentage basis rose more than the town or countys average increase.  A homeowner in Knox County whose home rose 50 in value would end up with a bigger tax bill because their home outpaced the countys average 40 increase Whitehead noted. Someone whose home rose less than 40 in value would see a reduction in their property taxes.  New assessments are typically designed to be revenueneutral meaning that the city or county cant gain revenue through an assessment experts say. For instance the new assessments impact taxes if a neighborhood appreciates faster than the city overall. In that case homeowners in that neighborhood are likely to pay higher taxes. Will some older homes be less marketable than newer homes and will some areas appreciate at a greater pace? Absolutely and that can create a shift in how taxes are apportioned between property owners ODonnell said. Homeowners can certainly face higher taxes when their properties are reassessed but typically the main cause of higher property taxes is school budgets ODonnell said. Because property taxes are the main source of revenue for funding local schools an increase in educational budgets typically translates into higher tax rates.  Most people dont participate in the budget process ODonnell said. There are a number of work sessions and hearings to address the budget. As a local official Ive been to many. They have a 2000 seat auditorium and a half dozen people there. Homeowners in cities or counties that wait several years to reassess properties are more likely to face an unwelcome surprise when the new valuations arrive he added. The longer it goes between evaluation one and evaluation two the larger fluctuations will be and the more upset people will be.  For Van Donsel it had been 15 years since Burlington Vermont last issued property assessments.  The value didnt seem believable to me. The thought that I could sell it for as much as they assessed it seemed ridiculous she said declining to give the newly assessed value of her home. But she added real estate values have only increased since then. Maybe it could now. Aimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch where she covers business and personal finance.
