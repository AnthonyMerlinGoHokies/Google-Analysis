Universal healthcare is a system that provides health insurance to all regardless of their ability to pay. It helps ensure that a country s residents can access the medical care they need no matter their financial situation.  Let s take a deeper look at universal healthcare. We ll cover the different types of universal healthcare its pros and cons countries that have adopted it and more. Universal healthcare seeks to make accessing healthcare a fundamental right for citizens of a country. Under universal healthcare everyone can expect to receive the healthcare they need without financial difficulty.  Universal healthcare is said to date back to 19th century Germany where a system was set up that required industrial employers to provide healthcare to workers. To do so employees and employers contributed to sickness funds which they used to pay for care.  Today universal healthcare systems exist worldwide including Australia Canada Japan and the United Kingdom.  There are pros and cons to each universal healthcare system. Perhaps that s why we see such varied systems across the dozens of countries that offer universal healthcare today. Let s review the pros and cons of universal healthcare.  Maybe the greatest benefit of universal healthcare is that it gives each citizen the ability to access healthcare services regardless of their ability to pay. The World Health Organization argues that healthcare is a fundamental right and that providing citizens with access to healthcare is one of the most important roles of a government. Lower costs for both citizens and healthcare providers Under a universal healthcare system there s no competition among health insurance companies. Instead a single governing entity regulates healthcare costs. This can drive the cost of healthcare down substantially. Similarly it reduces administrative costs for doctors and healthcare practitioners.  A universal healthcare system could save over 450 billion per year according to a 2022 Yale study. This could help many since polls have found that nearly 4 out of 10 Americans have delayed or gone without healthcare because of costs.  Removing barriers for citizens to grow their careers Some workers in today s job market may receive an offer for a higher paying job that would advance their career yet turn it down because the health insurance is not as good.  Universal healthcare could remove this barrier allowing citizens to grow their skills unencumbered by worries about their healthcare costs.  An overall healthier population A universal healthcare system has more incentive than a privatized system to direct spending toward preventive measures.  For example spending on intervention programs in elementary schools for appropriate diet and exercise may effectively reduce heart problems later in life and associated doctor visits.  From an individualistic perspective the greatest argument against universal healthcare might be that each individual would likely lose a degree of choice. Under privatized care individuals can choose their health insurance from different plans that fit their needs. In a universal system some may want additional coverage.  Possible lowerquality care If healthcare providers receive inadequate reimbursement for their costs they may sacrifice the quality of care or narrow their service offerings.  Longer wait times In addition to possibly creating longer wait times for healthcare universal healthcare could restrict access to certain services like elective procedures.  A lack of competition can reduce innovation Where there s competition organizations must search for less expensive or better ways to do things to win customers. Without competition there may be a lack of innovation to provide new services among providers.  Although some may associate universal healthcare with a singlepayer system universal healthcare can come in several forms. These include the Beveridge National Health Insurance and Bismarck models. Let s review the different ways that governments provide universal healthcare worldwide. The Beveridge model refers to a healthcare system that is entirely funded by the government via income taxes. Under this model a majority of health staff gets paid and managed by the government.  Under The Beveridge model every citizen has a right to healthcare and can receive services with no outofpocket costs.  Under this model every citizen pays into a publicly run health insurance program typically through income taxes and the government uses these funds to pay for healthcare hence the name singlepayer.  Unlike the Beveridge model a singlepayer system uses privatesector healthcare providers. This mix of privatized and socialized healthcare typically keeps healthcare costs low and allows patients to choose their provider.  Under this system employees and employers pay into an insurance system that behaves as a sickness fund. Some countries use a singlepayer model with only one insurer while others have multiple competing insurers. The government then tightly regulates prices so insurers do not make a profit.  Unlike many developed countries the United States doesn t offer universal healthcare. Instead the U.S. offers a combination of private insurance and governmentrun healthcare. About twothirds of U.S. citizens use private insurance while the remaining onethird access governmentrun healthcare.  The Affordable Care Act is the United States attempt to make affordable care available to more of its citizens. Although it s not universal healthcare the Affordable Care Act requires all citizens to have health insurance and offers lowincome citizens access to subsidized healthcare through Medicaid a joint federal and state program. Although the U.S. doesn t have universal healthcare there are still ways you can try to reduce your costs for example  If you have medical debt check to see if debt consolidation loans can save you money.
https://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/podcast/knowledge-at-wharton-podcast/u-s-need-universal-health-care/, Wharton s Robert Hughes speaks with Wharton Business Daily on SiriusXM about the need for universal health care in the U.S. Nothing quite exposes the inequalities that exist in American society more than the health care system. It s a complex combination of private insurance public programs and politics that drives up costs creating significant barriers to lifesaving medical treatment for large segments of the population. In America access to quality health care often depends on income employment and status. Robert Hughes professor of business ethics and legal studies at Wharton is an advocate for universal health care coverage. Drawing deeply on his research in philosophy Hughes believes that equal access to medical care is beneficial for both liberty and social stability. Health he says should not be tied to wealth.  I think it s very disturbing that people have to go to GoFundMe in order to get their medical treatments paid for. It creates a power imbalance he said referring to the crowdsourcing platform used to help raise money for patient bills. That s why I say that truly universal health care would be good for people s liberty. Because you re not really free if you re depending on charity especially discretionary charity like the kind you see on GoFundMe for a basic need like health care.  Hughes recently joined the Wharton Business Daily radio show on SiriusXM to discuss universal health care in the context of the presidential election. Listen to the podcast at the top of this page. Presidentelect Joe Biden has said he will protect and rebuild the Affordable Care Act which has been under attack since it was enacted in 2010 under President Barack Obama. The ACA commonly referred to as Obamacare brought the U.S. closer to providing universal health care through subsidized private health insurance but Hughes said there s still a wide gap. He believes policymakers should ensure that everyone has coverage and access to the same needed treatments.  It s very disturbing that people have to go to GoFundMe in order to get their medical treatments paid for. It creates a power imbalance.   I think it s totally feasible for us to change the health care system if we all were willing to do the right thing. But we re not all willing to do the right thing Hughes said. The professor argued the case for universal health care in a paper titled Egalitarian Provision of Necessary Medical Treatment which was published last year in the Journal of Ethics. The authoraccepted version is here. He examined the health care systems of the U.K. Australia and Canada concluding that Canada s singlepayer system is the most advantageous for the U.S. Private insurance would still exist under such a setup but it could not be used to pay for treatments already covered under universal health care. This provision would eliminate wealth as the controlling factor in health.  I don t understand why there s so much resistance to the idea of truly universal health insurance in the United States given that this is something that other industrial countries just do Hughes said. He acknowledged that the U.S. doesn t have the political will to change a system that s been entrenched since the end of World War II when employers began offering health insurance to their workers instead of higher wages.  We can t wave a magic wand and go back to 1946 he said. I don t see the United States completely uprooting all these insurances. And that means we might need to create a model that keeps a lot of what we have making it more accessible to more people rather than creating all new institutions from scratch.

https://healthcare.procon.org/, 27.5 million nonelderly Americans did not have health insurance in 2021 a decline from 28.9 million uninsured Americans in 2019. The largest group of Americans almost 155 million nonelderly people were covered by employersponsored health insurance. Less than 1 of Americans over 65 were uninsured thanks to Medicaid a government provided insurance for people over 65 years old. The United States is the only nation among the 37 OECD Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development nations that does not have universal health care either in practice or by constitutional right. Read more background  A national health insurance is a universal health care that uses public insurance to pay for privatepractice care. Every citizen pays into the national insurance plan. Administrative costs are lower because there is one insurance company. The government also has a lot of leverage to force medical costs down according to economic expert Kimberly Amadeo. Canada Taiwan and South Korea all have national health insurance. In the United States Medicare Medicaid and TRICARE function similarly. 178 Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older certain younger people with disabilities and people with EndStage Renal Disease permanent kidney failure requiring dialysis or a transplant sometimes called ESRD. Patients pay a monthly premium for Medicare Part B general health coverage. The 2023 standard Part B monthly premium is 164.90. Patients also contribute to drug costs via Medicare Part D. Most people do not pay a premium for Medicare Part A inpatient hospital stays care in a skilled nursing facility hospice care and some home health care . More than 65.3 million people were enrolled in Medicare according to Feb. 2023 government data. 180 181 Medicaid provides health coverage to millions of Americans including eligible lowincome adults children pregnant women elderly adults and people with disabilities. Medicaid is administered by states according to federal requirements. The program is funded jointly by states and the federal government. More than 84.8 million people were enrolled in Medicaid as of Nov. 2022. 181 182 183 The Children s Health Insurance Program CHIP often lumped in with Medicaid in these discussions is a lowcost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid. In some states CHIP covers pregnant women. Each state offers CHIP coverage and works closely with its state Medicaid program. CHIP covers more than 6.9 million patients. 181 182 183 TRICARE is the military health system that provides care to almost 10 million activeduty service members retired personnel and their families. Activeduty military members pay 0 for health insurance while retired members and their families paid a premium up to 1165 per month for a member and family in 2021. 184 The United States already successfully maintains universal health care for almost 36 of the U.S. population according to U.S. Census data released in Sep. 2022. As the Baby Boomer generation continues to age and more of the generation becomes eligible for Medicare estimates suggest about 73.5 million people will use Medcare and about 47 of American health care costs will be paid for by public health services by 2027. 185 186 If the government can successfully provide universal health care for 36 to almost 50 of the population then the government can provide univeral health care for the rest of the population who are just as in need and deserving of leading healthy lives. A June 2022 study found the United States could have saved 105.6 billion in COVID19 coronavirus hospitalization costs with singlepayer universal health care during the pandemic. That potential savings is on top of the estimated 438 billion the researchers estimated could be saved annually with universal health care in a nonpandemic year. 198  Taking into account both the costs of coverage expansion and the savings that would be achieved through the Medicare for All Act we calculate that a singlepayer universal healthcare system is likely to lead to a 13 savings in national healthcare expenditure equivalent to more than US450 billion annually based on the value of the US in 2017. The entire system could be funded with less financial outlay than is incurred by employers and households paying for healthcare premiums combined with existing government allocations. This shift to singlepayer health care would provide the greatest relief to lowerincome households conclude researchers from the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues. 201 According to the National Bankruptcy Forum medical debt is the number one reason people file for bankruptcy in the United States. In 2017 about 33 of all Americans with medical bills reported that they were unable to pay for basic necessities like food heat or housing. If all Americans were provided health care under a singlepayer system medical bankruptcy would no longer exist because the government not private citizens would pay all medical bills. 131 Further prescription drug costs would drop between 4 and 31 according to five cost estimates gathered by New York Times reporters. 24 of people taking prescription drugs reported difficulty affording the drugs according to a Kaiser Family Foundation KFF poll. 58 of people whose drugs cost more than 100 a month 49 of people in fair or poor health 35 of those with annual incomes of less than 40000 and 35 of those taking four or more drugs monthly all reported affordability issues. 197 199 200 Additionally 30 of people aged 50 to 64 reported cost issues because they generally take more drugs than younger people but are not old enough to qualify for Medicare drug benefits. With 79 of Americans saying prescription drug costs are unreasonable and 70 reporting lowering prescription drug costs as their highest healthcare priority lowering the cost of prescription drugs would lead to more drugcompliance and lives not only bettered but saved as a result. 197 199 200 Since 2020 the COVID19 pandemic has underscored the public health economic and moral repercussions of widespread dependence on employersponsored insurance the most common source of coverage for workingage Americans . Business closures and restrictions led to unemployment for more than 9 million individuals following the emergence of COVID19. Consequently many Americans lost their healthcare precisely at a time when COVID19 sharply heightened the need for medical services argue researchers from the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues. The researchers estimated more than 131000 COVID19 coronavirus deaths and almost 78000 nonCOVID19 deaths could have been prevented with universal health care in 2020 alone. 198 Another study finds a change to singlepayer health care would save more than 68000 lives and 1.73 million lifeyears every year compared with the status quo. 201 Meanwhile more people would be able to access muchneeded health care. A Jan. 2021 study concludes that universal health care would increase outpatient visits by 7 to 10 and hospital visits by 0 to 3 which are modest increases when compared to saved and lengthened lives. 202 Other studies find that universal health coverage is linked to longer life expectancy lower child mortality rates higher smoking cessation rates lower depression rates and a higher general sense of wellbeing with more people reporting being in excellent health. Further universal health care leads to appropriate use of health care facilities including lower rates of emergency room visits for nonemergencies and a higher use of preventative doctors visits to manage chronic conditions. 203 204 205 An American Hospital Association report argues the high rate of uninsured patients puts stress on the broader health care system. People without insurance put off needed care and rely more heavily on hospital emergency departments resulting in scarce resources being directed to treat conditions that often could have been prevented or managed in a lowercost setting. Being uninsured also has serious financial implications for individuals communities and the health care system. 205 In addition to providing universal health care for the elderly lowincome individuals children in need and military members and their families the United States has the Affordable Care Act the ACA formerly known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or Obamacare which ensures that Americans can access affordable health care. the ACA allows Americans to chose the coverage appropriate to their health conditions and incomes. 187 Veterans Affairs which serves former military members is an example of a singlepayer health care provider and one that has repeatedly failed its patients. For example a computer error at the Spokane VA hospital failed to deliver more than 11000 orders for specialty care lab work and other services without alerting health care providers the orders had been lost. 188 189  Elizabeth Hovde Policy Analyst and Director of the Centers for Health Care and Worker Rights argues The VA system is not only costly with inconsistent medical care results it s an American example of a singlepayer governmentrun system. We should run from the attempts in our state to decrease competition in the health care system and increase government dependency leaving our health care at the mercy of a monopolistic system that does not need to be timely or responsive to patients. Policymakers should give veterans meaningful choices among private providers clinics and hospitals so vets can choose their own doctors and directly access quality care that meets their needs. Best of all when the routine breakdowns of a governmentrun system threaten to harm them again as happened in Spokane veterans can take their wellearned health benefit and find help elsewhere. 188 189 Further the challenges of universal health care implementation are vastly different in the U.S. than in other countries making the current patchwork of health care options the best fit for the country. As researchers summarize Though the majority of postindustrial Westernized nations employ a universal healthcare model few if any of these nations are as geographically large populous or ethnicallyracially diverse as the U.S. Different regions in the U.S. are defined by distinct cultural identities citizens have unique religious and political values and the populace spans the socio economic spectrum. Moreover heterogenous climates and population densities confer different health needs and challenges across the U.S. Thus critics of universal healthcare in the U.S. argue that implementation would not be as feasible organizationally or financially as other developed nations. 190 And such a system in the United States would hinder medical innovation and entrepreneurship. Government control is a large driver of America s health care problems. Bureaucrats can t revolutionize health care only entrepreneurs can. By empowering health care entrepreneurs we can create an American health care system that is more affordable accessible and productive for all explains Wayne Winegarden Senior Fellow in Business and Economics and Director of the Center for Medical Economics and Innovation at Pacific Research Institute. 190 191 Medicareforall a recent universal health care proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders IVT would cost an estimated 30 to 40 trillion over ten years. The cost would be the largest single increase to the federal budget ever. 192 The Congressional Budget Office CBO estimates that by 2030 federal health care subsidies will increase by 1.5 to 3.0 trillion. The CBO concludes Because the singlepayer options that CBO examined would greatly increase federal subsidies for health care the government would need to implement new financing mechanisms such as raising existing taxes or introducing new ones reducing certain spending or issuing federal debt. As an example if the government required employers to make contributions toward the cost of health insurance under a singlepayer system that would be similar to their contributions under current law it would have to impose new taxes. 193 Despite claims by many the cost of Medicare for All or any other universal health care option could not be financed solely by increased taxes on the wealthy. Taxes on the middle class would have to rise in order to pay for it. Those taxes could be imposed directly on workers indirectly through taxes on employers or consumption or through a combination of direct or indirect taxes. There is simply not enough available revenue from high earners and businesses to cover the full cost of eliminating premiums ending all costsharing and expanding coverage to all Americans and for virtually all health services says the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. 195 An analysis of the Sanders plan estimates that the average annual cost of the plan would be approximately 2.5 trillion per year creating an average of over a 1 trillion per year financing shortfall. To fund the program payroll and income taxes would have to increase from a combined 8.4 percent in the Sanders plan to 20 percent while also retaining all remaining tax increases on capital gains increased marginal tax rates the estate tax and eliminating tax expenditures . Overall over 70 percent of working privately insured households would pay more under a fully funded single payer plan than they do for health insurance today. 196 The Congressional Budget Office explains A singlepayer system with little cost sharing for medical services would lead to increased demand for care in the United States because more people would have health insurance and because those already covered would use more services. The extent to which the supply of care would be adequate to meet that increased demand would depend on various factors such as the payment rates for providers and any measures taken to increase supply. If coverage was nearly universal cost sharing was very limited and the payment rates were reduced compared with current law the demand for medical care would probably exceed the supply of care with increased wait times for appointments or elective surgeries greater wait times at doctors offices and other facilities or the need to travel greater distances to receive medical care. Some demand for care might be unmet. 207 As an example of lengthy wait times associated with universal coverage in 2017 Canadians were on waiting lists for an estimated 1040791 procedures and the median wait time for arthroplastic surgery was 20 52 weeks. Similarly average waiting time for elective hospitalbased care in the United Kingdom is 46 days while some patients wait over a year. Increased wait times in the U.S. would likely occur at least in the short term as a result of a steep rise in the number of primary and emergency care visits due to eliminating the financial barrier to seek care as well as general wastefulness inefficiency and disorganization that is often associated with bureaucratic governmentrun agencies. 17 190 Joshua W. Axene of Axene Health Partners LLC wonders if Americans really could function under a system that is budget based and would likely have increased waiting times. In America we have created a healthcare culture that pays providers predominantly on a Fee for Service basis FFS and allows people to get what they want when they want it and generally from whoever they want. American healthcare culture always wants the best thing available and has a more is better mentality. Under a government sponsored socialized healthcare system choice would become more limited timing mandated and supply and demand would be controlled through the constraints of a healthcare budget . As much as Americans believe that they are crockpots and can be patient we are more like microwaves and want things fast and on our own terms. Extended waiting lines will not work in the American system and would decrease the quality of our system as a whole. 206 Did You Know?1. 27.5 million nonelderly Americans did not have health insurance in 2021 a decline from 28.9 million uninsured Americans in 2019. 162 1632.

https://ysph.yale.edu/news-article/yale-study-more-than-335000-lives-could-have-been-saved-during-pandemic-if-us-had-universal-health-care/, If the U.S. had had a singlepayer universal health care system in 2020 nearly 212000 American lives would have been saved that year according to a new study. In addition the country would have saved 105 billion in COVID19 hospitalization expenses alone.  The research team further calculated that in a nonpandemic year some 438 billion would be saved by singlepayer universal health care like Medicare for All. The results make a powerful case for health care reform according to lead author Alison Galvani Ph.D.  Americans are needlessly losing lives and money said Galvani director of Yale s Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis and an endowed chair in the Department of Epidemiology Microbial Diseases at the Yale School of Public Health. Medicare for All would be both an economic stimulus and lifesaving transformation of our health care system.  The researchers compared people with and without health insurance examining death rates from COVID19 and overall. Building on earlier research they calculated that 131438 COVID deaths in 2020 could have been avoided with universal singlepayer health care. Overall including both COVID and nonCOVID patients 211897 lives would have been saved in 2020 with universal care. From the start of the pandemic in the U.S. to March 2022 those preventable deaths mount to 338594. Far from financially burdening the nation universal singlepayer health care would not only have saved lives it would have also avoided hundreds of billions of dollars in costs. Medicare for All would reduce costs by improving access to preventive care reducing administrative overhead and empowering Medicare to negotiate prices the researchers said. Singlepayer health care would also eliminate pricy insurance premiums and reduce fraud.  A singlepayer health care system would be much more economically efficient than our current fragmented structure and would save over 450 billion per year Galvani said. The United States currently spends more on health care than any other nation both per person and overall. Despite such heavy spending the piecemeal nature of the U.S. medical insurance system worsened COVID19 s effects the researchers argue in the study. Many people without access to adequate health care delayed necessary medical treatment postponed isolation and kept working when they felt sick. These factors can fuel infections and deaths. Most workingage Americans rely on employersponsored plans with each enrollment typically covering more than one person. That system still left 41 million Americans uninsured before the pandemic. Universal singlepayer health care is both economically responsible and morally imperative. Then during the pandemic over 9 million workers became unemployed. As a result many people became uninsured including in some cases entire families. Medicare for All would save lives in a number of ways according to the researchers  Universal singlepayer health care is both economically responsible and morally imperative Galvani said. Meagan C.

Achieving universal health coverage for all U.S. residents requires significant systemwide changes in financing of health care. The best most efficient equitable health system is a public singlepayer SP system. The rapid growth in national health expenditures can be addressed through a system that yields net savings over projected trends by eliminating profit and waste. With universal coverage providers can focus on optimizing triage of services rather than working within a system covered by payers who have incentives to limit costs regardless of benefit. With SP systems people act as their own insurers through partnerships with provider organizations wherein tax dollars work for everyone. Consumer choice is then based on best care to meet needs with no outofpocket payments. SP is the best option to ensure equity fairness and priorities aligned with medical needs. This approach benefits public health as everyone will have universal access to needed care with treatment plans based on what works best for the patient. Clinics and hospitals will be free to provide appropriate treatments based on need. Hospitals will accept all patients with care reimbursed equally for all. Resolving the great discrepancy in coverage for mental health and substance use disorders relative to medical and surgical services is more likely in an SP model. Patients will partner in their care receiving diagnosis treatment and prevention services without facing cost barriers. We will build a healthier nation saving lives and reducing financial burdens while addressing inequities rooted in social demographic mental health economic and political conditions. Relationship to Existing APHA Policy Statements The proposed policy is an update and extension of the following APHA policy statements The proposed policy is supported by the following previous policy statements Problem StatementRising per capita costs of health care in the United States National health expenditure NHE in the United States grew by 4.6 in 2018 to 3.65 trillion 11172 per capita.1 This accounted for 17.7 of the gross domestic product GDP at the time.12 The United States spends the most by far on health care among all 36 countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD both as a proportion of GDP and per capita.34 Despite using fewer health care resources the country spends 2000 more per person than the nexthighestspending country Switzerland and nearly twice as much per capita on health care as the median for OECD countries.35 The pricing system is inherently the single greatest driver of health care costs while providing fewer key health resources.3 There is also a large and widening gap in the prices that public and private payers are charged for identical services which indicates that the rising total NHE is primarily driven by private health care insurers3 and pharmaceutical expenditures in particular.6 U.S. pharmaceutical expenditures U.S. prescription drug expenditures reached 335 billion in 2018 a 28 increase in a decade.6 The growth is expected to continue and is projected to increase 67.3 to 560 billion by 2028.6 In 2018 annual per capita U.S. prescription drug spending was 1221 well above that of the United Kingdom 526 Sweden 534 and Germany 884.7 Prescription drug expenditures alone will represent 19.7 of the U.S. GDP by 2028.6 Increased prescription drug expenditures will be largely driven by manufacturers increases in drug prices.8 One of the distinctions in U.S. prescription policy is the burden of drug costs borne by patients as outofpocket costs. For instance the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit has no cap on outofpocket costs for beneficiaries.9 Drug prices are significantly higher in the United States than in any other OECD country. By contrast the United Kingdom requires little or no cost sharing by patients. Countries that have implemented singlepayer SP financing systems offer multiple examples of ways to reduce drug prices including harmonization of pharmaceutical coverage pricing over a single formulary or across formularies exclusion of added administrative costs from pharmacy benefit managers and leveraging of scale to negotiate prices with suppliers. Efficiency in the United States relative to singlepayer countries While the United States spends more per capita on health care than any other OECD country the additional spending contributes little value from either an economic or a health outcomes perspective.3510 Countries with SP spend less while their populations live longer healthier lives.11 The average life expectancy and the burden of adverse health outcomes for almost all major chronic illnesses apart from cancer treatments in the United States also fall short of the OECD median.71011As far back as 2003 administrative costs of health care including insurance reimbursement and other administrative tasks accounted for nearly a third 31 of the U.S. NHE.1213 By 2011 the country still spent more of its NHE on the administrative costs of the reimbursement system than any other country 8 18 of health care spending.4514 Analyses between countries with a variety of health insurance systems showed that both SP most optimal and twotiered systems such as those in France and Japan operated with lower administrative costs than the insurancemandated systems of the United States and Switzerland.5 A twotiered system involves a public insuranceanddelivery system and another based on private health insurance. Notably the Swiss system with the second highest NHE per capita of OECD countries demonstrated significantly lower administrative costs than the United States indicating that there is room for correction even within publicprivate systems.5 According to one analysis updating the 2003 analysis through 2017 excess administrative costs in the United States relative to Canada SP have persisted and still account for 17 of the NHE.15 Excess U.S. spending is driven by the availability not utilization of medical technology and broad service pricing as opposed to a higher rate of health care consumption.3 Health care services are provided at a less efficient cost for equivalent levels of care.3 Neither the quantity nor quality of care is improved by the increase in U.S. spending whether per capita or as a percentage of the GDP.3 The United States funded 50.9 of its NHE through private payers in 2016 as compared with the OECD median of 25.0. While public spending on health care is also higher than in most OECD countries that have a majority above 80 public payer system in place private insurers drive the largest segment of excess cost in the U.S. health care system. Furthermore the gap between publicly and privately funded health care prices in the United States widened from 2000 to 2016 with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission estimating that private insurers pay prices 50 higher than Medicare payments for identical services.16 Reducing fractionalization through consolidation of private insurers into fewer larger private payer organizations does not necessarily lower plan costs for individuals premiums copayments deductibles or the overall system.17 Instead these mergers tend to shift profits away from the delivery system providing cost savings to insurers without generating cost savings to society.17 Access and equity issues Lack of insurance is the primary systemic barrier to health care access in the United States demonstrating that multiple financing systems fall short of universal coverage. Universal health coverage means that all people have access to the health services they need when and where they need them without financial hardship.18 It includes the full range of essential health services from health promotion to prevention treatment rehabilitation and palliative care.In addition the high cost of health care in the United States exacerbates existing health care disparities that result in premature morbidity and mortality and intersects with race social and socioeconomic status age and disability. One feature of the United States health care system is the prevalence of highdeductible health care plans. These plans intended to incentivize patients to not overutilize health care disproportionately affect individuals with low incomes. In the period from 2003 to 2014 when highdeductible health plans proliferated and overall increases in U.S. health care spending slowed down health care expenditures for the wealthiest quintile grew by 20 while falling by 3.7 in the lowest quintile group despite this group having the worst health outcomes.19 In addition since health care expenses are not proportional to personal income individuals with low incomes pay a larger percentage of their household income toward health care costs. Thus the private health insurance market exacerbates wealth inequality by functioning in a manner similar to a regressive tax. A survey of health care expenditure data showed that this system effectively redistributes 1.7 of total income from individuals with lower incomes to those with higher incomes.20 These plans produce devastating financial and health outcomes for Americans with low incomes. One American study showed that among patients with cardiovascular disease almost 60 of those with low incomes faced financial hardship or were unable to pay their medical bills resulting in food insecurity and inability to take prescribed medications.21 Even among the insured close to 40 of patients with insurance still faced financial hardship due to the outofpocket expenses associated with their plans.21 One study revealed that highdeductible plans led to delays in diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer in women with both high and low incomes although the effect was more pronounced among those with low incomes.22 Another study showed that highdeductible plans reduce utilization of potentially highvalue care such as preventive and outpatient medical visits.23 Despite the passage of the Affordable Care Act ACA there are also persistent racial health disparities in the U.S. uninsured population.2425 In 2019 the rates of uninsurance among adults not qualified for Medicare were 7.8 for White 11.4 for Black and 20.0 for Hispanic individuals.24 This leads to racial and ethnic disparities in receiving recommended care for example one study showed that Black Hispanic and Asian individuals with diabetes were 23 to 53 less likely to receive annual hemoglobin A1c tests.26 Lack of universal health care also exacerbates health inequities based on citizenship and immigration status. One study revealed that 40 states withhold coverage of dialysis for patients with end stage renal disease ESRD who are undocumented immigrants.27 In these states ESRD patients can access dialysis only on an emergency basis. The same study showed that in states that did cover dialysis there was a 14 absolute reduction in mortality and a 5678 reduction per patient in total health care costs associated with providing this coverage to people with ESRD who are undocumented.27 High outofpocket expenses and lack of universal coverage exacerbate health disparities among people with disabilities. According to one study older adults with disabilities are more likely to delay seeing a doctor despite having insurance because of outofpocket expenses.28 Multipayer insurance systems exacerbate segregation along economic racial immigration status and disability lines by creating financial incentives to take care of particular patients based on their insurance status. For example one study showed that academic medical centers which are widely regarded as providing the highest quality of care are much less likely to treat racial minority Medicaid and uninsured patients in New York City.29 An examination of the current state of behavioral health care in the United States reveals even larger gaps.30 This is an area that has suffered from lack of financial support historically and also from the compounded cumulative negative behavioral and primary health effects of COVID19 since 2020. Making singlepayer reform work for behavioral health is possible by revisiting the lessons learned from Canada and other countries that have adopted SP systems.1531 EvidenceBased Strategies to Address the ProblemAPHA has called for universal coverage of health care for all U.S. residents for decades.32 This has included calls for a unified nationally coordinated and nationally funded approach i.e. SP to health care expenditure since the late 1970s. This goal for coverage met by the majority of other developed countries in the world is no longer in question but the best approach is still being debated in policy and political spheres. In this debate the evidence in support of SP has grown rapidly in the past decade. In addition recent polls conducted with broad clinician samples have shown that a majority of doctors strongly support policy reform to implement SP.33 The American College of Physicians ACP the second largest provider organization in the United States has also recommended that U.S. policy initiate a transition to a system of universal coverage through either an SP or a public payer choice capable of supporting universal coverage.34 Singlepayer health system In 1993 the APHA leadership and executive board developed 14 Points on Health Reform in order to organize and guide the essential criteria for reform of public health.35 These points continue to guide the principles of the public health field in developing proposals for national health reform.36 Overall the evidence clearly demonstrates that SP is the most optimal structure for health reform in order to support these principles. Designing implementing and transitioning to a singlepayer system may entail significant changes in the sources and extent of coverage provider payment mechanisms and financing of health care services in the current U.S. health care system.37 The federal government could administer some functions of the singlepayer health plan at the national level and delegate other functions to state and local governments. Alternatively state governments could administer the singlepayer health plan with broad federal oversight.37 Singlepayer system implementation can be done in incremental stages starting with people who have health insurance coverage through various public sources Medicare Medicaid Children s Health Insurance Program Veterans Administration who could continue to have such coverage under a singlepayer system although covered benefits and costsharing agreements might change.38 People who have private insurance primarily employerbased insurance may enroll in the public plan and might retain private coverage that supplements the coverage under the public plan preserving public financing and redistributing revenues among the pools to attenuate risk selection.39 With regard to health insurance several countries progressively transitioned from multiple large insurance pools to singlepayer systems while building the financial and administrative capacity to establish a single insurance pool. An alternative approach would be to first standardize the health plans that can be offered in the market.38 All of these approaches may be slowed by legal challenges from states or business interests but they each reflect a lower risk as changes to taxation and federal program reimbursement do not involve the constitutional rights issues posed by individual mandates to purchase private plans. Overall a singlepayer system will significantly simplify revenue collection and benefit payouts to a single agency.40 Countries with singlepayer systems experience significant cost savings over their multipayer counterparts through streamlining of billing and insurance procedures creation of a more equitable and predictable spread of risk throughout the entire populace and leveraging of bargaining power to control costs.40International evidence of quality and cost with SP In Taiwan the national health insurance system was introduced in 1994 the system was modeled in part on the U.S. Medicare program although it was created to cover all citizens and foreign residents of the country boasting a 99.9 enrollment rate.41 Benefits are uniform and comprehensive covering hospital care physician care pharmaceuticals and other services. Subsequent to 1994 the health system in Taiwan adopted both payforperformance measures and a global budget mechanism to improve quality while reducing cost of care.41 Patients in Taiwan can choose their doctors or hospitals freely instead of being limited to a certain network of providers as in the United States.42 This enhances access to care for disadvantaged populations but also encourages providers to improve the quality and thereby the value of care to attract patients. Also the government sets rates thus collaborating with other providers increases every provider s market share and simultaneously mitigates the consequences of fragmentation. Beneficiaries with low incomes under the singlepayer health system in Taiwan can either receive exemptions from cost sharing or directly receive their medical care.37 Enrolling individuals with low incomes and providing them with public health services may prevent them from using costly and unnecessary emergency care which affects both provider and patient more heavily. It may also discourage private insurance companies and providers from securing profits through reducing coverage or even rejecting beneficiaries with low incomes.43The Canadian health system administered by the provinces is a funding partnership between the provincial and federal governments similar to the shared state and federal funding in the United States. Provider diagnostic and hospital costs are covered based on a federally negotiated fee schedule and providers are not allowed to receive private payments at or above those costs for any covered services. Private insurance exists only to cover services not already covered by the national system. Provinces administer billing and reimbursement services but these services must be comprehensive defined by the province universal citizens and legal residents portable across provinces and accessible which means no copays or other user fees. Comparative analyses of physician utilization in Canada and the United States demonstrate higher utilization rates among populations that are sicker and have lower incomes in Canada suggesting that more equitable allocation of resources in the United States could lead to improved public health.44 Australia provides coverage through a hybrid SP universal health system Medicare available to all citizens and permanent residents. The costs of publicly funded primary and other basic health services 67 of all health spending are shared by national state and local governments with the remainder paid through individual and employer contributions. Australia and other countries using a hybrid approach mandate copays or deductibles for additional private plans in order to manage use of specialist and other highcost services and employ electronic medical record systems to track patient utilization patterns.374546 Financial feasibility The economic benefits of an SP system are rapidly realized by reducing the high administrative costs primarily billing and insurancerelated costs in the current U.S. health delivery systems even when accounting for expanded coverage among those currently uninsured and residing in the country.547 These costs emanate from the use of multiple differing insurance companies allowable charges reasons to deny care coding provider network negotiations and care restrictions deductibles and copays.3747 Furthermore systemwide cost savings are realized by eliminating the processes for collecting copays and outofpocket expenses from patients.3748 One review estimated a mean of 556 billion in potential annual savings.48 Within the estimated increased federal expenditures required to support universal coverage through a public SP is the offsetting cost transfer from fewer private sector charges and projections of further increases in costs under the status quo.37 In a review published by the RAND Corporation SP plans offering universal and comprehensive coverage models were projected to generate a total net savings of 121 billion annually to the NHE.48 Certain models with supplemental insurance options have demonstrated reductions in annual NHE by 211 billion and federal expenditures by 40 billion even without the theorized savings from administrative efficiency.48 A more recent economic review showed that 20 of 22 SP proposals from the past 30 years would provide net savings within the first several years if implemented in 2020.47 Relative to the projected growth in health care costs under 2020 conditions and trends all of these proposals would offer longerterm net savings.47 As seen during the COVID19 pandemic the health of the nation relies on creating a universal efficiently coordinated system that improves access eliminates disincentives to preventive care and fosters access with a streamlined approach to universal coverage. Indeed a singlepayer health system is not only financially feasible but also the most fiscally viable approach for all. Reducing national pharmaceutical expenditures A national drug formulary is an important tool of universal singlepayer health care systems e.g. the 2013 Medicare for All Act4950 intended to rein in everincreasing U.S. drug expenditures.49 A national formulary can achieve reduced drug expenditures in two ways. First it restricts duplicative and unnecessary medications within a class of drugs while allowing waivers to provide access for the occasional exception.4951 Second by supporting price negotiation at the national level manufacturers will have substantial incentives to be included in the formulary drug category.51 The Veterans Administration health system exemplifies a national formulary system with a public health perspective that has been shown to change physician behavior favorably while providing substantial cost savings through price reductions from manufacturers.49 51 Access and equity strategies An SP system creates new opportunities to improve racial health disparities beyond the impact of eliminating differences in rates of insurance. An SP that includes coverage for workplace injuries and illnesses could eliminate cost shifting within the workers compensation system that currently burdens workers with 50 of the costs adding inequality to injury. SP would also address the socioeconomic disparities that have been described in our health care system. People who are uninsured and underinsured are more likely to have delays in medical care. Medical debt is also associated with housing instability and homelessness.52 Because a singlepayer health system would create health care savings by creating a more efficient administrative system as a matter of health equity some of these savings can and should be used to address additional ways to tackle health disparities outside of insurance. A singlepayer health care system would also address the socioeconomic disparities that have been described in the United States. An SP that breaks down financial barriers to care would help resolve rationing of medical care based on socioeconomic status. A study of health care expenditures and finance in Canada showed that the country s SP reduced income inequality between income groups by 16 solely through more equitable health care utilization.53 Clinical factors are also a source of inequities in health care services in insured populations. For example coverage of mental health and behavioral services has not been on an equal footing with medical and surgical services in the U.S. forprofit health insurance environment. Since 2008 federal law Mental Health Parity and Addition Equity Act has mandated insurers to provide mental health coverage equivalent to medical surgical coverage. While substantial gains in parity have been made since the passage of the Affordable Care Act the challenge of real mental health parity in regulating managed care for mental health remains. Publicly financed health care is far more likely to achieve real parity than a forprofit insurance industry.454 While an SP universal health care system would not immediately eliminate all of the health disparities outlined above it would address many of the disparities caused by lack of insurance and outofpocket expenses which also lead to reduced utilization of highvalue lowercost care.32755 In addition it would incentivize a public health response focused on reducing disparities in order to reduce the costly care that results from the acute and chronic diseases related to health disparities.342755Improving the value of care SP health care systems have the ability to emphasize chronic and preventive care. As discussed above enrolling individuals with low incomes in comprehensive health benefits in Taiwan decreases the need for costly emergency care.32 Providing comprehensive health benefits can direct patients toward less expensive scheduled care as discussed earlier in the example of coverage of dialysis being associated with lower health care costs due to fewer emergency dialysis visits.27 An SP system should include funding for strategies to improve access to primary care across the country in order to shift care to lowcost highervalue primary care. As discussed above under the current system with high outofpocket expenses even among the insured some patients are less likely to fill prescriptions or obtain needed preventive care deferring costs.20 An SP system aligns the interests of the national insurer to cover preventive care upfront in order to avoid the need for costly care later. Along with improving access to highervalue care SP has the potential to reduce health care costs by altering payment structures to incentivize highvalue care. There have been many proposals regarding alternative payment structures for health care providers to improve the value of care delivery. Although the payment structure for hospitals and physicians is not synonymous with an insurance system these issues are closely entwined. Singlepayer health insurance systems in other countries have used both fee for service FFS and capitation models for health care provider reimbursement. As an example Taiwan implemented an FFS reimbursement model when it first transitioned to a singlepayer health insurance system but introduced capitation to reduce the volume of care being provided as problems arose.56 Evidence for the ability of capitation alone to make health care more efficient is mixed. Some studies have revealed that providers in an FFS method tend to induce more demand for example increasing elective hospital admissions57 whereas other studies have not shown that an effect.58 Many capitation models attempt to adjust payments by baseline health characteristics of patients or populations to minimize physician cherry picking of healthier patients who need less health care and thus are less likely to reach their capitation rate. Within the current U.S. system evidence for the benefit of capitation in some of the accountable care organizations that have adopted this payment model is mixed.59 There has been some concern that despite efforts to avoid negative selection of unhealthier patients or of communities that traditionally suffer from health care disparities accountable care organizations might still be less likely to profit from accepting such patients.60 In the absence of strong alternative evidence valuedriven payment models can and should continue to be studied after the implementation of universal health care through an SP financing model recognizing that any payment structure to physicians and hospitals might operate differently under a new insurance system. The competitive disincentives that undermine capitation models in the current U.S. system are expected to be alleviated when all providers are held to the same reimbursement schedules and risk pools. Education and advocacy The scientific and economic typically peerreviewed debate on SP reform is characterized by caveats5561 or political rationalizations5562 against the larger generally overwhelming economic evidence. However the public debate on SP reform is both more wideranging and more divisive in tone taking on partisan political rhetoric.6364 Providing clear information from the economic debate to the public debate about the actual scientific evidence including the caveats and political complexity of reform is a vital step toward successful SP system transformation. Education and advocacy campaigns directed toward the public6566 and representatives of the legislative and executive branches of government6768 via multiple communication media and forums have successfully demonstrated that communicating facts about policy effectiveness from trusted sources can produce shifts in public and political opinion toward the evidence over time. This can anchor the public and political debate on the details of how best to implement SP reform and move the focus away from the unfounded arguments and rhetoric6163 that are used to manipulate public opinion away from the evidence. Opposing ArgumentsEvidence Political barriers Calls for universal health care in the United States have been made since the beginning of the 20th century and the legislative beginnings of the SP movement have their origin in the WagnerMurrayDingall bills of the 1940s to create a national health insurance system.5569 The fact that decades later the United States still does not have SP is a testament to the significant political barriers to implementing such a system.55 Lessons from history can be illustrative. The national health insurance bills of the 1940s and 1950s faced significant opposition from the American Medical Association AMA which launched widescale public opinion campaigns against nationalized health care using the language of the Red Scare. 5569 However opposition from medical provider groups such as the AMA and ACP has reversed course in recent years.333470 Despite this reversal significant opposition to SP remains among some physician groups that are important stakeholders in health policy reform. Although polls show support for SP among the general population that support might not withstand the scrutiny the policy would receive if it were to have a serious chance of passage. For instance one survey showed that support for the ACA decreased across many different polls after it was initially passed but before many of the provisions took effect suggesting that the increased scrutiny of the bill in that period increased opposition.71 Market forces and barriers It is a common justification for the higher spending in the U.S. health care system that the outsized costs paid to pharmaceutical and medical technology industries in the U.S. market incentivize the greatest innovation and highest quality of care for the country s citizens. Vested interests will also propose that market forces between private payers and providers create the best source of innovation in care delivery models through competitive pressures.556163 However those same innovations drive the annual rise in excessive spending rates year after year. High inputs such as material costs only widen the disparate impact of health care related debts in low and highincome strata. Furthermore governmentadministered health care financing can still direct the system through statutes and payment models incentivizing innovation based on valuebased metrics to achieve the most costeffective care. The competition between provider organizations is not diminished by a level playing field in terms of reimbursement and incentive models. In fact SP financing will only improve the quality of competition. There are other driving forces that affect pharmaceutical prices such as regulatory costs. In fact the general disadvantage of U.S. pharmaceutical pricing is that the prices are higher due to the lack of regulation surrounding the process.1547 SP provides the opportunity for pricing negotiation by federal regulators which is currently not permitted for both pharmaceuticals and other medical technologies. It also places the greatest possible leverage in the hands of the consolidated payment system which will inherently improve market competition and pricing strategies and simultaneously shift the cost share of research and development operations to other large economies around the world. In addition critics point to the threat of rationing of health care long wait times and a lack of choice of health care providers.556163 As evidence that health care providers will constrict program availability these voices sometimes point to anticipated increases in health care demand from individuals newly insured and lower reimbursement rates from Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS programs relative to private insurance providers.6164 However in international comparisons and economic model projections there is no evidence that adopting SP financing will lead to rationing or wait times for timesensitive services.341555 Countries with SP systems do not ration primary care services or require wait times outside of elective procedures.31541 These countries also have highfunctioning economies that are not made less wealthy through their support of accessible efficient health care.47 Currently the U.S. system rations health care by withholding care from those without sufficient economic resources to access the system. Ironically provider choice is a hallmark of the current siloed system with many risk pools and individualized contracts between payers and providers that would be remedied by an SP financing system.31455 Infeasibility of a singlepayer health system due to cost The primary argument in political circles is often that SP will cost the federal government more money increasing the federal mandatory budget and leading to higher taxation or deficit spending or both.556163 Estimates for expanding Medicare to provide universal coverage range widely but a cumulative cost of 32.6 trillion in the first 10 years after implementation 2022 2031 is often estimated.72 Although there are likely to be increased federal expenditures associated with the adoption of SP72 projections must also incorporate the significant reduction in costs generated by private sector payers and clients and the continued growth in health care spending trends under the status quo see the Evidencebased strategies section. Adoption of an SP system is actually projected to both reduce annual net health care expenditure and improve the progression of the health care cost burden by income level48 improving inequities in access. This impact is reflected in the lower per capita costs of coverage in every country with SP.7 There are those who may suggest that adoption of a universal SP health payment system would increase the number of undocumented immigrants entering the country and seeking coverage under the new system thereby increasing the overall NHE as a result of coverage expansion. However neither international economic comparisons nor health service research studies have revealed evidence of changes in immigration patterns documented and undocumented in countries that transition to SP health delivery systems.1229414247 As unlikely as this shift might be economic projections have shown that the cost savings from SP reform are significant enough to outweigh the cost of expanding coverage to currently uninsured populations with a significant margin remaining.45 It is also suggested that the transition to an SP system will have negative impacts on the medical insurance and pharmaceutical industries. While the transition may lead to reduced positions in medical insurance organizations in the short term these organizations are already developing plans to redirect their business models toward supplemental insurance plans and roles that assist with tasks such as innovating care delivery models care navigation and managing care for highrisk patient pools roles in which those organizations already excel. The pharmaceutical market will naturally balance the costs of innovation across more economies if the United States negotiates prices and implements regulatory reforms. Sufficiency of incrementalism Historically incremental expansion of existing coverage mechanisms has been the traditional approach to policy development in the United States. This approach has been advocated by some in the fields of medicine health policy and public health as a more feasible means of making asymptotic progress toward universal coverage.32 In particular the argument has been made that SP reform legislation has not succeeded so far because it is not a realistic or achievable goal and that smaller reforms with a greater likelihood of adoption are preferable.32 However evidence shows that other countries have had successful transitions to systems that provide universal coverage or have nationalized health care financing through single large coordinated legislative efforts.3673 Moreover a recent U.S. survey showed that similar levels of debtors a majority before and after the implementation of the ACA had medical expenses contribute to or cause their debt suggesting that incremental reforms have not fixed this problem of social and economic disparities in access.74 Alternative StrategiesSince the passage of the ACA in 2010 the landscape of health care reform has been fundamentally altered. The ACA was ambitious in its goal of increasing rates of insurance coverage attempting to bend the curve of rising health care costs and improve the quality of health care. Under the ACA the rate of uninsurance reached a historic low of 8.8 in 2016 largely due to expanding Medicaid to include an additional 12 million people who receive insurance through Medicaid.75 After adjustment for inflation annual NHE all sources grew at a rate of 2.7 from 2003 to 2010 and 2.8 from 2010 to 2018 indicating that the ACA has not made substantial inroads into improving health care spending.76We also know that the scope of coverage with regard to innetwork behavioral health services became more comprehensive from 2013 to 2014. This reflects the positive change that occurred when the ACA and the parity requirements went into effect. Coverage appeared to improve when insurance companies reduced their exclusion lists for behavioral health conditions.77 In addition knowledge of benefits returned from enhanced coverage of behavioral health conditions remains a key piece of the puzzle for optimization of the existing ACA coverage mandate.31 As far as improving quality of care the ACA also launched the Hospital Readmission Reduction Program which incentivizes higherquality care in order to reduce readmission rates at hospitals.76 However some studies have questioned whether this program reduces readmissions at all let alone improving quality of care.78 It has been suggested that many of the successes of the ACA have come from increasing access to insurance. However at the same time that Medicaid has expanded the proliferation of highcost insurance plans has grown as well. Health insurance premiums increased 4.6 in 2017 and 2018 relative to a 2.6 median increase among OECD countries.1275 According to a 2016 survey 45 of uninsured respondents identified cost of care as the reason they did not have coverage.74 In addition 44 of people with marketplace plans are considered underinsured due to the high cost of outofpocket expenses such as deductibles.75 In fact the average deductible for a silver plan on HealthCare.gov increased from 2425 in 2014 to 4500 in 2020.76 Waiting for future incremental gains based on the ACA provides an insufficient path toward universal health coverage. Prior to the ACA studies estimated that almost 45000 Americans died each year due to lack of insurance.79 A more recent review of available evidence concluded that the odds of death among people with insurance were between 0.71 and 0.97 relative to those without insurance.80 With the number of uninsured people expected to reach 31 million by 2020 any delay in achieving universal coverage will cause unnecessary and unacceptable mortality. Not only are incremental approaches to universal health care too slow but they are also politically vulnerable as exemplified by the ACA. There have been more than 50 attempts to repeal the ACA in the House of Representatives since the passage of the law.81 In addition many of the potential gains of the ACA have been undermined by states using work requirements to reduce Medicaid eligibility.81 While unsuccessful there have also been many legal challenges to the law that have gone to the Supreme Court which could potentially overturn the ACA. Action Steps APHA joins other national and international organizations in declaring that health care is a human right. Furthermore APHA holds that a national SP plan is the optimal design for simultaneously improving health and lowering the cost of care in the United States. Therefore APHA joins Physicians for a National Health Program Public Citizen the Congressional Black Caucus the American College of Physicians the American Medical Association s Medical Student Section the American Medical Student Association the American Medical Women s Association the American Nurses Association and other national and international organizations in calling for legislation and administrative policy reforms to implement a national SP system.  2.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/468401/majority-say-gov-ensure-healthcare.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. A 57 majority of U.S. adults believe that the federal government should ensure all Americans have healthcare coverage. Yet nearly as many 53 prefer that the U.S. healthcare system be based on private insurance rather than run by the government. These findings are in line with recent attitudes about the government s involvement in the healthcare system which have been relatively steady since 2015. In 2000 Gallup began tracking the public s views of whether it is the federal government s responsibility to ensure all Americans have healthcare coverage and has found considerable fluctuation. From 2000 through 2008 majorities ranging from 54 to 69 believed the federal government should ensure universal coverage in the U.S. In 2009 thenPresident Barack Obama s administration worked with Congress to pass the Affordable Care Act ACA which expanded access to private health insurance via new government mandates and subsidies. The bill was ultimately signed into law in March 2010 and until 2012 the public was divided in their attitudes about the government s obligation for healthcare coverage in the U.S. From 2012 through 2014 clear majorities said this was not the government s responsibility. In 2015 the tide again turned and a slim majority felt healthcare coverage was a government obligation. Since then between 51 and 57 of Americans have held this view. The latest findings from Gallup s annual Health and Healthcare poll conducted Nov. 9Dec. 2 2022 show 57 think the government should be responsible to ensure coverage for all Americans while 40 say it should not. Partisans views of the federal government s responsibility in ensuring healthcare for all Americans diverge sharply as they have over the past two decades. Currently 88 of Democrats and 59 of independents but just 28 of Republicans think the government is responsible. While an average 79 of Democrats since 2001 have asserted the government s obligation to ensure healthcare for all in the U.S. an average 71 of Republicans over the same period have said the opposite. A 56 average of independents have said it is a governmental obligation. At the same time that Americans see a government role in ensuring universal U.S. healthcare coverage they prefer that the nation s healthcare system be based on private insurance rather than run by the government. Currently 53 of U.S. adults prefer a private system while 43 support a governmentrun system. Since 2010 when the measure was first tracked the public has consistently favored private insurance with just one exception In 2017 U.S. adults were evenly divided in their preferences. Partisans preferences for the U.S. healthcare system differ sharply with 72 of Democrats in favor of a governmentrun system and 83 of Republicans a private system. Independents tilt slightly toward a private 50 rather than a governmentrun 46 system. Over the past 13 years the percentage of Republicans preferring private insurance has not fallen below 79 it peaked at 91 in 2010 the year the ACA became law. At the same time between 52 in 2013 and 77 in 2021 of Democrats have favored a governmentrun system. Majorities of independents backed a private system from 2010 through 2015 but they have been more divided since then reaching a consensus only once in 2021 when 55 favored private insurance. Americans continue to hold a nuanced view of the U.S. healthcare system with a majority saying the government should ensure that all Americans have coverage but preferring that the system be funded privately. Partisans have fundamentally differing views on how healthcare should be delivered in the U.S. with Democrats indicating support for a system where the government not only guarantees coverage but provides healthcare while Republicans remain wedded to the current system of private coverage and healthcare. Notably Democrats are more unified in their belief that government is responsible for ensuring all Americans have healthcare than in wanting a true public health system. Conversely Republicans are more unified against such medical care than they are against the idea that it is government s job to make sure no American goes without healthcare.
