https://www.boundless.com/blog/biden-immigration-tracker/, For BusinessesImmigration help for your business News ReportsAbout UsLog InThe State of Immigration 2024 Mar 8 2024 Joe Biden assumed the presidency with a clear mandate to address the United States deeply flawed immigration system quickly overturning some of his predecessor s most controversial policies such as the ban on immigrants from Muslimmajority countries. He introduced a bold agenda that promised an 8year pathway to citizenship for approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants marking the most comprehensive and ambitious immigration reform proposal by any president in recent memory. This initiative was a beacon of hope signaling a move towards more inclusive and humane immigration policies. However the journey from ambitious campaign promises to pragmatic governance has been complex navigating through policy reform economic imperatives and political turbulence.  The president s recent use of the term illegal to describe undocumented individuals during his State of the Union address starkly contrasts with these initial efforts particularly given his administration s 2021 push towards more respectful language by advising U.S. immigration enforcement agencies to avoid terms like illegal alien. This moment of discord has not only drawn criticism but also highlighted how polarizing the issue of immigration has become over Biden s term reflecting a significant shift whether by choice or necessity from his administration s inclusive and ambitious start. The evolution of Biden s immigration policy mirrors the nation s grappling with one of its most polarizing issues amidst a landscape marked by economic recovery and labor market dynamics underscoring the challenges of balancing ambitious reform with the realities of governing in a divided country. However the reality of governing a country facing an unprecedented surge at the southern border required a reevaluation of these stances. The administration s early promises ran headlong into logistical and political challenges from overcrowded detention facilities to a surge in migrant crossings that tested the nation s capacity for asylum processing. Amidst growing public concern and political pressure the administration shifted its rhetoric seeking a more centrist path that balanced humanitarian concerns with border security and enforcement. As the 2024 election looms the political landscape sees a familiar rivalry rekindled between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump with immigration emerging as a central battleground. Trump has doubled down on his hardline immigration stance proposing measures that far exceed the scope of his previous policies. These developments underscore a stark contrast in the vision for America s future with immigration at the heart of the discourse. The contrasting immigration policies of Trump and Biden not only reflect differing political ideologies but also carry profound implications for the U.S. economy and labor market. Immigrants play a crucial role in filling labor shortages driving economic growth and contributing to the diversity and dynamism of American society.  Immigrants both documented and undocumented have been key to filling labor shortages across various sectors from healthcare to agriculture contributing to the U.S. s robust economic recovery from the pandemic. Nearly 19 of the labor force is now composed of foreignborn workers reflecting the vital role of immigrants in sustaining American businesses and driving economic growth. The influx of immigrants has also been linked to moderating inflationary pressures with the participation of foreignborn workers helping to stabilize wages and prices in a historically tight labor market. This economic impact underscored by analyses indicating that immigration could contribute approximately 7 trillion to the U.S. economy over the next decade challenges narratives that pit immigrants against nativeborn workers in zerosum competition for jobs and wages. In the wake of President Joe Biden s State of the Union address and the ensuing discourse the administration s path forward on immigration emerges as a critical juncture in defining his presidency s legacy and future trajectory. Amidst the backdrop of a slip in rhetoric and the broader challenges of policy reform economic imperatives and political turbulence the administration s commitment to a humane and inclusive approach to immigration remains under scrutiny. As the nation stands at this crossroads the imperative to balance the foundational humanity that characterized the early days of Biden s immigration policy with the strategic unlocking of the skilled labor force becomes increasingly apparent. This balance is not merely a matter of policy preference but a crucial lever for sustaining and amplifying the economic gains achieved under Biden s leadership. The administration s ability to navigate this balance will be pivotal in securing a robust economic future for the United States. The critical role of immigrants in addressing labor shortages across key sectors from healthcare to agriculture cannot be overstated. As essential contributors to the nation s recovery and growth immigrants have proven indispensable in filling gaps in the labor market driving innovation and fostering a dynamic economic landscape. The participation of foreignborn workers has also played a role in moderating inflationary pressures further underscoring the economic rationale for a more open and efficient immigration system. Looking ahead the administration s efforts to refine its immigration strategy must focus on creating pathways that facilitate the entry and integration of skilled and essential workers and reflect the nation s values of dignity respect and opportunity for all. This approach entails a commitment to streamlining immigration processes removing unnecessary barriers and ensuring that America remains a destination for talent hard work and dreams. As President Biden prepares for the challenges and opportunities the administration s success in marrying the principles of humanity with pragmatic economic strategies will be critical. By doing so Biden can continue to build on the economic gains of his tenure enhance America s competitive edge on the global stage and reaffirm the country s identity as a beacon of hope and opportunity. In navigating the complexities of immigration reform the administration can craft a legacy reflecting the best of American values while securing the nation s economic prosperity for future generations.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/611135/immigration-surges-top-important-problem-list.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Significantly more Americans name immigration as the most important problem facing the U.S. 28 than did a month ago 20. Immigration has now passed the government as the most often cited problem after the two issues tied for the top position the past two months. The government ranked first each month from January through November 2023. In the latest poll 20 of Americans name the government as the most important problem followed by the economy 12 and inflation 11. Immigration is the only issue that has shown meaningful change in the past month. The latest results are based on a Feb. 120 Gallup survey. Immigration has ranked ahead of all other issues as the most important problem before having last done so five years ago when there was a surge of attempted border crossings by Central American migrants. Immigration also ranked as the No. 1 problem in July and November 2018 and July 2014. Gallup started compiling mentions of immigration in 1981. The 28 currently naming immigration as the most important problem essentially ties the 27 reading from July 2019 as the highest in Gallup s trend. The latest survey was conducted at a time when a bipartisan group of congressional senators reached an agreement on an immigration reform proposal. The bill ultimately failed to pass a Senate vote but it faced an uncertain fate in the Republicanled House of Representatives even if it had passed. The House passed a tougher immigration bill in 2023 that the Democraticled Senate has not taken up and President Joe Biden promised to veto. The recent bipartisan negotiations took place in response to a record number of border crossings at the southern border in recent months peaking at over 300000 in December. An influx of migrants in U.S. cities has also stressed social services there. Republicans typically are the subgroup most likely to name immigration as the most important problem and they are largely responsible for the increase in mentions this month. Currently 57 of Republicans up from 37 in January say immigration is the top problem. Independents show a modest uptick from 16 in January to 22 now while there has been no meaningful change among Democrats 9 in January and 10 in February. Residents of the East 36 and South 31 are more likely to say immigration is the biggest U.S. problem than are those living in the Midwest 25 and West 22. Southern residents have typically been most likely to regard immigration as the top issue. A separate question in the survey finds a recordhigh 55 of U.S. adults up eight points from last year saying that large numbers of immigrants entering the United States illegally is a critical threat to U.S. vital interests. The prior high was 50 in 2004. The vast majority of Republicans already believed illegal immigration was a critical threat 84 said so a year ago but the percentage has now reached 90. A larger increase from 40 to 54 has been seen among independents. Far fewer Democrats view illegal immigration as a critical threat but that percentage is up from 20 in 2023 to 29. Perhaps related to its unsuccessful efforts on immigration and a foreign aid package Congress job approval rating has fallen to 12. This is the lowest Congress approval rating has been since it was 11 in November 2015 although there have been several 13 readings in that period including last October. The alltime low reading for Congress is 9 registered in November 2013 after a government shutdown in a dispute over funding the Affordable Care Act. Congress job rating has consistently been below 20 since July and in the current session which began in January 2023 it has only reached 21. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the House of Representatives while Democrats have a narrow majority in the Senate. On Feb. 13 the House by one vote approved impeachment articles against Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas over his department s failure to secure the U.S. border. That vote was the House s second attempt to impeach Mayorkas after the first attempt on Feb. 6 failed. Fourteen percent of Democrats 12 of independents and 9 of Republicans approve of the job Congress is doing. Congressional approval has fallen meaningfully among independents in the past month from 18. Democrats and Republicans approval ratings are similar to or the same as in January 15 and 9 respectively. The February poll also included Gallup s monthly update of Americans economic sentiments. These assessments remain more negative than positive but have become considerably less dour in recent months. Currently 26 of U.S. adults describe current economic conditions as excellent or good while 32 say they are only fair and 41 poor. The poor rating is down slightly from 45 in January and has not been lower since January 2022 when it was 37. When asked whether the economy is getting better or worse 32 say it is improving and 61 worsening. However the 32 who believe the economy is getting better is the highest Gallup has measured since September 2021. Gallup s Economic Confidence Index which summarizes current economic evaluations and perceptions of whether the economy is improving is 22 a nearly 20point improvement since October s 41 reading. It is the highest the index has been since September 2021 the month before the inflation rate surpassed 6. All party groups have been more positive about the economy since October though the confidence levels still vary greatly among these groups. Since October the index has increased 24 points among Democrats from 0 to 24 14 points among independents from 43 to 29 and nine points among Republicans from 72 to 63. Improved economic evaluations have done little to brighten Americans overall mood as 19 are satisfied and 79 dissatisfied with the way things are going in the United States. These ratings have been highly stable in recent months with satisfaction ranging between 18 and 22 since May. Similarly Biden s job approval rating does not seem to be helped by the economy 38 approve of the way he is handling his job. Biden s performance on the immigration issue may be keeping his overall rating down as he receives a personal low of 28 for his handling of immigration at the same time that the issue has become more salient to the public. While many Americans regard the economy generally or inflation specifically as the most important problem facing the U.S. far more name immigration. Immigration now sits alone at the top of the most important problem list something it has done only occasionally in Gallup s trend and not since 2019. Although their economic assessments have improved Americans remain largely dissatisfied with the state of the nation and the job federal leaders are doing.

John MooreGetty Images hide caption   Texas National Guard soldiers are seen guarding the U.S.Mexico border in Eagle Pass Texas. A whirlwind of court orders on Tuesday briefly allowed then blocked again a controversial new immigration law in Texas that would allow state and local law enforcement to arrest and deport people who are in the state illegally.  The Biden administration has objected to the law known as Senate Bill 4 saying that the Constitution and legal precedent establish that the federal government has the exclusive power to enforce immigration law.  For several hours the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the law to be enforced. But then close to midnight a lower court put the law back on hold and scheduled a lastminute hearing on Wednesday morning.  At the hearing a threejudge panel questioned the Texas solicitor general about details of the law and heard arguments from the U.S. Department of Justice and the ACLU about why it should be struck down.  The law remains on hold while the appeals court deliberates.  Senate Bill 4 is a Texas law passed late last year that empowers state and local law enforcement agencies to enforce immigration law. Texas Republicans who championed the legislation say its a response to the Biden administrations border policies which they have criticized as being too permissive.  Its important because it helps address what even the president has called a border crisis said Texas solicitor general Aaron Nielson at Wednesdays hearing.  The bill was originally set to go into effect on March 5. But the U.S. government and the ACLU both filed lawsuits against it and a district judge issued a preliminary injunction to block the law from enforcement while the case was being heard.  Texas appealed the injunction to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeals court turned to the Supreme Court which ultimately allowed the law to go into effect on Tuesday before the appeals court blocked it. The Supreme Court did not issue an opinion clarifying whether the majority had supported the merits of the law or if it simply viewed its decision as a procedural one. Now the Wednesday hearing at the Fifth Circuit considered the question of whether to allow the district judges preliminary injunction to take effect thereby continuing to block SB 4 from enforcement. The Biden administration has argued that Texas overstepped its constitutional limits in passing SB 4 and they maintain that immigration policy and law enforcement are exclusive functions of the federal government.  Critics of SB 4 have cast the law as Texas attempt to take over those law enforcement capabilities a notion that Nielson disputed at Wednesdays hearing. Thats really not true he told the panel. What Texas wants to do is to be able to coordinate with the federal government. Federal attorneys meanwhile have repeatedly pointed to a 2012 Supreme Court decision known as Arizona vs. United States a case about a state law in Arizona that sought to create statelevel crimes for immigration offenses and empower local law enforcement to check citizenship status and arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally. In a 53 decision the court sided with the federal government and struck down most of Arizonas law.  Because the Texas law goes further than Arizona Department of Justice attorney Daniel Tenny argued Wednesday SB 4s provisions should too be blocked. This is more at the heart at the area that the court has consistently recognized is reserved for the national government he said.  Groups that advocate for civil rights and immigrants rights have criticized the law over concerns that it could lead to racial profiling. SB 4 would allow law enforcement officers to question someones immigration status for any reason.  We know that this law is going to increase racial profiling. We know that this law is going to strip people of their constitutional rights. We know that this law is also going to lead to the mass criminalization of our communities said Alan Lizarraga a spokesperson for the Border Network for Human Rights speaking to the Texas Newsroom.  Opponents also worry that migrants with legitimate claims to asylum could have their federal cases asylum complicated by the Texas law if they come to face state criminal charges.  Mexico also opposes the law. Its foreign affairs ministry said in a statement Tuesday that the country will not accept migrants who have been deported under the Texas law. And it expressed concern for Mexican nationals living in Texas who it said could now be subject to expressions of hate discrimination and racial profiling.  With the case back at the Fifth Circuit Mexico said it plans to file a legal brief in opposition to SB 4 that lays out how the law could affect the relationship between the two countries the statement said.  Local law enforcement officers say they are prepared to enforce the law. But others have said they have not received clear guidance about how to implement it or whether theyll have resources needed to carry out arrests in large numbers.  I think were going to be very selective about the cases we pick up said Culberson County Sheriff Oscar Carillo whose jurisdiction is located along the west Texas border. Our jail is at capacity as we speak today and to start incarcerating undocumented people and charging them a misdemeanor crime is a discussion Ill have to have with my county attorney he told the Texas Newsroom on Tuesday.  Wednesdays appeals court hearing revealed the extent to which details of the laws enforcement have yet to be hammered out. Nielson the Texas solicitor general struggled to answer a series of questions from Chief Judge Priscilla Richman about how various scenarios would play out.  For instance when Richman asked how the law would be applied to a person who entered the U.S. illegally through another border state before moving to Texas Nielson replied I confess your honor I dont know.

https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-issues-final-rule-to-adjust-certain-immigration-and-naturalization-fees, Official websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. WASHINGTON Today U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS published a final rule to adjust certain immigration and naturalization benefit request fees for the first time since 2016. The final rule will allow USCIS to recover a greater share of its operating costs and support more timely processing of new applications. The final rule is the result of a comprehensive fee review as required by law and follows the January 2023 publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking. The review concluded that the current fee schedule falls far short in recovering the full cost of agency operations including the necessary expansion of humanitarian programs federally mandated pay raises additional staffing requirements and other essential investments.  For the first time in over seven years USCIS is updating our fees to better meet the needs of our agency enabling us to provide more timely decisions to those we serve said USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou. Despite years of inadequate funding the USCIS workforce has made great strides in customer service backlog reduction implementing new processes and programs and upholding fairness integrity and respect for all we serve.  USCIS received over 5400 unique public comments in response to its January 2023 notice of proposed rulemaking. USCIS took into consideration comments and feedback received during the proposed rulemaking process. Acknowledging this feedback from stakeholders the final fee rule includes several important updates since the initial rulemaking. The final rule Every fee in the final rule is the same or lower than in the proposed rule. For most individual filers the final rule limits how much newly established fees may increase. Under the final rule the new fees will not increase by more than 26 which is equivalent to the increase in the Consumer Price Index since the last fee rule was issued in 2016. With the new revenues the rule will generate USCIS will continue using innovative solutions to improve customer experience and stem backlog growth. Although the fee increases announced today will allow USCIS to better offset overall costs congressional funding continues to be necessary to sustainably and fully address the increased volume of caseloads associated with recent border crossers including by hiring additional USCIS personnel to help rightsize a system that was not built to manage the numbers of cases USCIS receives. The new fees under the final rule will go into effect on April 1 2024. USCIS encourages stakeholders to visit the Frequently Asked Questions page on its website to view a full list of the revised forms that will go into effect on April 1 2024 along with the new fees. USCIS will accept prior editions of most forms during a grace period from April 1 2024 through June 3 2024. During this grace period USCIS will accept both previous and new editions of certain forms filed with the correct fee. There will be no grace period for the following new forms however because they must be revised with a new fee calculation. Filers should click the links below to access a preview version of each new form edition before the April 1 2024 effective date USCIS will use the postmark date of a filing to determine which form version and fees are correct but will use the receipt date for purposes of any regulatory or statutory filing deadlines.

https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-announces-strengthened-integrity-measures-for-h-1b-program, Official websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. ALERT USCIS has extended the initial registration period for the fiscal year FY 2025 H1B cap. The initial registration period which opened at noon Eastern on March 6 2024 and was originally scheduled to run through noon Eastern on March 22 will now run through noon Eastern on March 25 2024. USCIS is aware of a temporary system outage experienced by some registrants and is extending the registration period to provide additional time due to this issue. Read more here USCIS Extends Initial Registration Period for FY 2025 H1B Cap. Announces FY 2025 H1B Cap Initial Registration Period and Online Filing of H1B Petitions WASHINGTON U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS today announced a final rule to strengthen the integrity of and reduce the potential for fraud in the H1B registration process including by reducing the potential for gaming the registration system and ensuring each beneficiary would have the same chance of being selected regardless of the number of registrations submitted on their behalf. USCIS is also announcing the initial registration period dates for the fiscal year FY 2025 H1B cap and the launch of an online filing option for Forms I129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker and Form I907 Request for Premium Processing Service for H1B petitioners.  We re always looking for ways to bolster integrity and curtail the potential for fraud while improving and streamlining our application processes said USCIS Director Ur M. Jaddou. The improvements in these areas should make H1B selections more equitable for petitioners and beneficiaries and will allow for the H1B process to be fully electronic from registration if applicable until final decision and transmission of approved petitions to the Department of State.  This final rule contains provisions that will create a beneficiarycentric selection process for registrations by employers codify start date flexibility for certain petitions subject to the congressionally mandated H1B cap and add more integrity measures related to the registration process. Under the beneficiary centric process registrations will be selected by unique beneficiary rather than by registration. This new process is designed to reduce the potential for fraud and ensure each beneficiary would have the same chance of being selected regardless of the number of registrations submitted on their behalf by an employer. Starting with the FY 2025 initial registration period USCIS will require registrants to provide valid passport information or valid travel document information for each beneficiary. The passport or travel document provided must be the one the beneficiary if or when abroad intends to use to enter the United States if issued an H1B visa. Each beneficiary must only be registered under one passport or travel document. USCIS is also clarifying requirements regarding the requested employment start date on certain petitions subject to the congressionally mandated H1B cap to permit filing with requested start dates that are after Oct. 1 of the relevant fiscal year consistent with current policy. Additionally the H1B final rule codifies USCIS ability to deny or revoke H1B petitions where the underlying registration contained a false attestation or was otherwise invalid. Also under the new rule USCIS may deny or revoke the approval of an H1B petition if it determines that the fee associated with the registration is declined not reconciled disputed or otherwise invalid after submission. USCIS has also announced the Fee Schedule final rule. That rule will go into effect after the initial registration period for the FY 2025 H1B cap. Therefore the registration fee during the registration period starting in March 2024 will remain 10. A new edition of Form I129 with the H1B Registration final rule and Fee Schedule final rule changes will soon be available to preview on uscis.gov edition date 040124. On April 1 2024 only the 040124 edition of Form I129 will be accepted. The H1B Registration final rule makes final some provisions proposed in the Oct. 23 2023 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking NPRM. Note that DHS intends to publish a separate final rule to address the remaining provisions contained in the NPRM. FY 2025 H1B Cap Initial Registration Period The initial registration period for the FY 2025 H1B cap will open at noon Eastern on March 6 2024 and run through noon Eastern on March 22 2024. During this period prospective petitioners and their representatives if applicable must use a USCIS online account to register each beneficiary electronically for the selection process and pay the associated registration fee for each beneficiary.  For more information on the H1B Cap Season visit H1B Cap Season webpage. Organizational Accounts and Online Filing for Forms I129 and I907 On Feb. 28 2024 USCIS will launch the previously announced new organizational accounts in the USCIS online account that will allow multiple people within an organization and their legal representatives to collaborate on and prepare H1B registrations H1B petitions and any associated Form I907.  Also on Feb. 28 USCIS will launch online filing of Form I129 and associated Form I907 for noncap H1B petitions. On April 1 USCIS will begin accepting online filing for H1B cap petitions and associated Forms I907 for petitioners whose registrations have been selected. Petitioners will continue to have the option of filing a paper Form I129 H1B petition and any associated Form I907 if they prefer. However during the initial launch of organizational accounts users will not be able to link paperfiled Forms I129 and I907 to their online accounts. As a reminder USCIS recently announced a final rule that will increase the filing fee for Form I907 to adjust for inflation effective Feb. 26 2024. If USCIS receives a Form I907 postmarked on or after Feb. 26 2024 with the incorrect filing fee we will reject the Form I907 and return the filing fee. For filings sent by commercial courier such as UPS FedEx and DHL the postmark date is the date reflected on the courier receipt.

STATUTORY NUMBERS FOR PREFERENCE IMMIGRANT VISAS This bulletin summarizes the availability of immigrant numbers during April for Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing Applications indicating when immigrant visa applicants should be notified to assemble and submit required documentation to the National Visa Center. Unless otherwise indicated on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS website at www.uscis.govvisabulletininfo individuals seeking to file applications for adjustment of status with USCIS must use the Final Action Dates charts below for determining when they can file such applications. When USCIS determines that there are more immigrant visas available for the fiscal year than there are known applicants for such visas USCIS will state on its website that applicants may instead use the Dates for Filing Visa Applications charts in this Bulletin.  1. Procedures for determining dates. Consular officers are required to report to the Department of State documentarily qualified applicants for numerically limited visas USCIS reports applicants for adjustment of status. Allocations in the charts below were made to the extent possible in chronological order of reported priority dates for demand received by March 4th. If not all demand could be satisfied the category or foreign state in which demand was excessive was deemed oversubscribed. The final action date for an oversubscribed category is the priority date of the first applicant who could not be reached within the numerical limits. If it becomes necessary during the monthly allocation process to retrogress a final action date supplemental requests for numbers will be honored only if the priority date falls within the new final action date announced in this bulletin. If at any time an annual limit were reached it would be necessary to immediately make the preference category unavailable and no further requests for numbers would be honored. 2. The fiscal year 2024 limit for familysponsored preference immigrants determined in accordance with Section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA is 226000. The worldwide level for annual employmentbased preference immigrants is at least 140000. Section 202 prescribes that the percountry limit for preference immigrants is set at 7 of the total annual familysponsored and employmentbased preference limits i.e. 25620. The dependent area limit is set at 2 or 7320. 3. INA Section 203e provides that familysponsored and employmentbased preference visas be issued to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition in behalf of each has been filed. Section 203d provides that spouses and children of preference immigrants are entitled to the same status and the same order of consideration if accompanying or following to join the principal. The visa prorating provisions of Section 202e apply to allocations for a foreign state or dependent area when visa issuances will exceed the percountry limit. These provisions apply at present to the following oversubscribed chargeability areas CHINAmainland born INDIA MEXICO and PHILIPPINES.  4.

L. 105139 provides that once the Employment Third Preference Other Worker EW cutoff date has reached the priority date of the latest EW petition approved prior to November 19 1997 the 10000 EW numbers available for a fiscal year are to be reduced by up to 5000 annually beginning in the following fiscal year. This reduction is to be made for as long as necessary to offset adjustments under the NACARA program. Since the EW final action date reached November 19 1997 during Fiscal Year 2001 the reduction in the EW annual limit to 5000 began in Fiscal Year 2002. For Fiscal Year 2024 this reduction will be limited to approximately 150. B. DATES FOR FILING OF EMPLOYMENTBASED VISA APPLICATIONS The chart below reflects dates for filing visa applications within a timeframe justifying immediate action in the application process.

B. DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT DV CATEGORY FOR THE MONTH OF APRIL Section 203c of the INA provides up to 55000 immigrant visas each fiscal year to permit additional immigration opportunities for persons from countries with low admissions during the previous five years. The NACARA stipulates that beginning with DV99 and for as long as necessary up to 5000 of the 55000 annually allocated diversity visas will be made available for use under the NACARA program. Visa numbers made available to NACARA applicants in FY 2023 will result in reduction of the DV2024 annual limit to approximately 54850. Section 5104 of the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for Fiscal Year 2024 amended the NACARA s provisions on the Diversity Visa program such that the number of visas made available under the NDAA will be deducted from the 55000 DVs annually allocated. These amendments will not impact the number of diversity visas available until FY 2025. DVs are divided among six geographic regions. No one country can receive more than seven percent of the available diversity visas in any one year. For April immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to qualified DV2024 applicants chargeable to all regionseligible countries as follows. When an allocation cutoff number is shown visas are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers BELOW the specified allocation cutoff number Except Iran 7000 Nepal 6000 Entitlement to immigrant status in the DV category lasts only through the end of the fiscal visa year for which the applicant is selected in the lottery. The year of entitlement for all applicants registered for the DV2024 program ends as of September 30 2024. DV visas may not be issued to DV2024 applicants after that date. Similarly spouses and children accompanying or following to join DV2024 principals are only entitled to derivative DV status until September 30 2024. DV visa availability through the very end of FY2024 cannot be taken for granted. Numbers could be exhausted prior to September 30. C. THE DIVERSITY DV IMMIGRANT CATEGORY RANK CUTOFFS WHICH WILL APPLY IN MAY For May immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to qualified DV2024 applicants chargeable to all regionseligible countries as follows. When an allocation cutoff number is shown visas are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers BELOW the specified allocation cutoff number D. SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT FOURTH PREFERENCE RELIGIOUS WORKERS SR CATEGORY Pursuant to H.R. 7463 signed on March 1 2024 the nonminister special immigrant program expires on March 22 2024. No SR visas may be issued overseas or final action taken on adjustment of status cases after midnight March 21 2024. Visas issued prior to that date will be valid only until March 21 2024 and all individuals seeking admission in the nonminister special immigrant category must be admitted repeat admitted into the United States no later than midnight March 21 2024.  The SR category is listed as Unavailable for all countries for April. In the event there is legislative action extending the category it is likely it will become available effective immediately. If extended the category will be subject to the same final action dates as the listed EmploymentBased Fourth Preference categories per applicable foreign state of chargeability. E. VISA AVAILABILITY IN THE COMING MONTHS F1 Up to three monthsF2A excluding Mexico Up to six monthsF2B Up to ten weeksF3 Several monthsF4 Up to four weeks  F1 Up to four monthsF2A Up to three monthsF2B Several monthsF3 Up to six monthsF4 Up to three months EMPLOYMENTbased categories Very little to no forward movement is expected in the coming months since the final action dates for many categories advanced for April 2024. The above final action date projections for the Family and Employment categories indicate what is likely to happen throughout Quarter Three and Quarter Four of FY24. Readers should never assume that recent trends in final action date movements are guaranteed for the future or that retrogressions will not be required at some point to maintain number use within the applicable annual limits. The determination of the actual monthly final action dates is subject to fluctuations in applicant demand and other variables.  F. U.S. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISAS SIVs The National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for Fiscal Year 2024 signed into law on December 22 2023 may affect certain current and former employees of the U.S. Government abroad applying for SIVs or adjustment of status as described in section 101a27D of the INA. This does not affect certain Iraqis and Afghans applying for SQ and SI SIVs. Applicants should contact the consular section at which they filed their Form DS 1884 for further information on the impact of that law on their case. G.

https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/alerts/uscis-reaches-h-2b-cap-for-second-half-of-fy-2024-and-announces-filing-dates-for-the-second-half-of, Official websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has received enough petitions to meet the H2B cap for the second half of fiscal year FY 2024 and is announcing the filing dates for supplemental H2B visas for the reminder of FY 2024 made available under the FY 2024 H2B supplemental visa temporary final rule. USCIS has received enough petitions to meet the congressionally mandated H2B cap for the second half of FY 2024. March 7 2024 was the final receipt date for new capsubject H2B worker petitions requesting an employment start date on or after April 1 2024 and before Oct. 1 2024. We will reject new capsubject H2B petitions received after March 7 2024 that request an employment start date on or after April 1 2024 and before Oct. 1 2024. We continue to accept H2B petitions that are exempt from the congressionally mandated cap. This includes petitions for Filing Dates for Second Half of FY 2024 Supplemental Visas The Department of Homeland Security DHS and the Department of Labor DOL jointly published a temporary final rule on Nov. 17 2023 increasing the numerical limit or cap on H2B nonimmigrant visas by up to 64716 additional visas for all of FY 2024. These supplemental visas are available only to U.S. businesses that are suffering irreparable harm or will suffer impending irreparable harm without the ability to employ all the H2B workers requested in their petition as attested by the employer on the DOL Form ETA 9142BCAA8 PDF. These supplemental H2B visas are for U.S. employers seeking to petition for additional workers at certain periods of the fiscal year. Below are the filing start dates for each of the remaining supplemental visa allocations under the temporary final rule USCIS will stop accepting petitions under this temporary final rule received after Sept. 16 2024 or after the applicable cap has been reached whichever occurs first. USCIS has already announced that we have received enough petitions to reach the cap for the additional 20716 H2B visas made available for returning workers for the first half of FY 2024 with employment start dates on or before March 31 2024. Additional information on the FY 2024 supplemental visas is available on the Temporary Increase in H2B Nonimmigrant Visas for FY 2024 page. Reminder Upcoming Changes in Required Fee and Form Editions for H2B Petitions On Jan. 30 2024 USCIS announced a final rule published in the Federal Register that adjusts the fees required for most immigration applications and petitions. The new fees will be effective April 1 2024. There will be no grace period for filing the new version of Form I129 Petition for a Nonimmigrant Worker because it must include the new fee calculation. H2B petitions postmarked on or after April 1 2024 must include the new fees and be filed on the 040124 edition of the form or we will not accept them. USCIS has published a preview version of the 040124 edition of Form I129.  An official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security 
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2024/03/07/state-of-the-union-2024-where-americans-stand-on-the-economy-immigration-and-other-key-issues/, Here s a look at public opinion on key issues facing the country drawn from recent Pew Research Center surveys of U.S. adults. This analysis looks at Americans views on a variety of national issues ahead of the annual State of the Union address. These findings primarily come from a survey of 5140 U.S. adults conducted Jan. 1621 2024. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Links to additional ATP surveys used for this analysis including information about their methodologies are available in the text. Nearly threequarters of Americans 73 say strengthening the economy should be a top priority for Biden and Congress this year according to a Center survey conducted in January. Of the 20 policy goals we asked about no other issue stands out as has been the case for the past two years. This assessment comes amid ongoing worries about high prices. Majorities of U.S. adults say they are very concerned about the price of food and consumer goods 72 and the cost of housing 64. Still views of the economy overall have warmed a bit in the past year. Slightly more than a quarter of Americans 28 rate U.S. economic conditions as excellent or good an increase of 9 percentage points since last April. This shift is driven largely by Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 44 rate the economy positively compared with just 13 of Republicans and GOP leaners. Despite these sharply different assessments majorities of both Democrats 63 and Republicans 84 say strengthening the economy should be a top policy goal this year. These shares are largely unchanged since last year. About sixinten Americans 57 say dealing with immigration should be a top policy goal for the president and Congress this year a share that s increased 18 points from 39 since the start of Biden s term. This change is almost entirely due to growing concern among Republicans 76 now say immigration should be a top priority up from 39 in 2021. By comparison the 39 of Democrats who cite immigration as a priority has remained fairly stable since 2021. Related Latinos Views on the Migrant Situation at the U.S.Mexico Border The growing number of migrant encounters at the southern border has emerged as a key issue in the 2024 election cycle. Biden and former President Donald Trump who is running for the Republican presidential nomination both visited the border on Feb. 29. Eightinten U.S. adults say the federal government is doing a bad job dealing with the large number of migrants at the U.S.Mexico border including 45 who say it s doing a very bad job according to our January survey. Republicans and Democrats alike fault the federal government for its handling of the border situation 89 and 73 respectively say it s doing a bad job. The survey also asked Americans to react to nine potential policies that could address the situation at the border and found broadly positive views of several. Half or more of U.S. adults say the following would make the situation better Fewer than twointen say any of these proposals would make the situation worse. About sixinten U.S. adults say defending the country from future terrorist attacks 63 and reducing crime 58 should be political priorities this year. But Republicans place more emphasis on these issues than Democrats. Republicans concerns about terrorism have risen 11 points since last year 76 now say it should be a top policy priority up from 65 then. By comparison about half of Democrats 51 say defending against terrorism should be a priority this year while 55 said this last year. Concerns about crime have risen somewhat in both parties since the start of Biden s presidency. About seveninten Republicans 68 say reducing crime should be a top priority this year up 13 points since 2021. And 47 of Democrats say the same up 8 points since 2021. As Biden urges Congress to pass emergency foreign aid about threequarters of Americans see the war between Israel and Hamas 75 the tensions between China and Taiwan 75 and the war between Russia and Ukraine 74 as somewhat or very important to U.S. national interests according to a separate Center survey from January. Democrats and Republicans are about equally likely to see the IsraelHamas war and ChinaTaiwan tensions as important to national interests. But Democrats are more likely than Republicans to describe the war in Ukraine this way 81 vs. 69. In a late 2023 survey 48 of Republicans said the U.S. was giving too much support to Ukraine while just 16 of Democrats said the same. This partisan gap has grown steadily wider since the beginning of the war. Related Americans Views of the IsraelHamas War About sixinten Americans 62 including similar shares of Democrats 65 and Republicans 60 say reducing the influence of money in politics should be a top policy goal this year.  Most Americans 72 favor spending limits for political campaigns according to a July 2023 Center survey. Eightinten also say major campaign donors have too much influence over decisions that members of Congress make while 73 say lobbyists and special interest groups have too much influence. And 81 of Americans including majorities in both parties rate members of Congress poorly when it comes to keeping their personal financial interests separate from their work as public servants. Democrats are much more likely than Republicans to say protecting the environment 63 vs. 23 and dealing with climate change 59 vs. 12 should be top policy priorities for 2024. In fact addressing climate change ranks last on Republicans list of priorities this year. Views of the Biden administration s current climate policies also differ sharply by party. Eightinten Democrats say the federal government is doing too little to reduce the effects of climate change compared with 29 of Republicans according to a Center survey from spring 2023. Overall a majority of U.S. adults 67 support prioritizing the development of renewable energy such as wind and solar over expanding the production of oil coal and natural gas. But Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to prefer this 90 vs. 42. Still the public overall is hesitant about a full energy transition Just 31 say the U.S. should phase out fossil fuels completely.

A federal appeals court late Tuesday night stopped a state law allowing Texas police to arrest people suspected of illegally crossing the TexasMexico border hours after the U.S. Supreme Court had allowed it to go into effect. Earlier in the day the high court had allowed the law to go into effect after it sent the case back to the appeals court urging it to issue a ruling promptly. The appeals court soon scheduled a hearing for Wednesday morning. And on the night before hearing oral arguments the appeals court issued an order to let a lower courts earlier injunction stopping Senate Bill 4 stand according to a filing. The Supreme Court earlier Tuesday let SB 4 go into effect but stopped short of ruling on the laws constitutionality which has been challenged by the Biden administration. Steve Vladeck a University of Texas at Austin law professor said the backandforth is indefensibly chaotic.   Even if that means SB 4 remains paused indefinitely hopefully everyone can agree that this kind of judicial whiplash is bad for everyone he said. SB 4 seeks to make illegally crossing the border a Class B misdemeanor carrying a punishment of up to six months in jail. Repeat offenders could face a seconddegree felony with a punishment of two to 20 years in prison. The law also requires state judges to order migrants returned to Mexico if they are convicted local law enforcement would be responsible for transporting migrants to the border. A judge could drop the charges if a migrant agrees to return to Mexico voluntarily. The high court s move drew a swift denouncement from some Mexican officials praise from Texas Republicans who counted it as a victory albeit temporary and concern from immigrant rights advocates. The reactions were dated by 10 p.m. Tuesday when the appellate court issued its order marking the latest development in a whirlwind 24 hours since the Supreme Court had extended a temporary block of SB 4 only to reverse course Tuesday. The Biden administration and immigrant rights organizations have sued Texas claiming SB 4 is unconstitutional because it interferes with federal immigration laws a role federal courts have said falls under the federal government s purview. In February U.S. District Judge David Ezra in Austin blocked SB 4 saying the law threatens the fundamental notion that the United States must regulate immigration with one voice. Attorney General Ken Paxton s office immediately appealed the ruling to the U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals which reversed Ezra s ruling. The Biden administration then appealed to the Supreme Court which temporarily blocked the law until March 18 as it considered the federal government s request to stop the law from going into effect. In December the American Civil Liberties Union the ACLU of Texas and the Texas Civil Rights Project sued Texas on behalf of El Paso County and two immigrant rights organizations El Pasobased Las Americas Immigrant Advocacy Center and Austinbased American Gateways over the new state law. The following month the U.S. Department of Justice filed its lawsuit against Texas. The lawsuits have since been combined. Last week the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the National Immigration Law Center also filed a lawsuit on behalf of La Union del Pueblo Entero an advocacy group in the Rio Grande Valley founded by farmer rights activists C sar Ch vez and Dolores Huerta.

https://www.uscis.gov/newsroom/news-releases/uscis-announces-availability-of-additional-h-2b-visas-for-fiscal-year-2024, Official websites use .govA .gov website belongs to an official government organization in the United States. WASHINGTON Today the Department of Homeland Security DHS through the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS and the Department of Labor DOL published a temporary final rule making available an additional 64716 H2B temporary nonagricultural worker visas for fiscal year FY 2024 on top of the statutory cap of 66000 H2B visas that are available each fiscal year. American businesses in industries such as hospitality and tourism landscaping seafood processing and more turn to seasonal and other temporary workers in the H2B program to help them meet demand from consumers. The supplemental visa allocation will help address the need for these workers in areas where too few U.S. workers are available helping contribute to the American economy. The temporary final rule also advances the Biden Administration s pledge under the Los Angeles Declaration for Migration and Protection to expand lawful pathways as an alternative to irregular migration.  By making these supplemental visas available at the outset of FY 2024 the Departments will help ensure U.S. businesses with workforce needs are able to plan ahead and find the seasonal and temporary workers they need. At the same time DHS and DOL are reinforcing robust protections for U.S. and foreign workers alike including by ensuring that employers first seek out and recruit American workers for the jobs to be filled as the H2B program requires and that foreign workers hired are protected from unscrupulous employers. Recently both DHS and DOL proposed regulations to further strengthen worker protections in the H2A and H2B visa programs and the White Houseled H2B Worker Protection Taskforce released a report PDF detailing new actions to be taken by Federal agencies to strengthen protections for vulnerable H2B and similarly situated U.S. workers.  The H2B supplemental includes an allocation of 20000 visas to workers from Colombia Costa Rica Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Haiti and Honduras. This countryspecific allocation is part of the BidenHarris Administration s efforts to build a safe orderly and humane immigration system that includes expanding lawful pathways for migration while strengthening consequences for those without a legal basis to remain in the United States. In addition to the 20000 countryspecific allocation 44716 supplemental visas will be available to returning workers who received H2B visas or were otherwise granted H2B status during one of the last three fiscal years. The rule allocates these supplemental visas for returning workers between the first half and second half of the fiscal year to account for the need for additional seasonal and other temporary workers over the course of the year with a portion of the second half allocation reserved to meet the demand for workers during the summer season. The semiannual cap of 33000 H2B visas authorized under the Immigration and Nationality Act statutory cap for the first half of FY 2024 was reached on October 11 2023. The supplemental H2B visas have been divided into the following allocations First half of FY 2024 October 1 to March 31 20716 visas are immediately available to returning workers those who were issued H2B visas or held H2B status in FY 2021 FY 2022 or FY 2023 regardless of country of nationality. These petitions must request employment start dates on or before March 31 2024. Early second half of FY 2024 April 1 to May 14 19000 visas are limited to returning workers those who were issued H2B visas or held H2B status in FY 2021 FY 2022 or FY 2023 regardless of country of nationality. These early second half of FY 2024 petitions must request employment start dates from April 1 2024 to May 14 2024.  Late second half of FY 2024 May 15 to September 30 5000 visas are limited to returning workers those who were issued H2B visas or held H2B status in FY 2021 FY 2022 or FY 2023 regardless of country of nationality. These late second half of FY 2024 petitions must request employment start dates from May 15 2024 to Sept. 30 2024. For the entirety of FY 2024 20000 visas are reserved for nationals of El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Haiti Colombia Ecuador and Costa Rica regardless of whether such nationals are returning workers. Employers requesting an employment start date in the first half of FY 2024 may file such petitions immediately after the publication of this temporary final rule.  The H2B program permits employers to temporarily hire noncitizens to perform nonagricultural labor or services in the United States. The employment must be of a temporary nature such as a onetime occurrence seasonal need or intermittent need. Employers seeking H2B workers must take a series of steps to test the U.S. labor market. They must obtain certification from DOL that there are not enough U.S. workers who are able willing qualified and available to perform the temporary work for which they seek a prospective foreign worker and that employing H2B workers will not adversely affect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers. The maximum period of stay in H2B classification is three years. A person who has held H2B nonimmigrant status for a total of three years must depart and remain outside of the United States for an uninterrupted period of three months before seeking readmission as an H2B nonimmigrant. DHS and DOL are committed to protecting all H2B workers from exploitation and abuse and to ensuring consistent with law that employers do not refuse to hire or appropriately recruit U.S. workers who are able willing qualified and available to perform the temporary work. The temporary final rule implementing this allocation features several provisions to protect both U.S. and H2B workers.  Petitions requesting supplemental allocations under this rule must be filed at the USCIS Texas Service Center. Petitions filed under the supplemental allocations in this rule at any location other than the Texas Service Center will be rejected and the filing fees will be returned.

John MooreGetty Images CNN Mexico is warning a federal US court that if its judges permit a controversial Texas immigration law to take effect the two nations would experience substantial tension that would have farreaching consequences for USMexico relations.   In a friendofthecourt brief filed Thursday with the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals lawyers for Mexico said relations with the US would be strained.   Enforcement of SB 4 would inappropriately burden the uniform and predictable sovereigntosovereign relations between Mexico and the United States by criminalizing the unauthorized entry of noncitizens into Texas from outside the county and creating diverging removal requirements between and among individual states and the national government they wrote in the brief.   Enforcement of SB 4 would also interfere with Mexico s right to determine its own policies regarding entry into its territory undermine U.S.Mexico collaboration on a legal migration framework and border management and hinder U.S.Mexico trade the attorneys told the court.   Signed into law by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in December the law makes entering Texas illegally a state crime and allows state judges to order immigrants to be deported. US immigration enforcement generally is a function of the federal government.   The 5th Circuit is currently considering whether to allow Texas to enforce Senate Bill 4 while it weighs the larger question of whether the law violates the US Constitution. A threejudge panel at the appeals court put the law back on hold late Tuesday after the Supreme Court cleared the way for it to go into effect for a short period earlier that day.   Briefs like the one filed by Mexico which is technically called an amicus brief are submitted by nonparties to offer a court expertise and information on a pending case. The decision to allow for amicus briefs comes under a court s discretion. Some amici might file their briefs in support of a particular party or in support of neither party.   Mexico said it was backing the law s challengers which include the Biden administration. Its attorneys argued in Thursday s brief that the law if allowed to take effect will be applied in a discriminatory manner.   Mexico s 11 consulates in Texas have been ordered to provide protection and guidance and have made legal support available for any Mexican nationals across the state who starts to have a problem under the new law Mexican Foreign Minister Alicia Barcena said earlier Thursday.   This law is deeply unconstitutional Barcena said arguing that immigration issues in the US are under federal jurisdiction just like in Mexico.   So we are not going to allow any action by the state of Texas neither the authorities nor the police nor anyone who acts on immigration matters at a state level at the county level this is a federal matter and for us too. So we are there the minister said. 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/03/27/texas-immigration-law-federal-appeals-court/, The 21 decision late Tuesday by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit follows a lowercourt ruling in February that said the state law is probably unconstitutional. In the majority decision the circuit s chief judge Priscilla Richman wrote that Congress left no room in U.S. law for state officials to intrude on immigration enforcement even as she sympathized with Texas s predicament as a border state amid a historic influx of migrants. Responding to illegal immigration is the federal government s role she wrote.  Texas nobly and admirably some would say seeks to fill at least partially the gaping void Richman a conservative nominated by President George W. Bush wrote in a 50page decision with Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez a Biden nominee. But it is unlikely that Texas can step into the shoes of the national sovereign under our Constitution and laws.  The decision follows legal skirmishes over the new state law known as Senate Bill 4. The Supreme Court briefly allowed the law to take effect last week and urged the appeals court to rule quickly on whether to suspend it pending legal challenges. The appeals decision is a preliminary step focusing only on Texas s request that the judges stay a Feb. 29 lowercourt ruling by U.S. District Judge David A. Ezra a Republican appointee in Austin. Ezra issued a preliminary injunction halting the law saying it intruded more into federal powers over immigration than did an Arizona immigration law that the Supreme Court partly struck down in 2012. The same threejudge appeals court panel based in New Orleans will hear Texas s request to overturn Ezra s injunction April 3 which is likely to raise the same legal arguments. Texas officials did not immediately respond to the ruling Wednesday and it was unclear if they would appeal it. Lawyers said Texas could appeal Tuesday s decision to the full 5th Circuit or to the Supreme Court. Or the state could wait to appeal the decision after next week s hearing. The office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott R did not respond to requests for comment but the governor posted on X that nearly 200 soldiers in the Texas Tactical Border Force had arrived in El Paso on Tuesday.  Texas will continue to utilize all available resources and personnel to secure our border he wrote. The dissenting judge on the appeals panel worried that the Texas law will never take effect after two court decisions cited more than a century of Supreme Court rulings that the federal government controls immigration.  Today s decision means that we ll likely never know how Texas s state courts and its state lawenforcement officers would have implemented S.B. 4 Judge Andrew Oldham a Trump nominee and Abbott s former general counsel wrote in a 71page dissent. Oldham wrote that the appeals panel will presumably affirm Ezra s ruling after next week s hearing and return the case to the lower court for a trial where the Texas law will probably be permanently blocked.  So absent intervention by the en banc court or the Supreme Court that will be that Oldham wrote. Oldham said the court should have allowed Texas to enforce the law to examine how it works. Texas argued that the state law complemented federal law rather than conflicted with it.  In our federal system the State of Texas is supposed to retain at least some of its sovereignty Oldham wrote. The court panel s majority said the Texas law irreparably conflicts with federal law. Deportations are civil proceedings where Texas makes them criminal proceedings. The state also could deport people without giving them and federal officials a chance to sort out if they could legally stay in the United States to seek asylum or another protection. The judges in the majority also criticized Congress saying that one root cause for the lack of action by the Executive could well be the failure of Congress to spend the funds necessary to address the massive increases in the numbers of noncitizens illegally entering the United States.  Oldham also cited research by Harvard law professor Gerald Neuman noting that historically U.S. states have exercised some control over immigration. But Neuman said in a phone interview Wednesday that those conditions were a long time ago before the Civil War when Southern states wanted to control the movement of free and enslaved Black people. Congress began regulating immigration through a law passed in 1875. Thomas Saenz president and general counsel of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund one of the organizations that sued to block a 2010 state immigration law in Arizona said that unless a higher court intervenes it could take years before the Texas case is decided. There is no guarantee that the Supreme Court will take it up he said. The court in 2012 partially struck down Arizona s law for similar reasons and a later court settlement considerably narrowed the law s reach he said. Texas Republicans passed the S.B. 4 law last year after accusing President Biden of weak border enforcement. U.S. authorities have apprehended an average of 2 million migrants a year who crossed the U.S.Mexico border illegally since Biden took office the highest the Border Patrol has ever recorded. Democrats have countered that Republicans are refusing to pass a bipartisan Senate bill that would address the influx by expanding enforcement. The Biden administration has accused Republicans of stalling in response to former president Donald Trump an immigration hardliner who denounced the bill and is the likely Republican nominee to challenge Biden in November s presidential election. The Texas law makes it a crime for a noncitizen to enter the state illegally from another country. Migrants convicted of violating the law could face up to six months in jail while those who return after having been deported could face felony charges and a maximum of 20 years in prison. The law also authorizes state judges to order deportations to Mexico. President Andr s Manuel L pez Obrador however has said his government would reject any attempt by Texas officials to send migrants to Mexico. The Biden administration a pair of Texas nonprofit groups and the county government of El Paso filed the lawsuits seeking to stop the state law from taking effect.  We look forward to ending S.B. 4 once and for all Cody Wofsy deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union Immigrants Rights Project said Wednesday. The ACLU represents the two Texas nonprofits and El Paso County in the case. At least one other lawsuit has been filed on behalf of a Texas community organization La Uni n del Pueblo Entero LUPE and four unidentified immigrants who allege they are eligible to stay in the United States legally but could be targeted for deportation under the state law. Tania Chavez president and executive director of LUPE praised the decision saying Latinos in Texas who make up more than 40 percent of the state s population feared racial profiling and wrongful deportations of U.S. citizens or immigrants with a legal case to remain in this country. She said LUPE is urging people to remain aware of their rights especially as states such as Iowa are trying to replicate Texas s law and to apply for U.S. citizenship if they are eligible for it.  Today it s Texas but we don t know what will happen in other states tomorrow said Chavez. Don t leave things to fate.  William Branigin Ann E. Marimow and Arelis R.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/03/27/politics/texas-immigration-law-appeals-court/index.html,  A childs shoe hangs caught in razor wire atop the bank of the Rio Grande on January 9 2024 in Eagle Pass Texas. John MooreGetty Images CNN A controversial Texas law that allows state officials to arrest and detain people they suspect of entering the country illegally will remain blocked while legal challenges to it play out a federal appeals court said Tuesday.   In a 21 vote the court said the law known as SB 4 will continue to be blocked while the court considers the larger question of whether it violates the US Constitution. Immigration enforcement is generally a responsibility of the federal government.   The court s decision to not allow enforcement of the law caps off a messy few days in which SB 4 was caught in legal limbo after the Supreme Court allowed it to go into effect for a short period only for the appeals court panel to put it back on hold hours later.   In the majority opinion penned by Chief Judge Priscilla Richman the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals said that it s likely that the law runs afoul of the Constitution but said a lack of funding coupled with the lack of political will have left a gaping void in the area of immigration that Texas nobly and admirably some would say seeks to fill.   But it is unlikely that Texas can step into the shoes of the national sovereign under our Constitution and laws she wrote adding later The Texas removal provisions bestow powers upon itself that are likely reserved to the United States.   Richman was joined by Circuit Judge Irma Carrillo Ramirez who was appointed by President Joe Biden.   Circuit Judge Andrew Oldham who was appointed to the bench by former President Donald Trump wrote in a lengthy dissent that he would have let Texas enforce the law. He said that his colleagues readiness to invalidate the law is exceedingly troubling.   The State is forever helpless Texas can do nothing because Congress apparently did everything yet federal nonenforcement means Congress s everything is nothing Oldham wrote. And second while the dispute before us is entirely hypothetical the consequences of today s decision will be very real.   Signed into law by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott in December SB 4 makes entering Texas illegally a state crime and allows state judges to order immigrants to be deported. US District Judge David Alan Ezra had blocked the law in late February before it went into effect holding that the measure could open the door to each state passing its own version of immigration laws.   SB 4 directly challenges the federal government s longheld power to control immigration naturalization and removal Ezra wrote in the preliminary injunction. Applied to the field of immigration the federal government has both a dominant interest and a pervasive regulatory framework that preclude state regulation in the area.   Texas quickly appealed that decision. The appeals court will hear arguments on April 3 over whether to uphold the injunction. Doing so would be a devastating blow to the law.   Texas can appeal Tuesday s decision to the Supreme Court or ask the full 5th Circuit to review its request to enforce the law for now but both options are unlikely given the proximity to next week s hearing.   SB 4 s challengers include the Biden administration and two immigrant advocacy groups as well as El Paso County.   This story has been updated with additional details. 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2024/03/25/trump-melania-parents-chain-migration/, The records detail for the first time the full path that the former first lady s mother Amalija Knavs followed from Slovenia to the United States and how the Trump administration s policies would have made that far more difficult for others. Knavs died in January at age 78. Trump is the likely Republican candidate for president in the 2024 race against President Biden a Democrat. The Trump campaign declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Melania Trump used a legal pathway that her husband and his top advisers had repeatedly disparaged as chain migration the right of U.S. citizens to bring their parents to the United States. Federal law since 1965 has said U.S. citizens may apply to bring minor children and parents to join them in the United States without having to wait a long time for a visa. Citizens may sponsor siblings and adult children but they typically wait longer for visas. During his presidency Trump endorsed a bill called the Raise Act that would have limited priority sponsorship to the spouses and minor children of U.S. citizens taking parents off the fasttrack list.  The Democrats have been told and fully understand that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc. Trump tweeted on Dec. 29 2017. We must protect our Country at all cost!  Trump favored implementing a Canadianstyle pointbased merit system to prioritize skilled workers which also could have affected Knavs. On her 2009 immigrant visa application Knavs said she graduated from high school in 1964 and attended the College for Fashion Design in Slovenia until 1966 though it did not say whether she obtained a diploma. She married in 1967. By the time Knavs applied for an immigrant visa records show she was fluent in Slovenian but learning English. Her citizenship application says she retired in 1998. Michael Wildes Knavs s immigration lawyer declined to comment on her immigration file in a telephone interview Monday saying such records are typically confidential. The Washington Post requested the records from the Department of Homeland Security after Knavs s death when privacy protections are diminished. The 165page immigration file released Monday is heavily redacted in some parts but it confirms that Knavs was sponsored by an adult child for a green card and it lists the financial sponsor of the parent as Melania Trump.  Wildes a Democrat praised familybased immigration as part of a long tradition in the United States and called Trump s criticism of that system some of the silly politics of the day.  He said that the Knavses reveled in becoming citizens in this country and that Melania Trump wanted to ensure that her parents were taken care of and that they could travel freely to the United States to care for the Trumps son Barron. Wildes has said that Melania Trump arrived in the United States from Slovenia in 1996 for modeling work and obtained a green card around 2001 based on her extraordinary ability as a model. Records show that Knavs was a regular visitor to the United States after her daughter moved to this country and became a permanent resident. Melania Trump married Donald Trump in 2005 and had their son the following year. She said she also became a citizen in 2006. She applied to sponsor her mother for legal permanent residency known as a green card in 2008 the records show and signed an affidavit the following year pledging to support her mother financially. Knavs became a legal permanent resident one step before U.S. citizenship on March 16 2010. Greencard holders may apply for U.S. citizenship after five years. But records show Knavs waited longer. In May 2018 Knavs appeared in New York for an interview and citizenship test which involves questions in English and a test on U.S. civics. She correctly answered questions such as the name of the U.S. national anthem The StarSpangled Banner and the ocean on the west coast of the United States Pacific. Asked What is the rule of law? she gave no answer. Wildes has said the family received no special treatment. Records show Knavs filled out a citizenship application answering questions about whether she was associated with the Communist Party no and whether she would bear arms to defend the United States yes. She paid the 725 application fee and said she was living at the time in Trump Tower in New York. Knavs took the oath of citizenship with her husband Viktor whose immigration records are not public on Aug. 9 2018 in New York shortly after one of the worst debacles of Trump s presidency when his administration separated migrant parents from their children at the southern border without a plan to reunite them. Melania Trump garnered attention in June 2018 for visiting a children s shelter on the border wearing a green jacket with a message on the back reading I really don t care do u?  Wildes had earlier confirmed that Viktor and Amalija Knavs as well as their other daughter Ines who is Barron s godmother came to the United States legally with Melania Trump s help according to The Art of Her Deal a biography of Melania Trump by Post reporter Mary Jordan.

Credit Eddie GasparThe Texas Tribune Sign up for The Brief The Texas Tribune s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news. Texas lawmakers in 2023 approved Senate Bill 4 which allows Texas police to arrest people for illegally crossing the Mexico border. It was expected to go into effect in early March but legal challenges from the U.S. Justice Department and immigration advocacy organizations have repeatedly prevented the law from going into effect as litigation makes its way through federal courts. A federal appeals court on late Tuesday night once again blocked the state of Texas from enforcing the law hours after the U.S. Supreme Court had allowed the law to go into effect while the federal court case continued. This new law would make it a state crime to cross the TexasMexico border between ports of entry. If a police officer believes they have evidence that a person illegally crossed the Rio Grande that person could be charged with a Class B misdemeanor which carries a punishment of up to six months in jail. For subsequent offenses the person could be charged with a seconddegree felony and face up to 20 years in prison. If the migrant is convicted and has served their sentence a judge would be required to order police to transport them to a port of entry. A judge could drop the charges if a migrant agrees to return to Mexico and police could turn over migrant families to Border Patrol agents to avoid separating children from their parents instead of arresting them. A federal appeals court order has blocked the law ahead of a scheduled hearing in the lawsuit brought forward by immigrant rights advocates and the federal government. This came hours after the U.S. Supreme Court on March 19 issued an order allowing the state of Texas to enforce SB 4 as challenges to the law proceed in federal court. Just one day before the high court had extended a temporary court order blocking the law from going into effect. The bill allows police to question and arrest anyone they believe entered Texas through Mexico illegally and is currently without legal immigration status. However the author of the law has said it is meant to target people who recently crossed the border not undocumented immigrants who have been living in Texas for years. Texas statute of limitations blocks legal proceedings for misdemeanors two years after an offense has occurred. The statute of limitations is three years for many felonies. SB 4 prohibits police from arresting migrants in public or private schools churches and other places of worship health care facilities and facilities that provide forensic medical examinations to sexual assault survivors. The bill doesn t prohibit arrests on college or university campuses. Immigration advocacy organizations and the Department of Justice say the law encroaches on the federal government s sole authority over immigration and will lead to racial profiling by police. Texas officials have argued the state needs to step in because the federal government isn t doing enough to stop illegal immigration. Federal courts including the U.S. Supreme Court have previously ruled that immigration laws can only be enforced by the federal government. Texas has argued the law follows federal immigration laws and that the state has a right to defend itself under Article I Section 10 of the U.S. Constitution which prohibits states from engaging in war on their own unless actually invaded. A federal judge who blocked the law in February said he didn t see evidence of a war in Texas and that the federal government would suffer irreparable harm under the law because it could inspire other states to pass their own immigration laws. Anyone who enters the U.S. legally or illegally has up to one year to request asylum. The federal government is asking migrants to not show up at a port of entry and instead make an appointment to meet with an immigration officer. But available appointments fill quickly and many migrants opt to cross the border away from ports of entry and surrender to U.S. authorities. Under SB 4 if Texas police arrest a migrant before they surrender to Border Patrol immigrants who apply for asylum and are researched by federal agents for criminal histories could be subject to removal from the United States if charged with the new state crime. Consulates in the U.S. for countries like Mexico could provide their citizens with more information. Immigrant rights groups such as American Gateways are also trying to inform people who could be affected by the law. The American Civil Liberties Union of Texas which is one of the groups suing Texas over SB 4 has published information about peoples rights when it comes to the law and interactions with Texas police.

Procedures for determining dates. Consular officers are required to report to the Department of State documentarily qualified applicants for numerically limited visas USCIS reports applicants for adjustment of status. Allocations in the charts below were made to the extent possible in chronological order of reported priority dates for demand received by January 10th. If not all demand could be satisfied the category or foreign state in which demand was excessive was deemed oversubscribed. The final action date for an oversubscribed category is the priority date of the first applicant who could not be reached within the numerical limits. If it becomes necessary during the monthly allocation process to retrogress a final action date supplemental requests for numbers will be honored only if the priority date falls within the new final action date announced in this bulletin. If at any time an annual limit were reached it would be necessary to immediately make the preference category unavailable and no further requests for numbers would be honored. 2.

B. DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT DV CATEGORY FOR THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY Section 203c of the INA provides up to 55000 immigrant visas each fiscal year to permit additional immigration opportunities for persons from countries with low admissions during the previous five years. The NACARA stipulates that beginning with DV99 and for as long as necessary up to 5000 of the 55000 annually allocated diversity visas will be made available for use under the NACARA program. Visa numbers made available to NACARA applicants in FY 2023 will result in reduction of the DV2024 annual limit to approximately 54850. Section 5104 of the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for Fiscal Year 2024 amended the NACARA s provisions on the Diversity Visa program such that the number of visas made available under the NDAA will be deducted from the 55000 DVs annually allocated. These amendments will not impact the number of diversity visas available until FY 2025. DVs are divided among six geographic regions. No one country can receive more than seven percent of the available diversity visas in any one year. For February immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to qualified DV2024 applicants chargeable to all regionseligible countries as follows. When an allocation cutoff number is shown visas are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers BELOW the specified allocation cutoff number Except Iran 5450 Nepal 4500 Entitlement to immigrant status in the DV category lasts only through the end of the fiscal visa year for which the applicant is selected in the lottery. The year of entitlement for all applicants registered for the DV2024 program ends as of September 30 2024. DV visas may not be issued to DV2024 applicants after that date. Similarly spouses and children accompanying or following to join DV2024 principals are only entitled to derivative DV status until September 30 2024. DV visa availability through the very end of FY2024 cannot be taken for granted. Numbers could be exhausted prior to September 30. C. THE DIVERSITY DV IMMIGRANT CATEGORY RANK CUTOFFS WHICH WILL APPLY IN MARCH For March immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to qualified DV2024 applicants chargeable to all regionseligible countries as follows. When an allocation cutoff number is shown visas are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers BELOW the specified allocation cutoff number D. SCHEDULED EXPIRATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT FOURTH PREFERENCE RELIGIOUS WORKERS SR CATEGORY Pursuant to H.R. 6363 signed on November 16 2023 the nonminister special immigrant program expires on February 2 2024. No SR visas may be issued overseas or final action taken on adjustment of status cases after midnight February 1 2024. Visas issued prior to that date will be valid only until February 1 2024 and all individuals seeking admission in the nonminister special immigrant category must be admitted repeat admitted into the United States no later than midnight February 1 2024.  The SR category is available and subject to the same final action dates as the other Employment Fourth Preference categories per applicable foreign state of chargeability for February. In the event there is no legislative action extending the category beyond February 2 2024 the category will immediately become Unavailable as of February 2 2024. In the event there is legislative action extending the category beyond February 2 the published dates will continue to be in effect for the remainder of February. E. U.S. GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEE SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISAS SIVs The National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for Fiscal Year 2024 signed into law on December 22 2023 may affect certain current and former employees of the U.S. Government abroad applying for SIVs or adjustment of status as described in section 101a27D of the INA. This does not affect certain Iraqis and Afghans applying for SQ and SI SIVs. Applicants should contact the consular section at which they filed their Form DS 1884 for further information on the impact of that law on their case. F.

STATUTORY NUMBERS FOR PREFERENCE IMMIGRANT VISAS This bulletin summarizes the availability of immigrant numbers during March for Final Action Dates and Dates for Filing Applications indicating when immigrant visa applicants should be notified to assemble and submit required documentation to the National Visa Center. Unless otherwise indicated on the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS website at www.uscis.govvisabulletininfo individuals seeking to file applications for adjustment of status with USCIS must use the Final Action Dates charts below for determining when they can file such applications. When USCIS determines that there are more immigrant visas available for the fiscal year than there are known applicants for such visas USCIS will state on its website that applicants may instead use the Dates for Filing Visa Applications charts in this Bulletin.  1. Procedures for determining dates. Consular officers are required to report to the Department of State documentarily qualified applicants for numerically limited visas USCIS reports applicants for adjustment of status. Allocations in the charts below were made to the extent possible in chronological order of reported priority dates for demand received by February 6th. If not all demand could be satisfied the category or foreign state in which demand was excessive was deemed oversubscribed. The final action date for an oversubscribed category is the priority date of the first applicant who could not be reached within the numerical limits. If it becomes necessary during the monthly allocation process to retrogress a final action date supplemental requests for numbers will be honored only if the priority date falls within the new final action date announced in this bulletin. If at any time an annual limit were reached it would be necessary to immediately make the preference category unavailable and no further requests for numbers would be honored. 2. The fiscal year 2024 limit for familysponsored preference immigrants determined in accordance with Section 201 of the Immigration and Nationality Act INA is 226000. The worldwide level for annual employmentbased preference immigrants is at least 140000. Section 202 prescribes that the percountry limit for preference immigrants is set at 7 of the total annual familysponsored and employmentbased preference limits i.e. 25620. The dependent area limit is set at 2 or 7320. 3. INA Section 203e provides that familysponsored and employmentbased preference visas be issued to eligible immigrants in the order in which a petition in behalf of each has been filed.

B. DIVERSITY IMMIGRANT DV CATEGORY FOR THE MONTH OF MARCH Section 203c of the INA provides up to 55000 immigrant visas each fiscal year to permit additional immigration opportunities for persons from countries with low admissions during the previous five years. The NACARA stipulates that beginning with DV99 and for as long as necessary up to 5000 of the 55000 annually allocated diversity visas will be made available for use under the NACARA program. Visa numbers made available to NACARA applicants in FY 2023 will result in reduction of the DV2024 annual limit to approximately 54850. Section 5104 of the National Defense Authorization Act NDAA for Fiscal Year 2024 amended the NACARA s provisions on the Diversity Visa program such that the number of visas made available under the NDAA will be deducted from the 55000 DVs annually allocated. These amendments will not impact the number of diversity visas available until FY 2025. DVs are divided among six geographic regions. No one country can receive more than seven percent of the available diversity visas in any one year. For March immigrant numbers in the DV category are available to qualified DV2024 applicants chargeable to all regionseligible countries as follows. When an allocation cutoff number is shown visas are available only for applicants with DV regional lottery rank numbers BELOW the specified allocation cutoff number Except Iran 6750 Nepal 5000 Entitlement to immigrant status in the DV category lasts only through the end of the fiscal visa year for which the applicant is selected in the lottery. The year of entitlement for all applicants registered for the DV2024 program ends as of September 30 2024. DV visas may not be issued to DV2024 applicants after that date. Similarly spouses and children accompanying or following to join DV2024 principals are only entitled to derivative DV status until September 30 2024. DV visa availability through the very end of FY2024 cannot be taken for granted. Numbers could be exhausted prior to September 30. C.
