https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/23/biden-administration-believes-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-will-survive.html, After the Supreme Court blocked President Joe Biden s first plan to forgive student debt last summer his administration set out to create a relief package that would survive legal attacks. Here s why the U.S. Department of Education thinks the new plan will endure. Biden s 2020 campaign promise to erase student debt was thwarted at the Supreme Court in June. The majorityconservative court ruled that Biden didn t have the authority to erase 400 billion in student debt without prior authorization from Congress. Biden had tried to forgive the debt of nearly all 40 million federal student loan borrowers with many people getting up to 20000 in cancellation. This time the Biden administration has narrowed its aid by targeting specific groups of borrowers including those who ve been in repayment for decades or attended schools of lowfinancial value. It hopes this will help the plan survive in front of a court that is skeptical of broad loan cancellation experts say. More than 25 million borrowers still stand to benefit from the program. As a result for critics of broad student loan forgiveness Biden s new plan looks a great deal like his first. After the president touted his revised relief program on April 8 Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey a Republican wrote on X that Biden is trying to unabashedly eclipse the Constitution.  In addition to the fact that this effort is a more targeted aid program the U.S. Department of Education is also using a different law the Higher Education Act as its legal justification. Biden s first forgiveness plan was based on the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act or HEROES Act of 2003. The HEROES Act was passed in the aftermath of the 911 terrorist attacks and grants the president broad power to revise student loan programs during national emergencies. The Biden administration initially tried to use this law because at the time the country was under a national emergency status from the Covid19 pandemic. However the conservative justices didn t buy that argument.  Can the Secretary use his powers to abolish 430 billion in student loans completely canceling loan balances for 20 million borrowers as a pandemic winds down to its end? Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion for Biden v. Nebraska. We can t believe the answer would be yes.  The HEA which the Biden administration is now using was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965 and allows the education secretary some authority to waive or release borrowers education debt. When Sen. Elizabeth Warren DMass. was running for president in 2020 she pointed to the HEA as a law that would allow her to deliver sweeping loan relief.  This authority provides a safety valve for federal student loan programs letting the Department of Education use its discretion to wipe away loans even when they do not meet the eligibility criteria for more specific cancellation programs Warren wrote in her student loan forgiveness proposal back then. Biden initially attempted to forgive student debt through executive action which the Supreme Court ruled was unconstitutional. The president has now turned to negotiated rulemaking.

Congress already authorized the U.S. Department of Education to issue regulations on specific aspects of the law said higher education expert Mark Kantrowitz.  Also historically the courts have given some deference to federal agencies with regard to regulatory authority Kantrowitz said. That doesn t mean the court won t block new regulations just that they are less likely to do so.

Sections Sections Share Share Search Sections Sections Share Share Subscribe to the Hutchins Roundup and NewsletterSign Up Commentary Economic Studies The Hutchins Center on Fiscal and Monetary Policy  Don t tell me what you value. Show me your budget and I ll tell you what you value.  Even modest student loan forgiveness proposals are staggeringly expensive and use federal spending that could advance other goals. The sums involved in loanforgiveness proposals under discussion would exceed cumulative spending on many of the nation s major antipoverty programs over the last several decades. There are better ways to spend that money that would better achieve progressive goals. Increasing spending on more targeted policies would benefit families that are poorer more disadvantaged and more likely to be Black and Hispanic compared to those who stand to benefit from broad student loan forgiveness. Indeed shoring up spending on other safety net programs would be a far more effective way to help lowincome people and people of color. Student loan relief could be designed to aid those in greater need advance economic opportunity and reduce social inequities but only if it is targeted to borrowers based on family income and postcollege earnings. Those who borrowed to get college degrees that are paying off in good jobs with high incomes do not need and should not benefit from loanforgiveness initiatives that are sold as a way to help truly struggling borrowers. In terms of its scale in budget and cost to taxpayers widespread student loan forgiveness would rank among the largest transfer programs in American history. Based on data from the Department of Education forgiving all federal loans as Senator Bernie Sanders proposed would cost on the order of 1.6 trillion.1 Forgiving student debt up to 50000 per borrower as Senators Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer have proposed would cost about 1 trillion. Limiting loan forgiveness to 10000 as President Biden has proposed would cost about 373 billion. Under each of these proposals all 43 million borrowers would stand to benefit to differing degrees. To put those numbers in perspective the chart below compares the cost of these three onetime student loan forgiveness proposals against cumulative spending on several of the country s largest transfer programs over the last twenty years from 2000 to 2019 adjusted for inflation.  Forgiving all student debt would be a transfer larger than the amounts the nation has spent over the past 20 years on unemployment insurance larger than the amount it has spent on the Earned Income Tax Credit and larger than the amount it has spent on food stamps. In 2020 about 43 million Americans relied on food stamps to feed their families. To be eligible a household of three typically must earn less than 28200 a year. The EITC the nation s largest antipoverty program benefitted about 26 million working families in 2018. That year the credit lifted almost 11 million Americans out of poverty including about 6 million children and reduced poverty for another 18 million individuals. Forgiving up to 50000 of student debt is similar in cost to the cumulative amount spent on Supplemental Security Income SSI and all housing assistance programs since 2000. Supplemental Security Income provides cash assistance to 8 million people who are disabled or elderly and have little income and few assets. Recipients must have less than 2000 in assets. About half have zero other income. The cost of forgiving 50000 of student debt per borrower is almost twice as large as the federal government has spent on all Pell Grant recipients over the last two decades. In contrast to federal loans which have no income eligibility limits and are available to undergraduates graduate students and parents Pell Grants are awarded only to low and middleincome undergraduate students with demonstrated financial need. About seven million students each year benefit many of whom are poor and the majority of whom are nonwhite. Even 10000 in debt forgiveness would involve a transfer that is about as large as the country has spent on welfare TANF since 2000 and exceeds the amount spent since then on feeding hungry school children in highpoverty schools through the school breakfast and lunch program. Likewise it dwarfs spending on programs that help feed lowincome pregnant women and infants or provide energy assistance to those who otherwise struggle to heat their homes in winter. Beyond the sums that debt forgiveness would represent the beneficiaries of student loan forgiveness would be higher income better educated and whiter than beneficiaries of other transfer programs. The following table describes the economic and demographic characteristics of beneficiaries of selected income support programs as well as wouldbe beneficiaries of student debt forgiveness. Food stamps for instance serve households whose median income is about 19000 a year half are in poverty and provide 2300 annually for the average household. Medicaid households earn about 33000 about 34 percent are below the poverty line. Families that claim the Earned Income Tax Credit the largest cash income support for working families earn about 36500 their average annual benefit is about 2200.  In contrast the median income of households with student loans is 76400 and 7 percent are below the poverty line. Among those making payment on their loans and who would have an immediate cash flow benefit from forgiveness the median income is 86500 and 4 percent are in poverty. If debt forgiveness were capped at 50000 the average benefit to these households would be roughly 26000 about the same as we provide a family living on food stamps over the course of 11 years. In terms of demographics and educational attainment households with student debt largely mirror the characteristics of households in the population at large except they are better educated. Student loan borrowers are more likely to be white and highly educated. Indeed among those making payments on student loans the fraction of households that are white is the same as in the population at large but they are about 70 percent more likely to have a BA and twice as likely to have a graduate degree. In contrast households that benefit from federal programs like SNAP the EITC SSI or Medicaid are more likely to be Black or Hispanic and have much lower levels of educational attainment few have gone to college and almost none have a graduate degree. For reference among all households the Census reports that 66 percent identify as white 13 percent Black or African American and 14 percent as Hispanic. About 42 percent have a BA and 18 percent a graduate degree. In short beneficiaries of acrosstheboard student loan forgiveness would be higher income better educated and more likely to be white than beneficiaries of just about all other programs designed to reduce hardship and promote opportunity and targeted to those who need help. Prioritizing spending on targeted programs would therefore be a more effective way to achieve progressive goals. Biden s proposal to make the child tax credit fully refundable for example would exclusively benefit children living in poverty. Twenty six percent of beneficiaries of that policy would be Black and 29 percent Hispanic. That is a progressive change that would lift the incomes of millions of very poor children. It would also benefit many student loan borrowers as well as many who don t have student loans. Student loan relief could be targeted to those who need help most. Use borrower s financial aid application Every student with a federal student loan has already filled out an application for financial aid and that application remains on record at the Department of Education. That information could be used to target aid based on students economic circumstances at the time of application. For example the Pell Grant is available only to undergraduate students from low and middleincome families. As a result relative to other postsecondary students Pell Grant recipients are from poorer families and are more likely to be Black and Hispanic students. Biden has proposed to double the Pell Grant prospectively. If future students got additional grant money you could argue that prior students should have had that opportunity too and we could reduce borrowers undergraduate loan balances by the amount they should have gotten in Pell plus interest. That would be more progressive and concentrate the benefit of debt forgiveness on students from disadvantaged backgrounds. Incomedriven repayment Incomedriven repayment plans like Pay As You Earn or PAYE remain an excellent way to target debt relief and forgiveness to students whose postenrollment incomes are too low to be able to make student debt payments. The Biden Administration has new tools enacted in the FUTURE Act that if implemented would make it easier for students to sign up and remain in incomedriven plans. Getting incomedriven plans to work effectively is necessary because student lending isn t going away. Even the most ambitious free college proposals would only modestly reduce the volume of new student debt because they only cover tuition and fees at public institutions. Graduate students students at private colleges and students who borrow to cover living expenses would still be reliant on loans to finance their education. Those costs represent the majority of loan dollars students borrow each year. Incomedriven repayment will be necessary to help these future borrowers manage their loans. Between targeted debt relief to students from lowincome families improvements in incomedriven plans and implementing forgiveness plans like public service loan forgiveness already on the books Congress and the Biden Administration can reduce hardships imposed by federal lending and advance economic opportunity without acrosstheboard loan forgiveness. Congress and the Administration can t do it all. We need to weigh studentloan forgiveness against other spending priorities and be clear about what we value most. 1 Administrative data from the Department of Education shows that borrowers owe a total of 1.57 trillion the sum of balances under 50000 is 1.05 trillion and the sum of balances under 10000 is 377 billion. CBO estimates the subsidy rate on student loans the amount that would not be repaid in present value is 3 on newlyoriginated loans in 2021. As a result I assume the cost is 97 of the value reported by the Department of Education. For purposes of understanding the magnitude of the transfer the face value is also relevant because it reflects the total amount of aid provided to students. These estimates are larger than estimates based on data from the Survey of Consumer Finances SCF because about a third of student debt is not reported in that survey.

https://www.procon.org/headlines/should-student-loan-debt-be-easier-to-discharge-in-bankruptcy-top-3-pros-cons/, Student loan debt is frequently in the news as politicians debate solutions to the rising costs of college that lead to sometimes crippling amounts of debt. For those with outstanding student loans such debt can be discharged in two ways forgiveness and bankruptcy. Americans owed a collective 1.71 trillion in student loan debt as of Dec. 2020 according to the Federal Reserve. By comparison in Dec. 2010 Americans owed about 845 billion in student loan debt which means student loan debt has increased by about 102 over the last ten years. 1 2  According to the U.S. Department of Education 42.9 million Americans held outstanding student loan debt at the end of 2020 or about 17 of the U.S. adult population. 75 of students with schoolloan debt went to 2 or 4year colleges and the remaining 25 also borrowed for graduate school. About 6 of people with school loan debt owe more than 100000 this group accounts for about a third of all outstanding student loan debt and usually encompasses both college as well as graduate school expenses. Approximately 40 leave college with between 20000 and 100000 in outstanding student loans. About 25 leave college with less than 20000 in debt and 30 leave with no student loan debt. 3 4  The New York Federal Reserve reported that about 11 of student loan debt payments were either late or in default 270 or more days late at the beginning of 2020. By all indications this debt and the late payments and defaults as well will continue to rise as college costs outpace average incomes. 5 6 7  By Nov. 2021 the Education Data Initiative estimated 43.2 million student borrowers owed an average of 39351 each. 40  Some have proposed that the U.S. federal government forgive some or all existing student loan debt in order to relieve the financial pressure on individuals and the country. Student debt forgiveness proposals range from a discharge of 10000 per borrower which would forgive the entire debt bills held by about 15 million borrowers to 50000 per borrower which would forgive the entire debt bills held by about 36 million borrowers to plans that would forgive all outstanding student loan debt. Each plan would include forgiveness for those with late or indefault accounts as well as partial debt forgiveness for many more borrowers. 8  The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania estimated that depending on details over ten years college debt cancellation will cost between 300 billion for a onetime cancellation of 10000 for borrowers earning under 125000 per year and 980 billion for a onetime cancellation of 50000 per borrower. 43 Others have proposed making student loan debt easier to discharge through bankruptcy. Credit card debt medical bills auto loans and even gambling debt can be canceled by declaring bankruptcy but due to a 1976 federal law discharging student loan debt is much more difficult. Private student loans have also been protected from discharge in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act of 2005. According to the U.S. Department of Education people who declare Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy can have student loan debt canceled but only if a court finds there is evidence of undue hardship. Getting student loans discharged is so difficult and rare however that many lawyers advise clients not to try less than 0.5 of students clear their debts through bankruptcy. 9 10 11 12 13  In Mar. 2020 at the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic President Trump paused federal student loan payments interest accrual and debt collection. Congress voted to keep the pause through Sep. 30 2021 and Trump extended it again through January 2021. President Biden maintained the pause with several renewals after taking office. His latest freeze announced on Apr. 6 2022 will expire on Aug. 31 2022. While some disagree with the continuation of payment interest and collection pauses others question why federal student loan debt can t be canceled if the federal government can do without payments for almost three years. 41  On Aug. 24 2022 President Biden announced a short loan freeze through Dec. 31 2022 as well as a cancellation of up to 20000 of federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients and up to 10000 for other qualifying borrowers. The White House stated about 43 million borrowers would qualify the cancellation with 20 million borrowers qualifying to have their debt completely canceled. The debt cancellation program has been mired in lawsuits since its announcement resulting in a court stay of the program. On Dec. 1 2022 the U.S. Supreme Court indicated it would hear the case in Feb. 2023 leaving the stay in place. On June 30 2023 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the student loan program in a 63 vote under the premise that federal law does not permit the U.S. Department of Education to cancel such student loans. 42 48 49 50 The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania estimated that the debt cancellation portion of Biden s Aug. 2022 plan will cost up to 519 billion with other components such as incomebased repayment plans adding additional costs. The Congressional Budget Office CBO estimated the plan will cost 400 billion over 30 years. 44 47 Student loan debt slows new business growth and quashes consumer spending. A Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia study found a significant and economically meaningful negative correlation between student loan debt and the falling rate of new small businesses. Such debt can make getting a business or any other loan difficult so people with student loan debt are less likely to be able to open businesses. And the effects snowball from there fewer small businesses means fewer jobs and less economic output and consumer spending which in turn means lower national income and slow economic growth for the country. 14 15 15  As William Foster Vice President Senior Credit Officer explained U.S. real GDP could be boosted on average by 86 billion to 108 billion per year which is quite a bit That s if you had total loan forgiveness. Though Foster stated total forgiveness isn t necessary to see a positive impact. 16  President Joe Biden when announcing his loan cancellation program stated I ran for office to grow the economy from the bottom up and the middle out because when we do that everyone does better everybody does well. The wealthy do very well the poor have a way up and the middle class can have breathing room. And that s going to help America win the economic competition of the 21st century . That s what today s announcement is about. It s about opportunity. It s about giving people a fair shot. It s about the one word America can be defined by possibilities. It s all about providing possibilities. 46  When everyone can t participate in the economy the whole economy suffers. Black college students borrow more than their white counterparts due to family income generational wealth parental education and the types of colleges attended. 17  According to Judith ScottClayton Senior Research Scholar with the Community College Research Center at Columbia University interest rates and graduate school loans leave black graduates with twice as much debt as white graduates almost 53000 four years after graduation. ScottClayton also noted black graduates default on student loans at a rate of 21 while white graduates default at 4. The disparity she explains is the result of most black students who default having attended predatory forprofit colleges that have overall higher default rates for all students. 17  Ashley Harrington Federal Advocacy Director and Senior Counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending explained the catch22 in which students of color often find themselves The student debt crisis is absolutely a racial justice issue. For brown and Black folks they often need to get more education to get the same salaries and positions that white folks can get with less education and that means how do they do that? They have to take on more debt The debt is then preventing wealth building This is something that is impacting not just individuals it s impacting their families their communities. 18  An Aug. 2020 Roosevelt Institute study concluded While individual white borrowers at the median stand to gain the most in absolute dollars from student debt cancellation the relative gains for Black borrowers are much larger and the greater proportion of Black borrowers means that Black wealth overall would experience more growth as a result. Given the many advantages wealth confers in the contemporary U.S. context the substantial increase in Black net worth is a very significant positive contribution of student debt cancellation one with potentially transformative positive impacts for Black families overall. The help provided by student loan debt forgiveness exceeds simple dollar amounts.19  For women with bachelor s degrees each increase in 1000 of student loan debt decreased the odds of marriage by 2 per month in the four years after graduation. 14  Student loan debt prevented about 400000 people from buying homes between 2005 and 2014 which accounted for 25 of the decrease in homeownership. Every 1000 increase in student loan debt lowered the home ownership rate by 1.5 for those who attended fouryear colleges. Further student loan debtors save half as much for retirement by age 30 as those without debt. 14 20 14  An Aug. 2020 Roosevelt Institute study explained The positive effects of an evidencebased student debt cancellation policy for individuals and households extend far beyond the immediate need of removing burdensome debt. The ramifications for financial and personal wellbeing credit job stability and satisfaction homeownership earlier in the life course capacity to build wealth for emergencies human capital investments family stability and accumulating wealth can multiply throughout a person s life. Choosing to go to college to compete in the job market shouldn t prevent people from living the American dream. 19  The U.S. Supreme Court said in 1915 that the benefits of bankruptcy allow debtors to start afresh free from the obligations and responsibilities. Famous business leaders from Henry Ford to President Donald Trump have used bankruptcy for a fresh start. 21 22  Car loans credit card charges medical bills and even gambling debts can be discharged in bankruptcy not allowing educational debt to be discharged is unfair. Mark Huelsman Senior Policy Analyst at Demos wrote In a world where most students must borrow for a credential borrowers should receive the same failsafe protections on these loans as they do on any other consumer loan. 13 23  Students who didn t understand the consequences of taking out big loans at age 18 or who were misled about future job prospects can be saddled with sixfigure debt for decades. 24 25  A 2020 survey found 46 of Americans believe student loan forgiveness is unfair to those who have paid off their loans and 39 believe it unfair to those without loans. 26  Matthew Noyes columnist at Lone Conservative who noted the sacrifices he had to make to pay off his 27000 in student loans explained Taking out a loan is a choice and personal responsibility shouldn t be supplanted by taxpayer bailouts. Canceling student loans means penalizing people like me for honoring my word and repaying the debt I chose to accept. 27  Noyes states that the forgiveness debate is steeped in the idea that people are entitled to a college education and other peoples hard work. It codifies in policy the idea that adults are not responsible for their own actions i.e. taking on debt. In a free society I am not entitled to a college education and neither is anyone else. 27  Further less than 20 of American adults have student loan debt. Is it fair to offer relief to people who overstretched their financial capabilities to go to college and not those without student loans debt but who may still struggle financially? 28  Constantine Yannelis Professor of Finance at the University of Chicago found Any policy that is a universal loan forgiveness policy or a capped forgiveness policy say forgiving debt up to 50000 is going to give most of the dollars in forgiveness to upperincome individuals Basically most of the benefits will end up accruing to upperincome individuals. 29  As journalist Emma Ayers added Students from families earning more than 114000 a year borrow at the same rate as the lowestincome students and they take out loans nearly twice as large. Students with advanced degrees lawyers doctors and others account for 40 of all student debt according to estimates by American Progress. And the top 25 of incomeearning households hold almost half of student loan debt Student forgiveness would largely be a hand up to the better off. 30  Moreover as Adam Looney Nonresident Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institute pointed out student loan forgiveness only benefits people who went to college More than 90 percent of children from the highestincome families have attended college by age 22 versus 35 percent from the lowestincome families. Workers with bachelor s degrees earn about 500000 more over the course of their careers than individuals with high school diplomas That s why about 34 percent of all student debt is owed by borrowers in the top quartile of the income distribution and only 12 percent owed by the bottom 25 percent. Indeed the majority of all student debt is owed by borrowers with graduate degrees. 31  People who borrowed for masters degrees and PhDs hold 56 of student loan debt according to Brookings Institute estimates. Holding a masters or doctorate degree is also correlated to higher incomes. People with master s degrees earn about 2.7 million over a lifetime more than twice what those with high school diplomas earn 1.3 million. PhD holders earn 3.3 million more over a lifetime. 32 33  Inez Stepman Senior Policy Analyst at Independent Women s Forum for Prager University argued the people who staff government bureaucracies corporate HR departments and school administrations the people chiefly responsible for the woke minirevolutions upending institution after institution will benefit. For this managerial class student loan forgiveness would be great but the 300 billion to 1.9 trillion tax burden would be shouldered largely by the working class that didn t attend college. 45  The U.S. already has several student loan forgiveness programs and yet we re still in a student loan debt crisis. People who work in public service jobs can have their loans forgiven after 120 loan payments. Some teachers can have up to 17500 forgiven after five years of teaching. Nurses can have up to 60 of nursing education loans forgiven followed by another 25. 8  Incomedriven repayment IDR plans are available that allow loans to be forgiven after 2025 years of incomebased payments. Military members can have up to 100 of their loans forgiven. Medical doctors and lawyers have multiple options for forgiveness. AmeriCorps service members can have 100 of their loans forgiven. 8  Betsy Mayotte President and Founder of the Institute of Student Loan Advisors noted To me the free or debtfree college proposals hold more weight than loan forgiveness as they address the illness itself rather than just the symptoms. Don t get me wrong if we could find a way to do both we should but reducing the debt consumers have to take out in the first place would be the thing that would have the longerlasting benefit to the economy. 15  The U.S. needs a solution to outsized college costs that cause students to take out loans in the first place rather than a temporary solution that does nothing to prevent the next generation from accruing similar debt. Making it easier to discharge loans would give people an incentive to take out loans with no intention of paying them back or to borrow more than they need. Which in turn could cause them to seek bankruptcy without fully realizing the negative longterm consequences on their credit scores and other aspects of their lives. 34 35 36  New college graduates rarely have significant assets to surrender in bankruptcy so they have less incentive to avoid bankruptcy. 37  Student debt elimination through bankruptcy would encourage increased borrowing and more borrowing leads to higher tuition. Abigail Hall Blanco Assistant Professor of Economics at the University of Tampa said loan forgiveness would be one giant subsidy creating perverse incentives for both schools and students. If schools knew the government would forgive the cost of their students education they d face no incentive to cut costs to keep tuition down. 38 39  Discussion Questions 1.

https://www.crfb.org/blogs/everything-you-need-know-about-student-debt-cancellation, Below are a few frequently asked questions about student debt cancellation and proposals around it. The Biden Administration announced a plan to cancel up to 10000 of debt for federal student loan holders and up to 20000 of debt for all federal student loan borrowers who have received a Pell Grant. Only households earning less than 250000 per year or 125000 for an individual will be eligible. We estimate this will cancel approximately 525 billion in student debt. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the announced debt cancellation plan will cost between 330 billion and 390 billion with a central estimate of 360 billion. It will cancel about 525 billion of student debt. The cost of this cancellation is lower than the amount of debt itself because some of that debt was already projected to be forgiven through other forgiveness programs or not paid back in full. The three major proposals for student debt cancellation that were discussed before the Biden Administrations announcement were cancelling all student debt cancelling up to 50000 worth of student debt for each borrower or cancelling 10000 worth of debt per borrower. The 50000 proposal is favored by some in Congress whereas President Biden proposed cancelling 10000 per borrower during his campaign.  One additional wrinkle is what types of student debt should be cancelled. At least some versions include both student loans issued by the federal government and loans issued privately by banks. About 92 percent of all outstanding loans are federal student loans. President Bidens announced cancellation plan is only for federal student loans. The estimated costs of the three major federal student debt cancellation proposals are The estimated costs of cancelling 10000 and 50000 of debt are lower than the total amount of debt being cancelled. That s because the federal government already expects some of that debt to be forgiven and so it doesn t count it as a cost to cancel the debt. However the portfolio as a whole is expected to roughly break even with some people paying a high enough interest rate to pay for the people who see their debt cancelled. As a result cancelling all student debt would cost the same as the total amount of debt outstanding.  Yes it really costs money. When the federal government lends out federal student loans it calculates the lifetime cost of the loan in the year it is issued. On average under federal accounting standards the government expects to make about three cents for every dollar it lends. That s because it expects most loans to be paid back with interest.1 If the loan is not repaid at all it would cost money because the government was expecting the loans funds back. The ultimate cost of debt cancellation to the federal government is equal to the amount of debt that is cancelled plus any expected interest payments to the government minus the cost of borrowing for the government and minus any debt that would have been cancelled or not paid back anyway. To learn more about why cancellation costs money check out this post. President Bidens announced cancellation plan will wipe out about 525 billion of debt. Roughly 20 million borrowers are eligible to have their entire debt wiped out while another roughly 21 million borrowers are eligible to have part of their debt erased.  Cancelling all federal student loan debt would wipe out all 1.6 trillion of student debt for the 43 million borrowers that have it.  Cancelling 50000 of debt per borrower would wipe out 1 trillion worth of debt. It would wipe all of the federal student loan debt for 36 million borrowers and reduce it for an additional 7 million borrowers.  Cancelling 10000 of debt per borrower would wipe out 380 billion worth of debt. It would eliminate all federal student loan debt for 15 million borrowers and reduce it for an additional 28 million borrowers.  The student debt cancellation proposals that have previously been analyzed are regressive because they provide a disproportionate benefit to higher income and wealthier households. The main reason for this is that people who go to college and beyond are much more likely to earn high incomes and have high lifetime wealth compared to people who don t go to college. However President Bidens announced cancellation policy has not previously been studied and we dont currently know how regressive it is though it is likely to be less regressive than previous proposals due to the higher cancellation for Pell Grant recipients. When measured by income the previously debated debt cancellation proposals gave a much higher proportion of its benefit to top earners. For example a report from the University of Chicago showed that the top 10 percent of earners receive more from cancellation than the entire bottom 30 percent of earners. This is the reverse of progressive policy where the majority of the benefit should go to the lowest earners. Student debt cancellation proposals are also regressive by wealth when properly measured. The most accessible report on this question comes from Brookings which shows that when properly accounting for lifetime earnings student debt cancellation is highly regressive. Some advocates have claimed the opposite by including student debt without the potential payoff of debt which makes doctors coming out of school look extremely poor compared to those who earned an Associates degree. Once one accounts for the lifetime earnings potential of the doctor what the author Adam Looney calls human capital student debt cancellation is shown to be highly regressive. Its not clear at this time how the announced Biden cancellation policy affects the racial wealth gaps. For previously debated cancellation proposals once one accounts for the lifetime wealth one will likely achieve student loan cancellation does not significantly decrease the racial wealth gap. In fact a recent Brookings paper on the topic shows that the top 20 percent of white nonHispanic households by lifetime wealth hold 25 percent of all student debt and hold more student debt than all BlackAfrican American households combined. This shows that debt cancellation disproportionately benefits white wealthier households because those are the people most likely to owe and be paying down their debt. Yes debt cancellation will likely increase inflation. By reducing peoples monthly payments and increasing their net wealth debt cancellation will lead borrowers to spend more in an economy that is already demandsaturated and supplyconstrained. We previously estimated that cancelling the entire portfolio would increase Personal Consumption Expenditure PCE inflation somewhere between 10 to 50 basis points likely closer to 50. We are currently in the process of estimating the inflationary effect of the announced Biden cancellation plan. Cancelling student debt is a very ineffective way to stimulate the economy. Even when the economy was operating below potential we found that student debt cancellation had a low economic multiplier which means that it has a low bang for its buck given the cost. In an economy operating below potential we estimated full cancellation would have a multiplier between 0.08x and 0.23x. That means for every dollar spent on cancellation it would put eight to 23 cents back into the economy which is a very low amount compared to other stimulus policies. For partial debt cancellation we estimated a multiplier of between 0.02x and 0.27x when the economy is operating below potential. For 50000 in cancellation our central estimate was 0.10x and for 10000 in cancellation our central estimate was 0.13x. However that is assuming the economy is operating below potential. Right now the economy is operating above potential with demand far outstripping supply and increasing inflation. Any additional dollar in stimulus will have less effect because much of it will feed through to inflation. That means cancelling student debt would have an even lower stimulative effect than our initial estimates. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the total amount of outstanding federal loan debt will return to its current level in 2028 if all eligible borrowers loans are cancelled.  It s unclear. Both the Justice Department and the Department of Education issued memos arguing that the Biden Administration has legal authority to cancel student debt. The Department of Education under the Trump Administration issued a legal memo arguing that it was not legal. The best breakdown of legal arguments can be found in this Harvard Law School brief. Another article in the Virginia Law Review questions whether anyone would have standing that is whether anyone would have the ability to successfully sue the government in the event of cancellation. The Wall Street Journal reported that the top lawyer for President Obama s Department of Education recently produced a confidential legal memo that concluded it would be legally risky to broadly cancel debt via executive action. No. The payment pause that has been in effect since the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic is even more regressive than cancelling student debt. The people with the highest levels of debt and the highest monthly loan payments tend to be those with the highest earning potential. When the federal government forgives interest every month it disproportionately benefits those doing well in the economy. The payment pause since the start of the pandemic will have cost 155 billion by the end of this year when it is set to expire. Through December 2022 a recently graduated medical doctor will have had 68000 of debt effectively cancelled due to the repayment pause compared to 2500 for someone who left college without a degree. A very small percentage of borrowers account for a massive portion of the amount of federal student debt outstanding. Those with over 100000 of debt outstanding the majority of whom have master s and professional degrees account for 7 percent of borrowers but 40 percent of the amount of federal student loan debt owed.

In that case cancelling student loans would cost less though it would still be extremely expensive. However since that s not currently how Congress accounts for the cost it s not the way we measure the cost to cancel student loans.

Get student loan relief sooner by enrolling in the new incomedriven repayment plan SAVE. On April 8 2024 President Joe Biden shared new details of a plan B of the broad student debt cancellation plan struck down by the Supreme Court in June 2023. The new plan primarily benefits borrowers by reducing or eliminating the interest that can make student loan balances balloon. It would fully eliminate accrued interest for 23 million borrowers who owe more than they originally borrowed two million additional borrowers would see their interest balances reduced. The proposal would also forgive debt for borrowers facing financial hardships like expensive childcare or healthcare. In tandem with existing forgiveness programs the plan would help erase four million borrowers total debt the White House said.  It s for the good of our economy Biden said at a press conference held in Madison Wisconsin on April 8. By freeing millions of Americans from student debt it means they can finally get on with their lives instead of their lives being put on hold.  The president said the new relief plan could be in place by this fall though an exact timeline remains unclear. The plan is not yet finalized and legal challenges could delay or derail its implementation.  Even without this plan B the White House has already erased 153 billion in debt for 4.3 million borrowers who qualify for existing student loan forgiveness programs as of April 12.  That forgiveness tally includes 62.8 billion for 876000 Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF borrowers. 49.2 billion for 996000 longtime borrowers through the IDR account adjustment. 4.8 billion for 360000 borrowers enrolled in the SAVE plan. 22.5 billion for 1.3 million borrowers eligible for borrower defense or closed school discharges. 14.1 billion for 548000 borrowers with a total and permanent disability.  MORE How to get student loan forgiveness in 2024  Here are the key details of Biden s newest plan to cancel student debt and why you shouldn t count on it just yet. Fewer would qualify for relief under plan B which the Biden administration has been working on since last summer. The plan has stricter eligibility criteria to target the most vulnerable borrowers. Around 10 million borrowers would qualify for at least 5000 in relief.  By contrast 43 million borrowers were eligible to get at least 10000 in relief through Biden s original relief plan.  Under the latest version of the proposal announced April 8 these groups of borrowers stand to get partial or full student loan forgiveness Borrowers with balances greater than what they originally borrowed. If the interest on your loan grew to be larger than your principal balance the government would erase up to 20000 above what you originally borrowed regardless of your income. If your income is up to 120000 as an individual or up to 240000 as a married couple your entire unpaid interest balance would be forgiven if you enroll in an incomedriven repayment IDR plan like SAVE. This relief would be automatic as long as you qualify. Up to 25 million borrowers could get some relief under this section of the proposal and 23 million could have their entire balance growth erased.  Borrowers who ve been in repayment for at least 20 or 25 years. Your remaining balance would be erased if you took out your undergraduate student loans on or before Jul. 1 2005 and your graduate loans on or before Jul. 1 2000. Direct Loans and Direct Consolidation Loans would be eligible. More than 2.5 million borrowers have held student loans for 20 years or longer 1 million of which have already been approved for loan forgiveness via the onetime IDR account adjustment.  Borrowers who attend programs that did not provide sufficient financial value. If your university or program lost eligibility to participate in the Federal Student Aid program was denied recertification because it misled students or closed or left you no better off financially than someone with a high school diploma your student debt would be forgiven. Borrowers who never applied to other relief programs for which they re eligible. If you re eligible for targeted loan forgiveness programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness PSLF could have reached the loan forgiveness threshold for an IDR plan or are eligible for forgiveness through closed school discharge you d still get your relief even if you never applied for these programs. Forgiveness amounts would depend on the terms of the program for which you re eligible. This part of the plan would erase student debt for around 2 million borrowers. Borrowers who are experiencing financial hardship. If you are considered high risk for default you would be eligible for automatic cancellation. Those who have high debt and expenses like childcare and healthcare costs may also be considered. Millions would benefit from this rule the White House said. This relief may involve an application.   MORE Got a Student Loan Refund? Prepare to Pay it Back The White House is leveraging the Higher Education Act or HEA to push plan B forward. The 1965 legislation laid the foundation of the modern U.S. college funding system. It established and governs grants federal loans and other programs to help students pay for school and it empowers the secretary of education to compromise waive or release federal student loans. Biden s plan A would have canceled debt via the Heroes Act of 2003. Passed by Congress following the 911 attacks this law allows the secretary of education to waive or modify student debt obligations for borrowers affected by a war military operation or national emergency. The White House argued that the pandemic was a national emergency worthy of loan cancellation but the Supreme Court ultimately ruled this interpretation unconstitutional. Though the HEA also allows the secretary to waive federal student loans it doesn t include specific requirements like a national emergency. The government has called on the HEA to cancel student debt in specific instances before. The HEA allowed for the creation of the PSLF and IDR programs which erase student debt after eligible borrowers make payments for a set number of years. The HEA is also behind the 6 billion Sweet v. Cardona settlement in 2022 in which some 300000 defrauded borrowers will get their debt discharged and past loan payments reimbursed. The Biden administration will release an official version of this forgiveness plan in the coming months according to the April 8 announcement. Next the plan must go through a monthslong public comment period and future legal challenges could delay or derail the plan altogether. If the plan is finalized in its current form millions of borrowers could start getting relief as early as the fall of 2024. The outcomes of the upcoming 2024 U.S. presidential and congressional elections could also impact this plan.  Don t make any financial decisions based on the chance this plan B could happen. Instead look at the real options in front of you right now. For example millions of longtime borrowers are already getting their remaining debt canceled through a onetime IDR account adjustment. And for others options like PSLF and a new IDR plan called SAVE can lower your monthly payments and forgive your remaining debt after 10 to 25 years of repayment no plan A or B needed. Call your federal student loan servicer to discuss your options and go to StudentAid.gov for more information about student loan forgiveness programs.

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/08/bidens-student-loan-forgiveness-plan-could-erase-up-to-20000-in-interest.html, President Joe Biden unveiled his new plan to forgive student debt on Monday less than a year after the Supreme Court blocked his initial attempt.  Today too many Americans especially young people are saddled with unsustainable debts in exchange for a college degree Biden said from an event in Madison Wisconsin. Biden wants this aid package to survive any legal challenges. As a result the president has made the program narrower by targeting specific groups of borrowers for debt forgiveness including those facing financial hardship. But one of the provisions under the new plan could still reach up to 25 million Americans. That s Biden s intent to cancel runaway interest.  More from Personal FinanceWhy gas is so expensive in CaliforniaCredit card users face consequences from falling behindAfter Biden praises progress on inflation economists weigh in Consumer advocates have long criticized the fact that interest rates on federal student loans may exceed 8 which can make it tough for borrowers who fall behind or are on certain payment plans to reduce their balances. More than 25 million federal student borrowers owe more than they originally borrowed according to the Biden administration. It estimates that if its new plan is enacted as proposed borrowers will get up to 20000 of unpaid interest on their federal student debt forgiven regardless of their income. Certain low and middleincome borrowers may benefit even more. Single people who earn 120000 or less and married borrowers making 240000 or under could have the entire amount of interest that has accrued on their debt since they entered repayment canceled under Biden s plan. Borrowers would need to be enrolled in an incomedriven repayment plan to qualify but shouldn t have to apply for the relief.  Student debt interest capitalization has been keeping families from accessing their version of the American Dream said Jaylon Herbin director of federal campaigns at the Center for Responsible Lending. Erasing that debt will lessen the burden of student loan debt on millions of borrowers and allow them to pay off their loans in a timely manner.  In addition to the cancellation of interest Biden s new plan is also expected to forgive the debt of certain groups of borrowers including those who It s not entirely clear yet how financial hardship will be defined but it could include those burdened by medical debt or high child care expenses the Biden administration said. Biden originally attempted to cancel people s student debt through executive action but he s now turned to the rulemaking process. The next step in that procedure is for the Biden administration to issue a proposed rule on its plan which will be followed by a public comment period. The president hopes to begin forgiving student debt before the November election.

Higher education provides students many socioeconomic benefits and increases the global competitiveness of the United States but mounting student loan debt has sparked a debate over federal lending policies.

Kent NishimuraLos Angeles TimesGetty Images Written By CFR.org Editors Updated Last updated April 16 2024 940 am EST Print Email Share Summary For decades the U.S. government has helped students finance their higher education to bolster the country s economic competitiveness and national security.U.S. student loan debt has ballooned in recent years outpacing most other forms of consumer borrowing.President Joe Biden has launched several plans to provide student debt relief but they have sparked intense opposition and legal challenges. IntroductionStudent loan debt in the United States has grown enormously in recent years and is now one of the largest forms of consumer borrowing in the country. Though the benefits of a college education outweigh the costs in most cases many graduates are concerned about entering a weak job market and worry that lingering debt could hinder their financial futures.  Most economists see student loan programs as a sound investment in U.S. workers and essential for maintaining the country s competitive edge but questions remain about the appropriate level of federal involvement. A debate has also emerged over whether the government should forgive student loan debt and if so how much it should forgive. The Joe Biden administration has introduced several student debt forgiveness plans but its most sweeping proposal was struck down by the Supreme Court.  United States   Education   Renewing America   U.S. Economy   Competitiveness  Student debt has more than doubled over the last two decades. As of September 2023 fortythree million U.S. borrowers collectively owed more than 1.6 trillion in federal student loans. Adding private loans brings that amount above 1.7 trillion so that total student debt exceeds debt from auto loans and credit cards. Only home mortgage debt at more than 12 trillion is larger. Student debt is growing as more and more students attend college. In the late 1980s and early 1990s most high schoolers did not enroll at colleges or universities of those that did less than half borrowed money to do so. In 2022 almost twothirds of recent high school graduates were enrolled and most took out student loans.  The average student is also taking on more debt the balance per borrower rose 39 percent from 2008 to 2022 according to U.S. News World Report. Students are generally borrowing more because college tuition has grown many times faster than income. The cost of college and resulting debt is higher in the United States than in almost all other wealthy countries where higher education is often free or heavily subsidized. Meanwhile U.S. states pulled back funding for public universities and colleges in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Roughly one in five Americans holds student debt. Most students graduate with around 30000 in loans but a small portion of borrowers hold an outsize share of student debt. More than onethird of the total debt is held by the 7 percent of borrowers who owe more than 100000 according to the Washington Post. However borrowers with smaller amounts of debt often have a more difficult time repaying their loans as higher debt from graduate or professional degrees can pay off with much higher incomes. Students who do not complete their degrees often struggle the most their default rate is three times higher than those who graduate. Additionally the type of institution makes a difference in how much debt is owed. About half of outstanding student debt is held by people who went to private schools which enrolled just 23 percent of higher education students in 2021.   United States   Education   Renewing America   U.S. Economy   Competitiveness  There is also a racial disparity in student borrowing that many experts say is problematic and the result of decades of systemic discrimination. Black college students generally take on more debt than white students and they are more likely to struggle with loan repayment after graduating in part because they typically have lower levels of family wealth. Black Latinx and American Indian students are all more likely to default on their loans than white students. Most U.S. students have an incentive to borrow because higher education is typically required for the highestpaying jobs. A worker with a bachelor s degree earns 1.8 times the amount a person with a high school diploma does while those with doctorates or professional degrees earn more than double according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.  However analysts caution that the return on investment in terms of future income can vary widely depending on factors including a student s major and the institution they attended. A 2019 study PDF by Federal Reserve economists found that although a college education still provides a boost in earnings the increase in wealth a degree provides has declined significantly over the past fifty years due to the rising cost of college and the increase in other forms of consumer debt. The U.S. government invests in higher education for its people through needbased tuition grants student loan programs veterans benefits and research grants because an educated and highly skilled workforce promotes national prosperity. Highly educated workers provide greater tax revenues are generally more productive and civically engaged and are less reliant on social programs. Moreover postsecondary education is seen by most experts as fundamental to a dynamic innovative economy. Major U.S. research universities such as Duke Harvard and Stanford often anchor regional innovation clusters. The federal government began taking a large role in funding higher education after World War II. The Servicemen s Readjustment Act of 1944 commonly known as the GI Bill provided tuition assistance and many other benefits including lowinterest home loans to nearly eight million returning veterans. The program continues to pay tuition for hundreds of thousands of servicemembers and veterans each year.  However federal student lending did not begin until the Cold War. In response to the Soviet Union s launch of Sputnik in 1957 Congress passed the National Defense Education Act sweeping legislation that created federally funded student loan programs and supported national security related fields including science math and foreign languages. In 1965 the Lyndon B. Johnson administration expanded federal involvement at all levels of education with the Higher Education Act HEA which laid the foundation for the current system of federal student lending. Since then Congress has passed laws that expand loan eligibility and allow parents to borrow on behalf of their children.  The federal government also provides needbased aid in the form of Pell Grants which were established in 1972 and students do not have to repay. But funding levels for the program have not kept pace with the rising cost of college resulting in more students turning to loans. The U.S. government used to guarantee or subsidize private loans through the Federal Family Education Loan FFEL program but critics including President Barack Obama argued that this was a handout to commercial lenders and the program was ended in 2010. All federal student loans have since been issued directly by the Department of Education.  In response to the COVID19 pandemic the Donald Trump administration provided tens of millions of student borrowers with temporary relief from making payments on their loans. In one of his first acts in office President Biden extended the payment moratorium for federal student loan borrowers until October 2021. He also expanded it to include private loans made under the discontinued FFEL program that are in default closing a loophole that affected more than one million borrowers. The Biden administration extended the freeze multiple times with the final extension expiring in October 2023. Since then only half of borrowers have resumed payments many of the remainder have defaulted or involuntary entered forbearance.  Some education finance experts say the increase in federal student lending is making college less affordable for many by allowing institutions to artificially inflate tuition. William J. Bennett the secretary of education under President George H.W. Bush argued in 1987 that federal aid was shielding colleges from market pressures allowing them to charge ever increasing prices. The socalled Bennett hypothesis continues to be debated by education experts. A 2014 study found that federal aid led to tuition increases only at private forprofit schools though other research PDF has established a link between aid and rising tuition at public schools as well. Many experts and policymakers agree that both the rising cost of college and the existing volume of loans need to be addressed. They acknowledge that surging student debt is harming younger generations of students by preventing them from reaching their financial goals while exacerbating racial inequality. While older generations were generally able to pay their way through school or find jobs that enabled them to pay off their debts that no longer holds true for recent cohorts they argue. The combination of soaring tuition costs and the recessions caused by the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID19 pandemic have particularly affected the millennial and subsequent generations. Additionally student loans are more difficult to discharge in bankruptcy than other forms of consumer debt such as from credit cards because borrowers are required to prove undue hardship from their loans in court. However experts and policymakers differ in their proposals for how to address the problem. The most recent debate has centered on the issue of loan cancellation some have called for universal loan cancellation in varying amounts while others say only targeted relief is warranted. Still other experts have proposed systemwide reforms beyond canceling existing debt.  Largescale debt cancellation. Universal debt relief calls for a blanket cancellation of all existing student loans. Other largescale plans call for forgiving up to 50000 for all borrowers. Proponents argue that largescale debt cancellation would help advance racial and socioeconomic equality and boost the economy. Without the burden of student loans they say more people will be able to buy homes take entrepreneurial risks or save for retirement. Opponents counter that broad cancellation would be unfair to those who successfully paid off their student loans or who avoided debt altogether. They also say it would disproportionately benefit highearning Americans such as doctors and lawyers who may have large debts but would likely not struggle with their payments. Another concern is who would bear the cost since the price tag is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars. Targeted debt relief. These plans would forgive most or all debt for borrowers who make under a certain income supporters of targeted relief often advocate for incomedriven repayment IDR plans. IDRs allow borrowers to pay an amount proportional to their income and have their remaining balance cleared after ten years assuming they ve made all qualifying payments. While proponents argue that targeting the lowestincome borrowers is the fairest approach critics say that it would do little to stop universities from raising tuition and other costs. Systemic reforms. A 2020 report by the Aspen Institute proposed systemwide reforms such as limiting tuition rates at pub lic colleges increasing aid for lowincome students incentivizing employers to offer tuition assistance and restricting federalloanfund distribution to institutions that have a history of low postgraduation employment rates and other poor outcomes for students. Policymakers are now increasing their efforts to treat student loans like any other consumer debt creating pathways to discharge student debt by filing for bankruptcy. Other experts and lawmakers say public funding should be increased to for example make public colleges and universities tuitionfree.  Some analysts say the perception that college is the only path to a wellpaying job drives up demand and harms students who could be better served by other forms of education. In recent years politicians from both major parties including former President Trump have advocated increasing access to career and technical education also known as vocational education as an alternative to college. Indeed enrollment in trade programs has increased since 2020 even as enrollment at two and fouryear public institutions is yet to recover from the pandemic. In 2022 Biden proposed a landmark executive order to cancel close to onethird of the federal government s student loan holding worth 441 billion. His plan would have forgiven up to 20000 in student debt for Pell Grant recipients and up to 10000 for non Pell Grant recipients making less than 125000 per year. The program was expected to help around forty million borrowers nearly half of whom would have had their entire debt forgiven. The estimated 400 billion outlay PDF drew fierce opposition from critics who viewed the program as an inflationary burden on taxpayers. In June 2023 the Supreme Court struck down the plan in a 63 vote ruling that the president did not have the statutory authority to cancel student loan debt.  In response Biden introduced a new scaleddown plan to reduce U.S. student loan debt which launched in August 2023. Under the socalled SAVE plan borrowers with undergraduate loans could see their monthly payments cut by as much as half with loan balances forgiven after ten or twenty years of payments depending on income level. The White House anticipates that the plan will allow borrowers to repay 0.71 per dollar borrowed though some analysts expect lower repayment rates. Projections of the program s cost vary but some place it even higher than that of the initial debt forgiveness plan. The Biden administration has estimated that it will cost 138 billion over the next ten years. Biden has also introduced a new process to forgive student loans outright for more than 30 million borrowers using authority from the HEA. As of April 2024 Biden has canceled a total of 153 billion in student debt for more than four million borrowers. Opponents raised concerns about the cost of the SAVE plan though experts say it stands on stronger legal footing than the previous debt forgiveness program. Critics also say that the new plan still burdens taxpayers and does little to reduce rapidly rising tuition costs. Some progressive lawmakers while applauding the plan say that it is not radical enough to fight the spiraling debt crisis. Meanwhile many analysts point out that any plan that aims to broadly cancel debt relief is likely to face legal challenges regardless of its legislative origin. To other experts student loan forgiveness would fail to address systemic issues. CFR s Roger W. Ferguson Jr. writes that such programs miss the fundamental weaknesses of higher education namely an unacceptably low completion rate overdependence on loans to attend college and high and rapidly increasing costs. He also pushes for upgrades to modernize the system used to manage student loans which he says could expedite both loan forgiveness and repayment saving borrowers up to 100 billion. Still proponents say IDRs such as SAVE are among the best options to reduce student debt. They argue that the Biden administration should now focus on reducing administrative hurdles to signing up for the program. A 2022 study by the Government Accountability Office found that thousands of borrowers who were eligible for forgiveness under existing IDRs were still making payments on their loans and that the Department of Education hasn t done enough to ensure that all eligible borrowers receive the forgiveness to which they are entitled.

However over the past 30 years college tuition prices have increased faster than median incomes leaving many Americans with large amounts of student debt that they struggle or are unable to pay off.  Recognizing the burden of this debt the BidenHarris Administration has pursued two key strategies for debt reduction and cancellation. The first student debt relief SDR aims to address the ill effects of flaws in the student debt system for borrowers. The second the SAVE plan reforms the federal student loan system improving student loan affordability for future students and providing current graduates with breathing room during the beginning of a new career. This issue brief examines the factors that precipitated the current student debt landscape and details how both SDR and SAVE will enhance the economic status of millions of Americans with student debt enabling them to allocate more funds towards basic necessities take career risks start businesses and purchase homes. This brief highlights credible research underscoring how the Administration s student debt relief could boost consumption in the shortterm by billions of dollars and could have important impacts on borrower mental health financial security and outcomes such as homeownership and entrepreneurship. This brief also details how the SAVE plan makes repaying college costs more affordable for current borrowers and future generations. CEA simulations show that under SAVE an average borrower with a bachelor s degree could save 20000 in loan payments while a borrower with an associate degree could see nearly 90 percent savings compared to the standard loan repayment plan. These changes enable more people to pursue education and contribute to the broader economy. Over the last 20 years especially the sticker price of college has risen significantly. Despite recent minor declines sticker prices at public universities which over 70 of undergraduate students in the United States attend are 56 higher today than two decades ago.1 While there are many reasons for this trend the most rapid increases in tuition often occur during economic downturns as tuitions grow to fill the budgetary holes that are left when states cut their support to public colleges Webber 2017 Deming and Walters 2018. This is especially problematic given many people choose to return to school during economic downturns Betts and MacFarland 1995 Hillman and Orians 2013. Unfortunately contracting state appropriations have played a role in shifting the responsibility of financing away from public subsidies and toward students and families Turner and Barr 2013 Bound et al. 2019 leading many students to take on more debt. At the same time that college sticker prices have risen the wage premium the earnings difference between college goers and high school graduates has not seen analogous growth. While obtaining a college degree remains a reliable entry point to the middle class the relative earning gains for degree holders began to stagnate in the early 2000s after increasing for several decades. As shown in Figure 1b since 2000 the wage premium for both bachelor s degree holders and those with some college education which includes anyone who enrolled in college but didn t earn a BA saw declines around the 200102 and 200810 recessions and a slow inconsistent recovery thereafter. The decline is particularly notable for students who didn t complete a fouryear degree a group that includes twoyear college enrollees who have among the highest student loan default rates.2 Traditional economic theory tells us that individuals choose to invest in postsecondary education based on the expected costs and wage returns associated with the investment. But rapid and unforeseeable rises in prices and declines in college wage premia have contributed to decades of unlucky collegeentry cohorts affected by a form of recessionary scarring. For example a student who entered college in 2006 would have expected a sticker price of roughly 8800 per year for a fouryear college but actually faced tuition of over 10000 in their final year of college a roughly 15 difference. This same student upon graduation if they worked full time would have earned about 3500 less on average than what they would have expected upon entering. This example illustrates that many borrowers made sound borrowing decisions with available information but as a result of these trends ended up with more debt than they could afford to pay off.3 Consistent with this notion the default rate for unlucky college entry cohorts of the 2000s is much higher than those of other cohorts with undergraduate default rates doubling between 2000 and 2010 in 2017 21 percent of undergraduate loan holders and 6 percent of graduate loan holders defaulted within 3 years CBO 2020. It is important to note that sticker prices for public institutions have declined 7 percent since 2021 the same period over which college wage premiums have been rising. Declining tuition for the first time in decades coincided with increased investment in higher education through pandemicera legislation such as the American Rescue Plan which allocated 40 billion in 2021 to support institutes of higher education and their students. Despite these improvements as well as significant advances in the return on college investments over the last three years many current borrowers still need some relief. The Administration has taken significant action to protect future cohorts from similar risks. Retrospective Student Debt Relief Helps Existing Borrowers In a commitment to help those who are overburdened with debt the Administration has already approved Federal student debt cancellation for nearly 4 million Americans through various actions. Today the Administration announced details of proposed rules that if finalized as proposed would provide relief to over 30 million borrowers when taken together with actions to date. Importantly much of this debt forgiveness comes from correcting program administration and improving regulations related to laws that were on the books before this Administration took office. This debt relief has affected borrowers from all walks of life including nearly 900000 Americans who have dedicated their lives to public service such as teachers social workers nurses firefighters police officers and others borrowers who were misled and cheated by their institutions and borrowers who are facing total or permanent disability including many veterans. By relieving these borrowers of longheld and in some cases very large burdens of debt relief can have significant meaning and impact for borrowers families and their communities. By reducing debtors liabilities debt relief raises net worth assets including income less liabilities. Debt relief can also ease the financial burden of making payments leading to greater disposable income for borrowers and their families which enhances living standards and could positively influence decisions about employment home buying and mobility. While there are few direct estimates of the effect of debt cancelation in the literature estimates based on the relationship between wealth and consumption suggest that this forgiveness could increase consumption by several billions of dollars each year in the next five to ten years. Additionally a recent study suggests that student debt cancellation can lead to increased earnings due to greater geographic and career mobility improved credit scores and lower delinquency rates on other debts Di Maggio Kalda and Yao 2019. This can facilitate access to capital for starting a business or buying a car or home. As home mortgages often require a certain debttoincome ratio and depend heavily on credit scores student debt cancellation could potentially increase home ownership. Indeed based on the mechanical relationship between housing industry affordability standards and debttoincome ratios industry sources have suggested that those without student debt could afford to take out substantially larger mortgages Zillow 2018. Other research also indicates a negative correlation between student loan debt and homeownership Mezza et al. 2020. It is important to note that while these pecuniary benefits are important the benefits associated with debt relief are not merely financial. Experimental evidence has linked holding debt to heightened levels of stress and anxiety Drentea and Reynolds 2012 worse selfreported physical health Sweet et al. 2013 and reduced cognitive capacity Robb et al. 2012 Ong et al. 2019. Studies also show that holding student debt can be a barrier to positive life cycle outcomes such as entrepreneurship Krishnan and Wang 2019 and marriage Gicheva 2016 Sieg and Wang 2018. Student debt relief has the potential to improve these key outcomes for millions of borrowers. Prospective The SAVE Plan Helps Prevent Future Challenges To address unaffordable education financing moving forward the Administration has also introduced the Saving on a Valuable Education SAVE loan repayment program. The SAVE plan prospectively helps student borrowers by ensuring that once they graduate they never have to pay more than they can afford towards their student loan debt. Importantly the SAVE plan protects borrowers from being unlucky by ensuring that high tuition or low earnings do not result in loan payments that borrowers can t afford. The CEA has detailed the real benefits of SAVE for borrowers in issue briefs and blogs underscoring that SAVE is the most affordable student loan repayment program in U.S. history. By substantially reducing monthly payment amounts compared to previous income driven repayment IDR plans and reducing time to forgiveness to as little as 10 years for people who borrowed smaller amounts the SAVE plan can mean tens of thousands of dollars in real savings for borrowers over the course of repayment. Figure 2 gives the example of two representative borrowers. Take the first a 4year college graduate who has 31000 in debt and earns about 40500 per year. Under a standard repayment plan this borrower would pay roughly 330 dollars each month for 10 years. Under SAVE this borrower would pay about 50 per month for the first ten years and on average about 130 per month for the next 10 years. Over a 20year period this borrower would make roughly 17500 less in payments not accounting for inflation over that period. This represents a 56 percent reduction in total payments compared to the standard repayment plan and includes considerable loan forgiveness. Similarly the representative 2year college graduate has 10000 in debt and earns about 32000 per year. Under a standard plan this borrower would pay 110 dollars each month for 10 years. Under SAVE this borrower would pay 0 per month for the first two years and under 20 per month for the next eight years before their debt is forgiven at year 10. Overall this borrower would be responsible for roughly 11700 less in lifetime payments not accounting for inflation. This borrower sees nearly 90 percent savings compared to the standard plan and receives considerable loan forgiveness. SAVE can also have benefits beyond the individual borrower. More money in borrowers pockets due to lower payment obligations under SAVE could boost consumption and give borrowers breathing room to make payments on other debt. This consumption effect is bolstered by a large literature documenting the benefits of easing liquidity constraints see for example Aydin 2022 Parker et al. 2022. Additionally by shortening time to forgiveness for undergraduate borrowers SAVE can lead to positive debtrelief outcomes as discussed above for many more borrowers. Another key aspect of incomedriven repayment plans like SAVE is that they protect borrowers from having to make large payments when incomes are low. Specifically the required payments are not based on the initial loan balance but on one s income and household size so that those cohorts who need to borrow more to pay for college do not make larger payments unless they make more income. SAVE also protects more of a borrower s income as discretionary and when the full plan is implemented in Summer 2024 will limit monthly payments on undergraduate loans to 5 percent of discretionary income. In fact for single borrowers who make less than 33000 per year the required monthly payments will be zero dollars. From a finance perspective the SAVE plan provides a form of insurance against tuition spikes and economic downturns taking some of the risk out of investing in one s education while also bringing costs down.  A common concern and one that could mute these benefits is that increases in the generosity of education financing may encourage institutions to raise tuition and fees in response a phenomenon commonly referred to as the Bennett Hypothesis for an excellent overview of research see Dynarski et al. 2022. Theoretically in a market when sellers are maximizing profits any policy that increases demand will also increase prices. However this is less likely to impact the over 70 of U.S. undergraduates who attend public colleges which are not profitdriven and often have statutorily set tuition. Consistent with this notion the evidence in support of the Bennett Hypothesis primarily comes from forprofit colleges which are highly reliant on students who receive federal financial aid Cellini and Goldin 2014 Baird et al 2022.4 Importantly although the forprofit sector enrolls some of the country s most vulnerable students enrollment in the sector in 2021 accounted for only 5 percent of total undergraduate enrollment suggesting that aggregate tuition increases in response to changes in education financing may be modest. Furthermore the BidenHarris Administration has taken action to crack down on forprofit colleges that take advantage of or mislead their students. And recent regulations such as the Gainful Employment GE rule add safeguards against unaffordable debt regardless of more generous education financing.  Although the SAVE plan stands to benefit borrowers of all backgrounds the plan has important racial and socioeconomic equity implications because it is particularly beneficial for those borrowers with the lowest incomes. Centuries of inequities have led to Black Hispanic and Native households being more likely than their White peers to fall in the low end of the income distribution. This means that mechanically the SAVE plan s benefits could accrue disproportionately to these groups. Indeed using completion data from recent years an Urban Institute analysis estimates that 59 percent of credentials earned by Black students and 53 percent of credentials earned by Hispanic students are likely to be eligible for some amount of loan forgiveness under SAVE compared to 42 percent of credentials earned by White students Delisle and Cohn 2023. Finally the interest subsidy described in an August 2023 CEA blog prevents ballooning balances when a borrower cannot cover their entire monthly interest payment a phenomenon that has historically led to many borrowers in general and Black borrowers in particular to see loan balances that are higher than their original loan amount even several years out from graduating with a bachelor s degree NCES 2023. The benefits associated with SDR and SAVE for millions of Americans are considerable. In the short run under both SDR and SAVE those who receive relief may be able to spend more in their communities and contribute to their local economies. Summing the likely consumption effects of the Administration s student debt relief and SAVE programs results in billions of dollars in additional consumption annually. Despite the modest effect on the macroeconomy as a whole note that the U.S. economy is roughly 28 trillion with a population of roughly 320 million these consumption effects represent incredibly meaningful impacts on individual borrowers financial security and the economic wellbeing of their communities. SAVE because it brings down the cost of taking out loans to go to college has the potential to lead to longerterm economic growth if it leads to greater educational attainment. This increased attainment can occur both through improved retention and completion of postsecondary education and also the movement of students into college who would not have otherwise enrolled. There is a long macroeconomics literature linking educational attainment in a nation to GDP growth see for example Lucas 1988 Hanushek and Woesmann 2008. While identifying the causal effect of schooling on GDP is challenging researchers using a variety of approaches find that a oneyear increase in average education for the entire working population would increase the real GDP level by between 5 and 12 percent Barro and Lee 2013 Soto 2002 a result that is in line with the microfounded relationship between years of education and earnings Lovenheim and Smith 2022. To put this relationship in perspective and highlight the growth potential of increasing educational attainment the CEA simulated the hypothetical effect on GDP of increasing the collegegoing rate by 1 3 and 5 percentage points respectively. This range represents the kinds of changes in college going that have been observed over several years the college enrollment rate for 18 to 24yearolds declined 4 percentage points between 2011 and 2021 after increasing by 6 percentage points between 2000 and 2011 NCES 2023. CEA simulations show that by 2055 a policy that increased the college going rate by 1 3 and 5 percentage points could increase the level of GDP in 2055 thirty years from now by 0.2 0.6 and 1 percent respectively. This represents hundreds of billions of dollars of additional economic activity in the long run. While increased growth is an exciting possibility it would only occur insofar as SAVE leads to increased educational attainment which is uncertain. The academic literature has found that student loans can promote academic performance Barr et. al. 2021 and increase educational attainment by increasing transfers from 2year to 4year colleges and increasing college completion among enrollees Marx and Turner 2019. At the same time increases in collegegoing due to SAVE are by no means guaranteed. While historically policies that reduce the cost of college through direct means such as providing students with generous grant aid or reducing tuition have succeeded at raising college enrollment levels Dynarski 2003 Turner 2011 a pair of recent studies show that prospective students may only respond to cost changes when they are salient i.e. they are framed and marketed in the right way Dynarski et al. 2021 and relatively certain Burland et al. 2022. However evidence suggests that there is demand for plans like SAVE Balakrishnan et al. 2024 particularly as SAVE can provide sizable benefits to borrowers in terms of reducing their longterm debt burden and keep monthly payments low dependent on a borrower s income after they finish school. This highlights the importance of communicating the benefits of the SAVE program to prospective students who otherwise would not enroll in college due to cost concerns including potential barriers to paying off student loans in the future. Doing so could lead to meaningful increases in college enrollment and the resulting improvements in productive capacity could increase the size of the U.S. economy for years to come. The BidenHarris Administration has taken bold action to address a student debt problem that has been decades in the making. This student debt cancellation will provide welldeserved relief for borrowers who have paid their fair share many of whom had the proverbial rug pulled out from under them with concurrent rapidly rising tuition and declining returns to a college degree. The relief has and will improve economic health and wellbeing of those who have devoted years of their life to public service those who were defrauded or misled by their institutions and those who have been doing all they can to make payments but have still seen their loan balances grow. Looking to future generations the Administration implemented the SAVE plan to protect borrowers against tuition spikes and poorer than expected labor market outcomes that often plague students graduating into a period of economic downturn Rothstein 2021 Schwandt and von Wachter 2023. Both student debt relief and SAVE will enhance the economic status of millions of Americans with student debt enable them to allocate more funds towards basic necessities take career risks start businesses and purchase homes with the understanding that they will never have to pay more than they can afford towards their student loans. Moreover the SAVE plan makes repayment more affordable for future generations which helps borrowers manage monthly payments but also enables more people from all walks of life to explore their full potential and pursue higher education enhancing the potential of the U.S. workforce and the economy more broadly.  1 In 2021 51 of total undergraduates attended public 4year universities and 21 attended public 2years in 2021. 2 The BA group excludes those with a graduate degree or any education beyond a bachelor s degree. 3 Recent research shows that despite a positive return on investment ROI for many including the average student the distribution of ROI has widened over the last several decades such that the likelihood of negative ROI is higher than it has historically been particularly so for underrepresented minority students Webber 2022. 4 There is also some evidence in support of the Bennett Hypothesis at the graduate level Black et al. 2023.

https://www.investopedia.com/the-impact-of-cancelling-student-debt-5101053,  On Aug. 24 2022 the BidenHarris administration announced its longterm student debt relief plan but it was overruled by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2023. The plan featured three prongs  The application process for student loan forbearance was briefly opened but legal challenges prompted the U.S. Department of Education to stop accepting applications indefinitely and pause processing applications that already were submitted. President Biden announced the Saving on a Valuable Education SAVE Plan on June 30 2023 which officially became available to student loan borrowers in August 2023. The plan cuts payments on undergraduate loans in half reduces some borrowers monthly loan payments to 0 ensures that balances don t grow as long as payments are kept up to date and provides early forgiveness for lowbalance borrowers.  While the debt forgiveness plan was ultimately rejected by the Supreme Court the administration continued to pursue alternative measures for debt relief through loan forgiveness and incomedriven repayment IDR plans. The pause on student loan interest ultimately ended on Sept. 1 2023 and payments resumed on Oct. 1 2023.  Note that while the American Rescue Plan makes student loan forgiveness granted from Jan. 1 2021 to Dec. 31 2025 taxfree at the federal level some states may see it differently. Currently forgiveness is expected to be taxed as income in Arkansas California Indiana Minnesota Mississippi North Carolina and Wisconsin.  Student loan forgiveness would apply to certain federal loans held by the Department of Education. Private loans are ineligible for forgiveness.  Though plenty of borrowers owe more than 10000 any sort of student loan forgiveness would benefit them financially. Some economists believe loan forgiveness also would stimulate the economy as borrowers could use that money for other purposes such as buying a home.  For example if you have 35000 in student loan debt and pay 300 per month on the loan with a 4.66 interest rate over the course of 13 years you ll pay almost 12000 in interest. By canceling 10000 of that student debt you could save about 6000 and pay off the rest of your debt five years sooner.  Canceling student debt could be of particular benefit to lowerincome borrowers especially women and people of color. An academic paper in 2020 maintained that the median wealth for Black households overall not just borrowers would instantly increase by 42 with 75000 in student debt forgiveness and around 34 with 50000 in forgiveness. Those are higher amounts than President Biden has suggested but would be in keeping with his administration s initiatives to address racial equity. Refinancing your federal student loans into private student loans could mean losing eligibility for student loan forgiveness.  Critics argue against canceling any amount of student loan debt in part because it would unduly benefit a relatively privileged class of people college students. While more than 45 million Americans have at least some student loan debt they represent only approximately 13.5 of the U.S. population.  In addition to concern regarding the fairness of the plan it also is not without its costs. Fiscal experts estimate that loan cancellation would cost 519 billion over the course of a 10year budget window. Add another 16 billion in forbearance for 2022 and potentially another 450 billion for the new incomedriven repayment IDR program and the total sticker price could be near 1 trillion.  That potential trillion dollars in forgiveness has to come from somewhere. Current estimates state that forgiveness will cost roughly 2500 per taxpayer whether they went to college or not.  While forgiving student loans may have an impact on current borrowers an analysis by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said they would expect student loan debt to return to 1.6 trillion by 2028. Since the plan does nothing to dampen higher education costs it has no impact on current and future students facing historically high education costs.  Student loan debt cancellation may have another negative impact higher inflation rates. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that the influx of 10000 to 20000 for millions of borrowers could push inflation rates even higher with personal consumption expenditure PCE inflation increasing by 15 to 27 basis points. If federal student loan forgiveness does not go through and you are not able to get relief then you may want to consider loan consolidation or student loan refinancing. Yes. The student debt relief plan applies only to federal loans held by the U.S. Department of Education. Those loans include undergraduate and graduate direct loans Federal Family Education Loans FFELs and Perkins Loans held by the Department of Education and certain defaulted loans held by the Department of Education. Three of the major arguments in favor of broad student debt cancellation are It depends. Borrowers who are already enrolled in the Revised Pay as You Earn REPAYE plan will be automatically enrolled in the new Saving on a Valuable Education SAVE Plan. Other borrowers will have to submit an application in order to qualify for forgiveness.  Though there is a general consensus that higher education reform particularly in regard to costs is desirable experts are divided as to whether canceling some or all student loan debt is the best way to go about it. While those receiving forgiveness will see a financial benefit there may be longerreaching ramifications that will be more costly for all taxpayers in the long run.
