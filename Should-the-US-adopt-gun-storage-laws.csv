Gun violence is the leading cause of death of children in America. That is why the BidenHarris Administration is taking comprehensive action to prevent gun violence affecting children. Approximately 4.6 million children live in homes with unsecured firearms. Studies show that safe storage can dramatically reduce children s risk of selfinflicted harm and unintentional shootings.Safe storage of firearms can physically prevent youth from accessing firearms helping to keep youth schools and communities safe from gun violence. Unsecured guns are also closely associated with school shootings youth suicide unintentional shootings and theft of firearms. New Actions to Reduce Gun Violence and Save LivesLocal leaders like school officials community and faith leaders and law enforcement can be trusted credible messengers when it comes to providing guidance on gun violence prevention and safe firearm storage options. Today the BidenHarris Administration is announcing three actions to help further promote safe storage and protect children To highlight these new actions First Lady Jill Biden White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention Director Stefanie Feldman and U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona will join a town hall with school principals at the White House. The town hall will elevate the importance of safe firearms storage and emphasize the role that principals and education leaders can play in helping prevent gun violence. A livestream of the town hall is available here School Principals Town Hall with the Office of Gun Violence Prevention the Department of Education YouTubeBuilding on a Record of Action to Promote Safe Storage of FirearmsThese new actions build on the BidenHarris Administration s commitment to promoting safe storage of firearms including The BidenHarris Administration will continue to take action to promote safe storage and calls on Congress to assist these efforts by passing a national safe storage law to create accountability for those who leave firearms unsecured. In addition the Administration is working with state and local leaders on safe storage efforts.In December Vice President Harris the Office of Gun Violence Prevention and the Office of Intergovernmental Affairs convened 100 state legislators to announce the BidenHarris Administration s Safer States Initiative to reduce gun violence and save lives. The Administration urged states to enact and implement strong laws requiring firearms owners to safely store their firearms in their homes and vehicles. The laws should impose a clear standard to penalize those who do not safely store their weapons and whose weapons end up being used for violence. While safe gun storage is an important factor in curtailing death and injuries among children the BidenHarris Administration through the American Rescue Plan the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act and other grant programs has also provided unprecedented funding to establish safe healthy and supportive learning opportunities and environments to increase access to schoolbased mental health services and to strengthen the pipeline of mental health professionals in highneed communities. These historic investments provide greater access to the services and supports that help keep students safe and healthy. These investments help advance the President s Mental Health Strategy which directly implements his Unity Agenda for the nation by helping to tackle the mental health crisis.

The presence of firearms in the home poses an increased risk to a child and asking a parent a question about gun ownership can open up an opportunity to educate parents about potential dangers to which their child is exposed. Anticipatory guidance is a major component of pediatric care and helps patients and their families know what to watch for in the future.

https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/gun-policy-in-america.html,  Visitors stand in line outside the U.S. Supreme Court on November 27 2017 the day the court declined to hear a challenge to Maryland s 2013 state ban on assault weapons. In addition to their many uses guns have symbolic cultural and economic importance in the United States. Many Americans value the traditions of hunting sport shooting and collecting guns and appreciate the security and protection that they can provide. Many regions rely on hunting as an important driver of the tourism economy and the wider gun industry employs hundreds of thousands of Americans including instructors and shooting range operators hunting equipment suppliers and manufacturers distributors and retailers of firearms and ammunition.  At the same time each year many Americans suffer grievous injuries and lose friends and family members in incidents involving firearms. According to vital statistics data reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention more than 48800 people died of gunshot wounds in the United States in 2021. More than half of these deaths were suicides. According to a 2016 study by Erin Grinshteyn and David Hemenway those living in the United States are seven times more likely to die by homicide than if they lived in another wealthy country and they are 25 times more likely to die in a gun homicide. Indeed the risk of experiencing gun violence in the United States is so high and so pervasive that even the mass public shootings that occur so regularly and that capture so much attention account for just one half of 1 percent of all U.S. gun fatalities annually. There are many reasons why people disagree about how to reduce the harms associated with gun violence but among the biggest is disagreement about the true effects of gun policies on a range of outcomes. Virtually no one believes that these levels of violence and sorrow should be tolerated not gun owners not gunrights advocates and certainly not those who believe guns are a root cause of these problems. But there is passionate disagreement about what should be done. There are many reasons why people disagree about how to reduce the harms associated with gun violence but among the biggest is disagreement about the true effects of different gun laws and regulations gun policies on a range of outcomes. The RAND Gun Policy in America initiative is designed to provide the mostobjective information possible about what is and isn t known about the likely effects of commonly discussed gun laws to create tools and resources to improve the quality of research in this area and ultimately to improve the national debate on developing fair and effective gun policies.  Views on gun policies frequently divide along political and partisan lines. Some of this split could be the result of differing values concerning which goals and outcomes are more important for example protecting personal liberties or reducing community violence. However from a survey we conducted of gun policy experts we found that those differing values are not the primary source of disagreement. That is disagreements between experts favoring the policy positions of the National Rifle Association and those favoring the positions of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence do not stem from different views about the objectives that gun policies should aim to achieve. Instead experts disagree about what the true effects of different gun policies will be. Both groups prefer policies that they believe will reduce gun violence but one believes that eliminating gunfree zones for instance will accomplish this objective while the other believes that such a policy would have the opposite effect. This is a disagreement about facts not about values or objectives.  As Dan Kahan and his colleagues at Yale University and others have shown disagreements about factual matters concerning gun policy or other science controversies may persist even when credible evidence is available people may become strongly motivated to reject factual claims that contradict their or their social groups longheld beliefs especially when those beliefs have become central to the groups identity. Nevertheless the fact that gun policy debates appear to be grounded in disagreement about the effects of policies rather than about their objectives suggests an important role for the scientific study of gun laws especially where evidence is currently weak. However our review of thousands of published studies originally released in 2018 and updated in 2020 and 2023 showed that there is still much to learn about the effects of gun policies. Indeed after restricting our review to studies designed to measure the causal effects of policies we found scientific evidence for relatively few of the more than 150 effects we examined.  Furthermore many of the possible effects of gun policies that are raised in policy debates have only rarely or never been studied rigorously. These understudied and unstudied outcomes in our review included the effects of laws on police shootings of civilians on a gun owner s ability to use his or her weapon defensively and on participation in hunting and sport shooting. Despite the importance of these outcomes to influential stakeholders in gun policy debates little scientific research has been conducted to clarify how these outcomes would likely be affected by gun laws read more in our essay on the scientific evidence for the effects of gun policies. The fact that gun policy debates appear to be grounded in disagreement about the effects of policies rather than about their objectives suggests an important role for the scientific study of gun laws. Even for outcomes that have been better studied such as suicides homicides and unintentional injuries often only one or two studies met our criteria for providing evidence of a policy s effects and these studies often provided inconclusive contradictory or otherwise limited evidence. Nevertheless we did find that the weight of available evidence suggests that some policies have specific effects. For instance we concluded that there is credible evidence that childaccess prevention laws which require guns to be stored safely have positive measurable benefits in reducing unintentional and intentional selfinjuries and deaths among young people. However the effects of these laws on defensive gun use one of the principal objections raised against childaccess prevention laws have not been evaluated rigorously leaving policymakers without a complete picture of the laws total possible effects.  The comparatively modest scientific evidence available on most gun policies does not of course mean that these policies are ineffective. It may be for example that the policies do have the intended effects on those seeking to acquire a new firearm but because new firearms represent such a small proportion of the total stock of guns held by civilians in the United States estimated by the Small Arms Survey to be more than 393 million firearms in 2017 the effects are hard to discern. For example laws designed to change who may buy new firearms which guns they may buy or how gun sales occur could predictably have only a small effect on for example homicide rates which may be affected much more by the existing stock of firearms. So although small effects are especially difficult to identify with the data and methods common in this field that does not mean the effects are unimportant Even a 1percent reduction in homicides nationally would correspond to approximately 2500 fewer violent deaths over a decade.  Beyond the fact that it is often difficult to identify the true effects of gun laws using available data and research methods it is also true that gun policy as a whole is understudied. This is partly a result of congressional appropriations language the socalled Dickey Amendment renewed continuously since its introduction in 1996 that chilled U.S. government investment in gun policy research until December 2019 when Congress appropriated 25 million to study gun violence and prevention. Indeed in recent decades the U.S. government has spent far less on gun policy research than it has on research involving causes of similar levels of mortality in the United States such as traffic accidents or sepsis meaning that published studies on gun policy are correspondingly rare as detailed in a 2017 study by David Stark and Nigam Shah and in another by Ted Alcorn. Researchers review the challenges to the scientific study of gun policies and recommend ways to improve this body of research.  There are other obstacles to researching the effects of gun policies however such as the lack of reliable information about when states implemented different laws and the differences among researchers for classifying a specific law or provision as belonging to one or another group of gun policies. We found an exception to this problem in the available research for shallissue concealedcarry or righttocarry laws we suspect this is because the original developers of a data set on state implementation of shallissue laws made their data set available to other researchers who have further improved it and made it available for others to use. Perhaps partly as a result of the widespread availability of this data set we found vastly more research on shallissue concealedcarry laws than on any other gun policy. Indeed while we identified 64 studies that examined the effects of concealedcarry laws using rigorous methods the next most commonly studied policy background checks had just 26 studies and the next beyond that had fewer than 20 licensing and permitting requirements and standyourground laws.  Faced with the difficulty of assembling reliable historical information on state implementation of gun policies we developed a database of state gun laws that covers 1979 to 2020 and further updates and expanded policies are on the horizon. The database cites and quotes every law that we have categorized indicating the date when it became effective and whether the law implemented modified or repealed a policy. We have now deployed the database as an opensource resource that others can use for their own research and to increase its breadth and accuracy other researchers can and do contribute. This is one of several products we have developed as part of the Gun Policy in America initiative that should foster innovation and improvement in gun policy research.  In undertaking the RAND Gun Policy in America project we hope to begin to build consensus around a shared set of facts about gun policy by demonstrating where scientific evidence is accumulating developing new estimates and resources for use by other researchers and highlighting areas where investment in research by the U.S. government foundations and philanthropists could produce more and better information and make important contributions to establishing fair and effective gun policies in the United States.

https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23691442/gun-violence-secure-storage-laws-suicides-unintentional-shootings, The scorchedearth fight over gun control obscures a key idea that could actually save lives prioritizing gun storage. Growing up in Florida my twin sister and I never knew there were guns kept in our home. My father s unloaded firearms a .22 pistol and a 20gauge shotgun were stored in a locked cabinet in the garage behind an array of boxes bikes and golf clubs. He worked across the country in California and he kept the key with him at all times.  By most standards my father s weapons were safely stored but he was in the minority of gun owners 54 percent of the approximately 77 million gun owners in the US do not practice safe gun storage according to a 2018 Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health survey. And onethird of these households with dangerously stored guns are also home to children.  This is a fact that should alarm us. In 2020 firearms surpassed car accidents as the leading cause of death for American children with 4357 children killed by gunfire that year. While the majority of child deaths from guns are due to homicide an average of 35 percent between 2018 and 2021 were suicides while 5 percent were caused by unintentional accidental shootings.   I often reflect on the day that our children walked out the door and one of my children returned home and for the other I was picking out a casket said Julvonnia McDowell a volunteer with the gun safety movement Moms Demand Action whose 14yearold son JaJuan McDowell was unintentionally shot and killed in 2016 by another teen who was playing with an unsecured gun. Every time I say this my heart breaks because our children deserve to live. They shouldn t have to die like this.   JaJuan left and his mother Julvonnia McDowell. JaJuan was unintentionally shot and killed in 2016 by another teen playing with an unsecured gun. Courtesy of Julvonnia McDowell Despite the horrific toll of firearm violence America remains deeply divided on guns and hopes for any kind of comprehensive gun control reform is dim. But the US could reduce gun violence both youth suicides and unintentional shootings by adopting stricter secure storage laws and educating gun owners about proper storage methods.  That s why the national gun control advocacy organization Everytown for Gun Safety on Wednesday released a new report on preventing unintentional shootings by children which was first shared with Vox. The group found that nine of the 10 states with the lowest number of unintentional shootings by adolescents have some form of secure storage protection. In contrast the 10 states with the highest rates of unintentional shootings by children have very limited or no secure storage laws.  And while tougher laws and norms to better store guns would do nothing about the sheer number of firearms in America storage safety offers a rare opportunity to find political consensus on guns. Often people feel like nothing can happen in the gun debate and while it s true that the state of gun laws in the US remains weak relative to our peers around the world that doesn t mean that change is impossible said Matthew Lacombe the author of Firepower How the NRA Turned Gun Owners Into a Political Force. But as bleak as things seem and as dire and scary as this problem is we re in a better position to keep putting in the work to make change happen.  While American gun owners and nongun owners disagree about many gun restrictions they actually find common ground when it comes to gun storage a 2019 APM Research Lab survey on Americans views on gun policies found. Over half of gun owners and nongun owners support speaking to their children about gun safety keeping guns in a locked place and taking gun safety courses. That means most American adults support at least one pillar of what Johanna Thomas a licensed certified social worker gun owner and volunteer with Moms Demand Action calls the gold standard of firearm storage keeping stored firearms unloaded and locked away with ammunition kept separately and locked as well. An unloaded weapon prevents someone from using the device if they do not know how to load it while keeping ammunition separate prevents unauthorized users who do know how to load a gun from doing so. For a firearm to be locked it needs to be stored in a locked cabinet or safe or at minimum with a trigger lock that needs to be removed.  Gun locks prevent a gun from being fired. Ryan McFaddenMediaNews GroupReading Eagle via Getty Images These three rules unloaded locked and separate have been shown by researchers to provide protection for children who live in the home where guns are stored. And while some gun owners may argue that locking a weapon could put them in peril if they need to use it quickly evidence from Everytown s report shows that an unsecured weapon does not make an individual safer or more capable of defending themselves.   When I tell people I keep my gun in a safe and I keep the ammunition stored separately there are always questions about that says Thomas. But I can tell them I have access to my firearm in three seconds if I need it. Those three seconds also help me to decide do I actually need my firearm? That s time enough Thomas says to give her the opportunity to determine whether a possible intruder is actually her child or spouse entering her home.  In the first four months of this year alone guns killed more than 13200 people 470 of whom were teens ages 12 to 17 and 81 of whom were children. Of these thousands of deaths 234 are from the 173 mass shootings that have occurred in the US this year so far. These mass shootings including the recent March Nashville school shooting the 377th school shooting since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting often make national headlines.  However suicides are a significant and overlooked portion of American gun deaths and account for well over half of all annual gun deaths. An encouraging finding from a RAND Corporation report is that child access prevention laws laws that require guns to be made inaccessible to children reduce the rate of suicides among young people in states where they are implemented simply by making it more difficult for a child or adolescent in mental distress to get access to a weapon that could instantly end their lives.   Part of what I think makes gun storage laws or safe gun storage practices important is that the studies show that they can help reduce the risk of adolescent suicide and that isn t necessarily what we think of when we think of a gun violence problem in this country said Lacombe. I think gun storage is an example of a policy that could make a real difference in terms of combating one of these underdiscussed but unfortunately really common types of gun misuse.  Currently 25 states and Washington DC require gun owners to take responsibility for the secure storage of their guns to some capacity. These laws range in intensity and level of protection with the most comprehensive enacted in Massachusetts and Oregon where gun owners are required to secure their guns when they are not in possession of the weapon. In Massachusetts the penalty for not properly securing a gun ranges from a 2500 fine to 15 years in prison depending on the type of gun.  Along with reducing suicides these two states with the strongest policies have a 78 percent lower rate of unintentional shootings when compared to states without secure storage laws.  Secure storage laws are some of the most evidenceproven gun safety laws that there are said Sarah BurdSharps senior director of research for Everytown. I think the hopeful news of this report is that nearly all of these shootings are preventable.  When you send your children to someone else s home you often ask questions to keep them safe Do you have pets? Do you have a pool and if so how is it secured? My child has an allergy do you have peanuts in your house? All of those things are routine says BurdSharps. Asking about firearms and how they re stored should be another routine safety precaution.   It s a difficult conversation but it s one that we have to have said Thomas a mom to a 13yearold and 10yearold who has this conversation every time she sends her children to a new home or in a new vehicle. In the few cases where Thomas felt a firearm was not stored properly she found alternative solutions such as driving her child herself or proposing an outdoor play date.  One way to make this conversation easier is to communicate via text and share information about your own home first Thomas added. Anytime my children are going to visit somebody else s home or I have children coming to my home I offer up that information she said. A lot of times my conversation starts with We have three dogs in our home we have a pool it has an alarm we have all of our liquor stored in a locked cabinet medications are put in a safe we have two firearms they re stored in our closet. Guns are in one safe and ammunition is in another. Kids don t have access.  Volunteering this information means parents often offer it in return without having to be asked she said. Parents can also find more information on how to lead this conversation through Everytown s gun storage campaign Be SMART BurdSharps added.  On top of checking in with other adults parents should also be educating their children about the dangers of firearms and the need to find and notify an adult if they see an unsecured firearm. I think that with children you have to have that conversation about the dangers of guns said McDowell. But she adds I always lead this back to it s always the adults responsibility to prevent unauthorized access to guns and not a curious child s responsibility to avoid guns.   We should talk to our kids about gun safety but it s a precaution it is not a guarantee Thomas agreed. The onus is on adults to keep children safe always at every point.  Parents aren t the only ones who should be leading these conversations. Everyone should be taking up the task. In fact most gun owners believe law enforcement hunting and outdoor organizations activeduty military and veterans would be good messengers for information on safe storage practices.  Health care professionals also play a critical role in promoting safe firearm storage said Thomas Delaney an associate professor of pediatrics who does suicide prevention work at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont.   Particularly when there are children or youth in the home or people with identified risk for suicide health care professionals have an opportunity to ask How are firearms in the home stored? and then provide guidance about how improving storage practices can increase the safety of everyone in the home said Delaney. Health care providers in general have a lot of credibility and often trustful relationships with patients built up over many years and their guidance can be a powerful tool for increasing safe storage and downstream helping prevent suicide deaths homicide deaths and theft or improper accessing of firearms.  McDowell who knows the devastation of these unintentional shootings firsthand agrees that it is everyone s job to educate and be concerned about this issue.   I honor JaJuan by using my voice to talk to Americans all over the country from all walks of life about secure storage of firearms said McDowell. For me taking action isn t a choice it s my new path my new mission. But gun violence is an issue that we all need to worry about.  Will you support Vox today?

https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/01/21/gun-owners-lock-up-weapons-laws/, But it isn t the gun owners who have stood in the way of their own accountability. In fact the vast majority would embrace it. Twothirds who responded to a 2019 poll said they supported a mandate for all of them to secure their firearms and yet four years later amid the worst stretch of school shootings in history fewer than half the states in the country have passed any such law. The reason is simple according to gunsafety researchers and lawmakers who have tried for years to pass safestorage legislation Conservative politicians fear the political power of gun lobbyists who oppose those regulations more than they fear constituents who support them.  This is all about politics and culture wars said Daniel Webster codirector of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. The basic rationality and our general instinct that we want to protect our kids gets sadly pushed aside.  The widespread unwillingness of state legislatures to pass the laws driven in part by a small but fierce core of gun rights devotees key to the Republican base is especially frustrating for Webster and other researchers who have collected a growing body of evidence showing that those regulations reduce the risk that children will shoot themselves or others unintentionally or on purpose. Two kids a loaded gun and the man who left a 4yearold to die For students the consequences of inaction have been dire. If children as young as 6 didn t have access to guns more than half the country s school shootings since 1999 would not have happened according to an analysis by The Washington Post. In the past two years alone at least 45 acts of gun violence on K12 campuses would have been prevented sparing 51 people from being shot and 44000 children from being exposed to the terror and trauma of those incidents. The effects extend far beyond the classroom though. Since 2000 more than 11000 children have ended their own lives with guns and thousands more have shot themselves or others by accident. Gun violence is now the leading cause of death for young children and teenagers in the United States. Last week the family of the 6yearold boy accused of shooting his teacher in Newport News Va. released a statement asserting that the gun had been secured. In an interview with The Post the family s attorney said the weapon had been stored on the top shelf of a closet and was fitted with a trigger lock but the family has not explained how a child that young could have figured out how to remove the lock. Va. school ignored warnings boy had gun before he shot teacher attorney says Most trigger locks require a key a threedigit code or a fingerprint scan to open. It remains unclear whether prosecutors will charge anyone with a crime in the case. The Post reviewed every school shooting since the Columbine High massacre nearly 24 years ago and identified just 10 instances in which the adult owners of the weapons were criminally charged because they had failed to lock up their firearms. Six of those prosecutions stemmed from shootings committed by kids younger than 11 even though children in that age group are responsible for only about 3 percent of the total number of shootings. Virginia has adopted a law intended to prevent children from obtaining guns but it is considered among the weakest in the country. The statute prohibits people from recklessly leaving a loaded unsecured firearm somewhere that could endanger a child under the age of 14. It does not however require that people lock up their guns nor does it do anything to protect older teens who are at a higher risk of suicide and are far more likely to commit mass shootings. A 6yearold is accused of shooting someone at school. He isn t the first. Virginia Democrats have proposed bills this session to strengthen the state s law just as they have in previous years. But despite fresh public demands for action in the aftermath of the shooting at Richneck Elementary Del. Schuyler VanValkenburg a Henrico County Democrat sponsoring one of those bills has little hope that it will succeed. To pass VanValkenburg said the proposal would first have to survive a House subcommittee controlled by a GOP majority. All seven Republican members of that subcommittee have ties to the National Rifle Association Each belongs to the organization has been endorsed by it or has received a sterling rating from it. Four have also taken NRA donations.  It s a very old legislative tactic said VanValkenburg a high school history and government teacher outside Richmond. Take a bill that you don t want to pass and put it onto a subcommittee where you ve stacked it with people who are the most antagonistic to the law.  None of the Republican members agreed to a phone interview for this story but one of them Del. Jason Ballard Giles answered questions by email. Ballard an Army veteran who received 5000 from the NRA in 2021 suggested that existing Virginia law is sufficient writing that the mandates described are unenforceable invasive and run the risk of severe violations of privacy.  Ballard did not directly answer a question about whether the state should revise the existing statute to include older teens who are far more likely to shoot themselves or other people with unsecured guns. He argued that responsible firearm owners also teach their children firearm safety echoing the belief of many adults that children can be educated out of making bad choices with guns an assumption disproved by years of research. Many parents of school shooters ignore glaring warning signs. This grandmother didn t.  As a dad I know that there is no government entity that is more concerned with and dedicated to the safety of my children than I am Ballard continued. I believe that s true of all parents.  An NRA spokesperson made similar assertions emphasizing a need for responsible behavior while opposing legal requirements.  The NRA supports safe storage for every firearm owned in America and we educate gun owners to keep firearms away from unauthorized users spokeswoman Amy Hunter said in a statement. We believe storage should be a personal decision based upon the specific needs of the firearm owner or household versus mandating one specific method for every gun owner.  Critics of the laws contend that they make it harder for people to defend themselves in case of an emergency but many safestorage bills specifically address that issue. State Sen. Jennifer Boysko DFairfax has proposed an amendment that would require owners to lock up their guns and store them separately from the ammunition in homes where someone under 18 might be present. But the proposal includes an exception People would be able to keep loaded guns in safes with biometric locks as long as children could not access them. Highquality pistol safes which can be opened in less than a second with a fingerprint scan are widely available online and cost less than 200.  I come from the Deep South. I have family members who have guns. ... I can understand their concerns Boysko said. This is a very thoughtful carefully crafted commonsense piece of legislation that can save lives.  She is hopeful the bill will pass especially in light of the Newport News shooting. A year ago Rosemary Bayer a state senator in Michigan was even more optimistic that her colleagues would embrace safestorage legislation. On Nov. 30 2021 a 15yearold boy took a 9mm handgun from his home and killed four students at Oxford High in Bayer s district. She and Democratic colleagues had long campaigned for the state to adopt a safestorage law and Bayer felt certain the school shooting would bring consensus.  Surely now you see she recalled telling Republican senators. There was no way they could ignore it.  In session after session Bayer said she stood on the Michigan Senate floor and read stories of other children obtaining guns and shooting people. None of it made a difference even after the county prosecutor Karen McDonald charged the teen s parents with involuntary manslaughter accusing them of unconscionable negligence. Once Bayer said a Republican colleague told her that the gun lobbyists had made it clear to him and to other conservatives that supporting any new regulation would jeopardize their careers.  If you do not toe the line we will primary you with so much money you will never win another election ever again she recalled him telling her. It s just that basic.  Eight hundred miles away in South Carolina where at least four children have committed school shootings in the past two years state Rep. Jermaine L. Johnson D said he has heard a version of the same explanation from Republicans who refused to support similar legislation. Those concerns are not imagined. From South Carolina to Kentucky to Oregon Republicans who showed any sign of softening their support for gunrights activists have paid for it although there have been exceptions. This summer 15 Republicans in the U.S. Senate defied the NRA when they voted to pass a bipartisan gunsafety bill. Two of them Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Sen. Todd C. Young of Indiana were up for reelection last year. Both won easily. In Michigan Bayer has a renewed sense of confidence that the state will finally create a safestorage law this year but not because any Republicans have changed their minds. Her party now controls both chambers of the legislature and the governor s office which means Republicans can no longer bury the bill in a committee and prevent it from reaching the floor of the House or Senate. Every lawmaker she said will be forced to make his or her position known.  They re gonna have a heck of a hard time voting no Bayer said because after Oxford the issue has become deeply personal to voters all over the state just as it now has for many people in Virginia. An EpicMRA poll released in September found that 82 percent of Michigan residents wanted such a law a sentiment held by people from one end of the political spectrum to the the other.
https://news.gallup.com/poll/513623/majority-continues-favor-stricter-gun-laws.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Gallup s latest update on Americans opinions on gun laws finds a majority continuing to favor strengthening those laws. Fiftysix percent of U.S. adults say gun laws should be stricter while 31 believe they should be kept as they are now and 12 favor less strict gun laws. These attitudes collected before last week s mass shooting in Lewiston Maine are unchanged from a year ago but they reflect less support for stricter laws than in June 2022 66 after the Uvalde Texas school shooting. Majorities have consistently favored stricter gun laws since 2015 with notable spikes in that view after prominent shootings such as in Uvalde and Parkland Florida in 2018. Gallup first asked Americans about their preferences for gun laws using the current wording in 1990. Since then majorities have typically called for stricter laws including a high of 78 in the initial September 1990 measurement amid heightened concern about crime and ongoing congressional debate over the Brady Bill handgun legislation which ultimately passed in 1993. The exceptions to majoritylevel support for stricter laws occurred between 2008 and 2014 when between 43 and 49 favored tougher laws with that trend temporarily interrupted by a December 2012 58 reading conducted shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The pattern of increased support for stricter gun laws after prominent shootings suggests that a higher proportion than the 56 measured in the Oct. 223 poll would favor tougher laws if measured today in the wake of the Oct. 25 Lewiston shootings. An Army reservist killed 18 people in shootings at two locations in the Maine town. While Americans do want gun laws tightened they also do not favor a ban on handguns for ordinary citizens something Gallup has asked about since 1959. Just 27 of U.S. adults believe that no one outside of police or other authorized persons should be able to possess a handgun. The current figure is on the lower end of what Gallup has measured historically including 60 who favored a ban in 1959 and roughly four in 10 Americans in most surveys conducted between 1975 and 1993. The low point of 19 favoring a ban came in an October 2021 survey. Opposition to a handgun ban is consistent with Americans belief that having guns makes people s homes safer rather than more dangerous. Currently 64 believe guns make homes safer while 32 believe they make them more dangerous. Public opinion on this issue has shifted over time. When Gallup first asked this version of the question in 2000 a slim majority of 51 believed guns made homes more dangerous places to live. Americans views were evenly divided in 2004 and 2006 but by 2014 the majority had come to believe that guns made homes safer. Opinions have held steady since then. As might be expected the overwhelming majority of those with a gun in their household 86 believe guns make homes safer just 12 disagree. Among those living in households without guns opinion is divided 45 believe they are safer and 49 more dangerous places to live with guns present. Democrats overwhelmingly believe gun laws should be made stricter and believe guns make homes more dangerous. They are also much more likely than Republicans to favor a handgun ban. In contrast Republicans generally want gun laws kept as they are now and believe guns make homes safer. Independents side with Democrats on wanting stricter gun laws but they are closer to Republicans in believing guns increase home safety rather than decrease it. Today s partisan differences on guns contrast with relatively modest gaps two decades ago. Fortyfour percent of U.S. adults say they have a gun in their home or on their property with 30 saying the gun belongs to them personally and the remainder saying it belongs to another household member. These percentages are steady compared with recent years although Gallup measured higher rates of household gun possession between 50 and 53 in the early 1990s. Gun ownership rates have increased among Republicans over the past two decades 45 of Republicans say they personally own a gun and 58 live in a gun household. In 2000 the figures were 32 and 48 respectively. Among independents ownership rates are similar to what they were in 2000 with 29 personally owning a gun and 43 living in a gun household. Democratic gun ownership has declined slightly. Now 18 of Democrats say they personally own a gun and 29 live in a gun household compared with 23 and 36 respectively in 2000. The new poll confirms prior years finding that U.S. gun owners typically have more than one gun. Currently 29 of Americans who have a gun in their household report having one gun while 33 say they have between two and four guns and 22 have five or more. Sixteen percent of respondents from gun households would not disclose how many guns they own. On seven other occasions since 1993 Gallup has asked those with guns to say how many guns their household owns. In each of those surveys majorities of 59 or greater have said their household had multiple guns. But gun owners may now be owning more total guns than in the past. U.S. adults with a gun in their household say their house has an average of 4.9 guns. In prior surveys the average number of guns owned ranged between 4.0 and 4.5. However because of smaller sample sizes of gun owners in each survey and a large variation in the reported number of guns the current estimate is not significantly higher than past measures from a statistical perspective. The gun issue has played a major role in U.S. political debate in recent years and each mass shooting such as the one that occurred in Maine last week returns the issue to the forefront. Though the two major U.S. political parties are increasingly divided on the issue Americans as a whole have been largely consistent in wanting gun laws to be stricter but also opposing a handgun ban. Their views on whether guns make homes safer or more dangerous have shifted with a solid majority now believing guns make homes safer. Last year in response to the Uvalde shooting Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation designed to address gun violence which was hailed as the first major federal legislation on the issue in decades. The legislation expanded background checks on gun purchases for young adults increased mental health funding expanded prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence and created incentives for states to pass red flag laws. However Americans apparently did not see those steps as going far enough to prevent gun violence with no decrease since the law was signed in the percentage wanting laws to be tougher. That could reflect that Americans favor a number of proposals that have been offered as antidotes to gun violence including longer waiting periods for gun purchases and an assault weapons ban that were not included in the legislation.
