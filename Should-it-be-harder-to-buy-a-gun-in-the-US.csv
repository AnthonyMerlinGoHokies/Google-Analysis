Hanah Goetz Evergreen columnistopinion editorMarch 7 2018 I am an owner of an AR15. Despite this I am willing to give up my rifle if it means protecting the lives of others. I was a competition shooter for High Power for 10 years and my competition gun was an AR15. I was even trained by the Marine Corps shooting team for a good majority of my shooting career. I won regional state and national titles with my gun. It was my careermaker the sport that defined me for 10 years of my life before an injury ended it. I always saw my rifle as a piece of equipment for my sport and while I was competing the gun crisis was just starting to grow into what it is today. My rifle has memories of my sport s history. I love it like a NASCAR driver loves their car it s a tool of the sport that you bond and connect with. You practice with it you get to know its inner workings and you understand the power behind it. I sit every day in this moral dilemma An item I made my name with is now being used for mass killings. I love my sport yet I own one of the most politicallycharged items in history. After all these deaths when the idea of arming the good guy or teachers to ensure students are protected comes up I find the argument lacking logic. We re looking at responding to the issue but we aren t looking at the actual cause of it. While the mental health crisis is one cause another is the ability for the inexperienced user to get a hold of these weapons. When my career as a marksman ended I found myself selling guns in a sports shop department specialized in hunting and fishing. I worked under managers who had no personal training with guns. I ve seen stoners walk out with shotguns people who had no idea how to handle them buy highpowered rifles and idiot 18yearolds come and buy their first gun just because they could with no training behind them and no desire to obtain it. My managers just wanted the sales they didn t care who bought the guns. And due to the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act which prevented sellers and manufacturers from being sued if the guns were involved in illegal action whoever was buying the guns was the least of their worries. Buddy Levy an English professor and avid bird hunter who grew up around shotguns believes there should still be some type of restrictions.  Adding more guns to a national gun crisis is a bad idea Levy said. When you have more people with guns you re adding to the probability that something bad is going to happen.  Japan is known for its low crime rates associated with guns. According to The Guardian in Japan before they can even lay hands on a gun prospective owners must attend classes and pass written and practical exams. They must then undergo psychological assessments to determine they are fit to own a firearm. Police background checks are exhaustive and even extend to the gun owners relatives.  When our parents were growing up marksmanship competitions like what I was in were a communal sport that invited the idea of learning and getting comfortable with the guns often with the intent of freshening up skills for the next hunting season. I ve seen firsthand how the sport and activity have become politicallycharged with venom and destruction in its wake. It s no longer anything sportsmanlike or communal there is hardly any teaching of how to respect the weapon involved. It has become all about gaining points for masculinity. It s currently a thundering of political ideals that override logic. This is caused in part by the NRA. Though my Expert Marksman certification was issued from this organization the NRA is leading the cause for reasons that are less focused on the community and more focused on their wallets and political standing. They generously abuse the instinctual nature of masculinity and territory protection to ensure they gain support while behind the scenes attempting to control the information that would hurt their stance. According to The Christian Science Monitor the NRA has effectively blocked the federal Centers for Disease Control from studying the effects of gun violence.  Meanwhile they make guns part of an individual s identity. It gave me a part of mine it is the first fact people remember about me most of the time. Everyone deserves to own a gun the NRA argues as their members accumulate a mass collection of rifles and pistols. Untrained individuals purchase combatready shotguns for home defense that will likely languish in a closet unused for the span of their lifetime. They weren t raised in a hunting family like I was where respect for guns was taught early. They weren t raised knowing any purpose to the weapon that involved feeding your family or being used in a sport like mine. After a while the scarier situations outweighed those that involved people who had actual knowledge of the guns. This is not how it should be. Odds are if any type of gun control law does pass I will still keep my gun. There aren t enough resources for anyone to go in and take them physically away from those who already own them. However adding a level of difficulty to obtaining these weapons is one step toward making our lives a bit safer. We don t have to completely eliminate them but we should at least make sure they re sold to the people who know what they re doing and are mentally stable. Stronger background checks are one way we can do this along with proof of training to at least make sure people know what they re doing. Psychological assessments like what is found in Japan would be the most ideal considering that the mental health crisis is a key factor to most mass shootings. If we re tighter with our regulations to ensure that guns get in to the right hands if at all then we can create a bit more safety. We won t have the capacity to eliminate guns all together and that s not the point. We just need to be smarter about how they are handled. If we are to find a compromise on this major issue this is where it will be. Hanah Goetz is a senior creative writing major from Kenosha WI. She can be contacted at 3352290 or by email protected.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/doesn-t-make-sense-how-easy-it-buy-gun-n490756, A main tenet of his plan involves requiring anyone who sells a gun to obtain a license which would then mean they would have to perform background checks on any potential gun buyer. The measure is designed in part to keep guns from being sold without background checks at gun shows privately and online in what is often referred to as the gun law loophole. Obama announced that regulators would crack down on dealers who use these loopholes to avoid acquiring licenses thereby skirting the requirement to perform background checks.  We ve created a system in which dangerous people are allowed to play by a different set of rules Obama said Tuesday. That doesn t make sense.  In the U.S. there are more than 55000 licensed gun dealers according to a 2015 Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives report. That includes everything from small privatelyowned gun shops and sporting goods stores to big chain stores that carry guns like WalMart. Additionally there are more than 8000 pawn shops that are licensed to sell guns according to the ATF. Both licensed gun dealers and pawn shops are required by federal law to conduct background checks when selling guns. But not every gunbuyer goes the gun store route and in a majority of states gun sellers that aren t licensed aren t required to perform a background check according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Only 13 states require a background check to be performed no matter how a gun is sold or what kind of gun it is according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. In most states guns can be sold between private parties like friends or acquaintances but commonly these backgroundcheckfree gun sales occur are at gun shows. Since 1994 background checks have prohibited more than 2.4 million gun purchases but 40 percent of guns sold in the U.S. are still sold with no questions asked according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. According to the U.S. Department of Justice large numbers of firearms are sold anonymously at more than 4000 gun shows each year. That averages to about 11 gun shows on any given day. Related Obama Announcement Puts Gun Control at Center of 2016 Campaign Guns can also be advertised online but according to federal law the actual sale of the firearm must happen at a licensed brickandmortar store where it would be required to perform a background check as usual. Obama said Tuesday that some gun sellers have been operating on the Internet without conducting background checks and that a study of one such site showed one in 30 people looking to buy a gun there had a criminal record. A system implemented in 1998 called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS amended 1991 s Brady Act which originally mandated licensed gun sellers to conduct a background check which came with a fiveday waiting period. But NICS as indicated by its name is designed to be instantaneous. In 2014 NICS achieved a 91 percent immediate determination rate according to the FBI. The other 9 percent are cases in which the FBI needs more time to check out the potential buyer. If the process which usually includes contacting local authorities can t be completed in three business days the licensed dealer can still sell the gun with an incomplete background check. Related Mistakes in Dylann Roofs Background Check Fuel Gun Law Debate Nine types of people can be disqualified by a background check including felons fugitives undocumented immigrants drug addicts and people committed to mental institutions according to the U.S. Department of Justice. Licensed dealers are also prohibited from selling handguns to people under the age of 21 and rifles and shotguns to people under the age of 18 according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Unlicensed sellers can t sell handguns to anyone under the age of 18 but can sell deliver or otherwise transfer a long gun or long gun a rifle or shotgun ammunition to a person of any age according to the Law Center. Federal law does not require gun owners or purchasers to get a license but 14 states mandate licensing to own all types or some types of guns according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Federal law also doesn t restrict the open carrying of firearms in public and 31 states allow the open carrying of a handgun without any license or permit the Law Center reports. At some retailers including the chain Bass Pro Shops and some mom and pop gun stores a customer can walk out with a rifle for just over 100 or a handgun for as little as 200.

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/08/16/for-most-u-s-gun-owners-protection-is-the-main-reason-they-own-a-gun/, Here are the questions used for the report and its methodology. Gun owners in the United States continue to cite protection far more than other factors including hunting and sport shooting as a major reason they own a gun. And while a sizable majority of gun owners 71 say they enjoy having a gun an even larger share 81 say they feel safer owning a gun. A Pew Research Center survey conducted June 511 among 5115 members of the Center s nationally representative American Trends Panel finds 72 of U.S. gun owners say protection is a major reason they own a gun. That far surpasses the shares of gun owners who cite other reasons. This view has changed only modestly since the Center s major survey of attitudes toward gun ownership and gun policies in 2017. At that time 67 of gun owners cited protection as a major reason they owned a firearm. The demographics of gun ownership have changed little in recent years. Gun ownership is far more common among residents of rural areas 47 than among people living in suburbs 30 or urban areas 20. Republicans and Republicanleaning independents 45 are far more likely than Democrats and Democratic leaners 20 to report owning a gun. Few gun owners worry about having a gun in their home. Just 12 of gun owners say they worry about having guns in their home 88 say they do not. Sizable majorities say owning a gun makes them feel safer and gives them a feeling of enjoyment. How nongun owners feel about possibly owning a gun. About half of Americans who don t own a gun say they could never see themselves owning one 52 while nearly as many could imagine themselves as gun owners in the future 47. These views are little changed from 2017. Men who do not own a gun are far more likely than women nonowners to say they could see themselves owning a gun in the future 56 vs. 40. While a larger share of Republicans than Democrats say they own a gun Republican nonowners also are more likely than Democratic nonowners to say they would consider owning a gun in the future 61 vs. 40. A narrow majority of Black nonowners 56 say they could see themselves owning a gun in the future compared with smaller shares of White 48 Hispanic 40 and Asian nonowners 38. A majority of Americans 61 say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun in this country while 30 say the ease of legally obtaining a gun is about right 9 say it is too hard. A Center report released in June found that 58 say gun laws should be stricter than they are today 26 think they are about right while 15 favor less strict gun laws. There are demographic and partisan differences in opinions about whether it is too easy to legally obtain a gun Majorities of U.S. adults living in urban 72 and suburban 63 communities say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun. Opinion among rural residents is more divided 47 say it is too easy 41 say it is about right and 11 say it is too hard. Nonowners are nearly twice as likely as gun owners to say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun 73 vs. 38. The partisan divide in opinions about the ease of legally obtaining guns in the U.S. is wider than the difference in views between gun owners and nonowners. An overwhelming share of Democrats 86 say it is too easy to obtain a gun legally. About a third of Republicans 34 say the same. The shares of adults who say they personally own a gun or that someone else in their household owns a gun has changed little in recent years. Roughly a third 32 say they own a gun another 10 say that while they do not personally own a gun someone else in their household does. Fourinten men say they own a gun compared with a quarter of women. And White adults are far more likely than Black Hispanic or Asian adults to say they personally own a gun. Reported gun ownership is much higher among adults living in rural areas 47 than suburban 30 or urban residents 20. Republicans particularly conservative Republicans are far more likely than Democrats to say they own a gun. About half of conservative Republicans 51 say they own a gun. That compares with 38 of moderate and liberal Republicans 24 of conservative and moderate Democrats and 16 of liberal Democrats. Gun owners express overwhelmingly positive sentiments about owning a gun with sizable majorities saying it makes them feel safer and that they enjoy having a gun. However people who do not own guns but live in households in which there is a gun present are far less likely to voice positive sentiments. While 81 of gun owners say owning a gun makes them feel safer a smaller majority of nonowners in gun households 57 say the same about the presence of a gun in the home. About threeinten nonowners in gun households 31 enjoy having a gun in the house that compares with 71 of gun owners who say they enjoy owning a gun. And a larger share of nonowners 27 than owners 12 worry about having a gun in the home. There also are partisan differences among gun owners in their opinions about owning a gun. Republican gun owners are more likely than Democratic gun owners to say owning a gun gives them feelings of safety and enjoyment while Democratic gun owners are more likely to say they worry about having a gun in the home. Measuring gun ownership in the United States comes with a unique set of challenges. Unlike many demographic measures there is not a definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many American adults own guns. This survey conducted June 511 2023 on Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel asks about gun ownership using two separate questions to measure personal and household ownership. About a third of adults 32 say they own a gun while another 10 say they do not personally own a gun but someone else in their household does. These shares are little changed from surveys conducted in 2021 and 2017. In each of those surveys 30 reported they owned a gun. These numbers are largely consistent with rates of gun ownership reported by Gallup but somewhat higher than those reported by the General Social Survey. Those surveys also find only modest changes in recent years. The FBI maintains data on background checks on individuals attempting to purchase firearms in the United States. The FBI reported a surge in background checks in 2020 and 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of federal background checks declined in 2022 and through the first half of this year according to FBI statistics.

https://www.economist.com/leaders/2022/05/25/why-america-should-make-it-harder-to-buy-guns, The motives for mass murder vary. The teenager in Buffalo who on May 14th shot and killed ten people most of them black was driven by racial paranoia. The 68yearold who killed one and injured five on May 16th in a Californian church hated Taiwanese people. What impelled Salvador Ramos to kill at least 21 on May 24th in and around a school in Texas may someday become apparent though Mr Ramos is no longer alive to explain himself. What these horrors have in common though is the murder weapon. Guns are simple reliable tools for killing. A man with a gun and plenty of ammunition can kill more people more quickly and with far less physical effort than he can with a knife a blunt object or his bare hands. The weapon Mr Ramos used a militarystyle assault rifle with highcapacity magazines allowed him to keep shooting until someone shot him. That most of his victims were children makes the crime unusually horrific. But it resembles countless other American tragedies in that the easy availability of guns made it deadlier than it might have been. A robber who carries a gun is more likely to kill. Domestic quarrels are more likely to end in death if a firearm is handy. Suicide attempts with guns usually succeed. Police in England and Wales shot and killed only two people in 2021 American cops killed 1055. The main reason for this vast disparity is not that English cops are gentler or less racist. It is that American police face a heatpacking public. Most of those they kill are armed many of the rest are mistakenly believed to be so. The abundance of guns is also the main reason why the murder rate in America is four or five times higher than in a typical rich country. By one estimate Americans own 400m guns. If they were evenly distributed each family of five would have six. In 2020 more than 45000 people in America died from firearmrelated injuries. Guns now kill more young people than cars do. The Economist believes it should be hard to own a gun. Farmers need them for pest control hunters and other hobbyists may use them for sport. But each gun should be licensed and registered. Each owner should have to pass stringent background checks and the process should be slow no one should be able to buy a gun while in a fit of rage. Also there is no good reason to let civilians own guns that fire rapidly or magazines that let them kill a room full of people before reloading.  In America such strict gun control is unthinkable. The Second Amendment guarantees a right to bear arms and the National Rifle Association promotes a maximalist interpretation of it. Politicians who hint that they might make it a little bit harder to obtain a firearm face a wellorganised bloc of singleissue voters. In Republican primaries especially few dare offend the gun lobby. Hence the steady loosening of rules in places like Texas where 21yearolds can carry a handgun in public without training or a permit both of which are needed to cut hair and where 18yearolds can buy a handgun if they come from a violent home to defend themselves against abusive relatives and where almost any adult can buy a rifle with minimal hassle. Mr Ramos bought two assault rifles legally as soon as he turned 18 and shot his grandmother before heading for the local elementary school. This is not what most Americans want. Hefty but dwindling majorities favour some commonsense curbs such as denying weapons to the mentally ill creating a database to track all gun sales and banning both assaultstyle weapons and highcapacity magazines. Congress is unlikely to deliver such things thanks to the Senate filibuster. So cities and states should step in though guns will always flow illicitly from lax jurisdictions to stringent ones. Voters should reward politicians who think a gun licence should be at least as hard to obtain as a driving licence. Not all gun deaths are preventable but many could be.

Gun rights activists in Texas where it s legal to carry guns openly in most public places Last month a gunman opened fire in the baggage claim of the airport in Fort Lauderdale Florida. The shooter was later identified as an Army veteran who had sought help for mental illness. He killed five people. The deadly shooting reignited a longstanding debate about firearms in the United States. The U.S. has more guns and gun deaths than any other developed country.  As firearms have become more powerful and mass shootings fill the news arguments over gun laws have grown more heated. Some people say that we need stricter laws to limit the kinds of guns that are legal to own and make it harder for criminals to get weapons. These kinds of restrictions are known as gun control.  Opponents of such measures say that most guncontrol laws violate the right to bear arms that the Framers laid out in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that this amendment protects a person s right to keep a loaded firearm for selfdefense.  Congress hasn t passed major guncontrol legislation in two decades. President Donald Trump has said he would oppose any new guncontrol measures. He favors expanding gun owners rights. Does the U.S. need tougher guncontrol laws? Two experts weigh in. We lose more than 36000 Americans to gun violence every year in this country. That s an average of 99 gun deaths a day. These tragedies range from accidents and suicides to horrific mass shootings like the one at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando Florida last June.  No other democracy in the world experiences this level of gun violence. That s because other free nations have tough gun laws to deal with this problem.  It s estimated that Americans own more than 300 million guns. Guns certainly do not cause crime but the fact that they are so easily available does make crimes more deadly. Simply put when more people have guns the odds go up that those guns will be used.  We lose more than 36000 Americans to gun violence every year. We re all tired of reading stories about shooters who passed background checks and legally purchased firearms despite histories of violent behavior severe mental illness and substance abuse. And that s when background checks are required. A new survey found that 22 percent of gun owners recently bought a firearm through a private sale. Such sales do not require a background check and are legal in more than 30 states. That gives dangerous people a free pass to arm themselves. We need tougher gun laws across the board but a logical place to start is with the enactment of a federal law requiring background checks on all gun sales. Those checks should also be strengthened to block all those with a history of violence.  The United States is known for accomplishing extraordinary things. Never let anyone tell you that we can t save the lives we re losing to gun violence. We can and we must.  Ladd EverittDirector One Pulse for America a gun violence prevention group On July 24 2014 a doctor used his concealed handgun to disable a gunman who had begun firing in a hospital in Darby Pennsylvania. One hospital worker had been killed. Police said that if the doctor had not been armed many more innocent people would have died.  As for the gunman not only did he ignore the hospital s no weapons policy he had both a mental and a criminal record that disqualified him from possessing firearms under federal law.  And that is precisely the problem Gun control has consistently failed to keep bad guys from getting firearms. Guncontrol advocates claim that we just need tougher laws. But with thousands of pages of failed gun laws already on the books it s highly unrealistic to think that enacting more restrictions will work any better.  People are using guns to save a life more often than to take a life. In 2003 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC examined dozens of gun and ammunition bans waiting periods and background checks. After analyzing all these restrictions the CDC concluded that the evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of any of these guncontrol laws.  The CDC examined the issue again in 2013 and reported that there are between 500000 and  3 million annual cases of guns being used for selfdefense. This means that people are using guns to save a life 16 to 100 times more often than to take a life. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled on the right to keep and bear arms which is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. The Court correctly noted that this right belongs to all Americans. We should reject additional restrictions on this important right.  Erich PrattExecutive Director Gun Owners of America CORE QUESTION What evidence does each writer use to support his claim?

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/, The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms and about a third of U.S. adults say they personally own a gun. At the same time in response to concerns such as rising gun death rates and mass shootings President Joe Biden has proposed gun policy legislation that would expand on the bipartisan gun safety bill Congress passed last year. Here are some key findings about Americans views of gun ownership gun policy and other subjects drawn primarily from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June 2023. Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to summarize key facts about Americans and guns. We used data from recent Center surveys to provide insights into Americans views on gun policy and how those views have changed over time as well as to examine the proportion of adults who own guns and their reasons for doing so. The analysis draws primarily from a survey of 5115 U.S. adults conducted from June 5 to June 11 2023. Everyone who took part in the surveys cited is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for the analysis on gun ownership the questions used for the analysis on gun policy and the survey s methodology. Additional information about the fall 2022 survey of parents and its methodology can be found at the link in the text of this post. Measuring gun ownership in the United States comes with unique challenges. Unlike many demographic measures there is not a definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many American adults own guns. The Pew Research Center survey conducted June 511 2023 on the Center s American Trends Panel asks about gun ownership using two separate questions to measure personal and household ownership. About a third of adults 32 say they own a gun while another 10 say they do not personally own a gun but someone else in their household does. These shares have changed little from surveys conducted in 2021 and 2017. In each of those surveys 30 reported they owned a gun. These numbers are largely consistent with rates of gun ownership reported by Gallup but somewhat higher than those reported by NORC s General Social Survey. Those surveys also find only modest changes in recent years. The FBI maintains data on background checks on individuals attempting to purchase firearms in the United States. The FBI reported a surge in background checks in 2020 and 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of federal background checks declined in 2022 and through the first half of this year according to FBI statistics. About fourinten U.S. adults say they live in a household with a gun including 32 who say they personally own one according to an August report based on our June survey. These numbers are virtually unchanged since the last time we asked this question in 2021. There are differences in gun ownership rates by political affiliation gender community type and other factors. Personal protection tops the list of reasons gun owners give for owning a firearm. About threequarters 72 of gun owners say that protection is a major reason they own a gun. Considerably smaller shares say that a major reason they own a gun is for hunting 32 for sport shooting 30 as part of a gun collection 15 or for their job 7.  The reasons behind gun ownership have changed only modestly since our 2017 survey of attitudes toward gun ownership and gun policies. At that time 67 of gun owners cited protection as a major reason they owned a firearm. Gun owners tend to have much more positive feelings about having a gun in the house than nonowners who live with them. For instance 71 of gun owners say they enjoy owning a gun but far fewer nongun owners in gunowning households 31 say they enjoy having one in the home. And while 81 of gun owners say owning a gun makes them feel safer a narrower majority 57 of nonowners in gun households say the same about having a firearm at home. Nonowners are also more likely than owners to worry about having a gun in the home 27 vs. 12 respectively. Feelings about gun ownership also differ by political affiliation even among those who personally own firearms. Republican gun owners are more likely than Democratic owners to say owning a gun gives them feelings of safety and enjoyment while Democratic owners are more likely to say they worry about having a gun in the home. Nongun owners are split on whether they see themselves owning a firearm in the future. About half 52 of Americans who don t own a gun say they could never see themselves owning one while nearly as many 47 could imagine themselves as gun owners in the future. Americans are evenly split over whether gun ownership does more to increase or decrease safety. About half 49 say it does more to increase safety by allowing lawabiding citizens to protect themselves but an equal share say gun ownership does more to reduce safety by giving too many people access to firearms and increasing misuse. Republicans and Democrats differ on this question 79 of Republicans say that gun ownership does more to increase safety while a nearly identical share of Democrats 78 say that it does more to reduce safety. Urban and rural Americans also have starkly different views. Among adults who live in urban areas 64 say gun ownership reduces safety while 34 say it does more to increase safety. Among those who live in rural areas 65 say gun ownership increases safety compared with 33 who say it does more to reduce safety. Those living in the suburbs are about evenly split. Americans increasingly say that gun violence is a major problem. Sixinten U.S. adults say gun violence is a very big problem in the country today up 9 percentage points from spring 2022. In the survey conducted this June 23 say gun violence is a moderately big problem and about twointen say it is either a small problem 13 or not a problem at all 4. Looking ahead 62 of Americans say they expect the level of gun violence to increase over the next five years. This is double the share who expect it to stay the same 31. Just 7 expect the level of gun violence to decrease. A majority of Americans 61 say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun in this country. Another 30 say the ease of legally obtaining a gun is about right and 9 say it is too hard to get a gun. Nongun owners are nearly twice as likely as gun owners to say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun 73 vs. 38. Meanwhile gun owners are more than twice as likely as nonowners to say the ease of obtaining a gun is about right 48 vs. 20. Partisan and demographic differences also exist on this question. While 86 of Democrats say it is too easy to obtain a gun legally 34 of Republicans say the same. Most urban 72 and suburban 63 dwellers say it s too easy to legally obtain a gun. Rural residents are more divided 47 say it is too easy 41 say it is about right and 11 say it is too hard. About sixinten U.S. adults 58 favor stricter gun laws. Another 26 say that U.S. gun laws are about right and 15 favor less strict gun laws. The percentage who say these laws should be stricter has fluctuated a bit in recent years. In 2021 53 favored stricter gun laws and in 2019 60 said laws should be stricter. About a third 32 of parents with K12 students say they are very or extremely worried about a shooting ever happening at their children s school according to a fall 2022 Center survey of parents with at least one child younger than 18. A similar share of K12 parents 31 say they are not too or not at all worried about a shooting ever happening at their children s school while 37 of parents say they are somewhat worried. Among all parents with children under 18 including those who are not in school 63 see improving mental health screening and treatment as a very or extremely effective way to prevent school shootings. This is larger than the shares who say the same about having police officers or armed security in schools 49 banning assaultstyle weapons 45 or having metal detectors in schools 41. Just 24 of parents say allowing teachers and school administrators to carry guns in school would be a very or extremely effective approach while half say this would be not too or not at all effective. There is broad partisan agreement on some gun policy proposals but most are politically divisive the June 2023 survey found. Majorities of U.S. adults in both partisan coalitions somewhat or strongly favor two policies that would restrict gun access preventing those with mental illnesses from purchasing guns 88 of Republicans and 89 of Democrats support this and increasing the minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old 69 of Republicans 90 of Democrats. Majorities in both parties also oppose allowing people to carry concealed firearms without a permit 60 of Republicans and 91 of Democrats oppose this. Republicans and Democrats differ on several other proposals. While 85 of Democrats favor banning both assaultstyle weapons and highcapacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds majorities of Republicans oppose these proposals 57 and 54 respectively. Most Republicans on the other hand support allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K12 schools 74 and allowing people to carry concealed guns in more places 71. These proposals are supported by just 27 and 19 of Democrats respectively. Gun ownership is linked with views on gun policies. Americans who own guns are less likely than nonowners to favor restrictions on gun ownership with a notable exception. Nearly identical majorities of gun owners 87 and nonowners 89 favor preventing mentally ill people from buying guns. Within both parties differences between gun owners and nonowners are evident but they are especially stark among Republicans. For example majorities of Republicans who do not own guns support banning highcapacity ammunition magazines and assaultstyle weapons compared with about threeinten Republican gun owners. Among Democrats majorities of both gun owners and nonowners favor these two proposals though support is greater among nonowners.  Note This is an update of a post originally published on Jan. 5 2016.
