https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/future-college-admissions-without-affirmative-action, The US Supreme Court s upcoming affirmative action decision which many legal experts expect will limit or end the consideration of an applicant s race in college admissions would likely immediately hinder college and universities ability to maintain let alone increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their student bodies. Research on schools in states that have eliminated affirmative action suggests no other single admissions policy will produce current levels of racial and ethnic diversity on its own. What admissions policies have been enacted in states where affirmative action has already been banned? And what effect have those policies had on student racial diversity? In states that have eliminated affirmative action studies have consistently found declines in the admission and enrollment of Black Latinx and Indigenous people. These declines are especially concentrated in selective and flagship institutions. Evidence shows diversity in higher education improves learning outcomes for all students and the benefits extend beyond graduation. A ban could not only negatively affect students of color who would be less likely to attend selective institutions that usually have more resources and higher graduation rates but could also prevent other students at these universities from benefiting from the perspectives and experiences that having a more diverse class brings. Simulations that measure the consequences of banning affirmative action and the effectiveness of raceneutral policies find that although alternatives may mitigate the effects of the ban they will not fully make up for the loss of racial diversity on their own. However if the use of race is prohibited in college admissions the following approaches would likely be most adopted. A frequently discussed raceneutral admissions policy is a classbased admissions practice. Under this approach greater weight is given to applicants from less affluent socioeconomic backgrounds to recognize those students may not have had the same resources and educational opportunities as wealthier students. Black and Latinx households have disproportionally lower incomes because of structural barriers so applying a greater weight to an applicant s income status theoretically could produce a more racially diverse cohort of students.Multiple statistical models of this approach found absent other changes to the current admissions process classbased admissions on its own would not provide similar levels of diversity as racebased admissions. In its amicus brief the University of Michigan went a step further saying classbased admissions don t increase racial diversity and using it as the sole means to increase nonwhite enrollment can exacerbate stereotypes rather than alleviating them. PDFBecause there are more white people with low incomes than racially underrepresented people with low incomes and because people of color with low incomes also face systemic racism that further disadvantages them in the education system classbased affirmative action would likely not lead to racial diversity at the same levels as racebased affirmative action. After affirmative action was banned in California Texas and Florida each state implemented percentage plans PDF under which a certain percentage of the top students from a high school s graduating class would receive automatic admission to state universities. Texas s percentage plan developed by a special task force of the state legislature was adopted to combat the effects of the Hopwood ruling on diversity PDF. The idea was that by admitting students from various high schools around the state the state s universities would be more representative of Texas s population leading to greater diversity.Although these policies helped increase diversity at some schools they were less effective than racebased admissions policies in increasing Black and Latinx student enrollment because of Black and Latinx underrepresentation in the top percentages of high school classes and the fact that many of the racially underrepresented students at the top of their classes likely would have been admitted without the automatic admission plan.Additionally in Texas studies show that rebounds in the amount of racially or ethnically underrepresented students at state universities after the elimination of affirmative action are more attributable to the large increases of Latinx and Black people in the overall population than the state s top percentage plan. Data show application rates of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to selective institutions are not representative of their state s demographic composition. These students of color with similar qualifications as white students are also less likely to apply to moreselective schools even when eligible for automatic admission.Increased recruitment in areas with greater racial diversity can help inform prospective students about the application process and encourage them to apply but may not offset declines that occurred after affirmative action bans alone.For example Texas A M and the University of Texas at Austin created partnership programs with underrepresented schools to recruit and provide financial aid and support to a select number of students. But even with this program and automated admission those eligible for the scholarships and the top percentage plan were still less likely to enroll in these more selective universities relative to other high school students. The systemic exclusion of students of color from higher education means white students benefit most from legacy preferences in admissions. Many highly selective schools admit more legacy students than Black and Latinx applicants and the rate of admission for legacies is more than three times higher than for nonlegacy applicants.Ending legacy admissions could help make the higher education admission process more equitable. When Johns Hopkins University eliminated legacy preferences in 2014 the percentage of firstgeneration students increased by approximately 10 percent and the percentage of Pelleligible students increased by about 7 percent between 2013 and 2021. Though standardized tests for college admission are often found to benefit wealthy white students most research on the role of testoptional policies in increasing the racial diversity of applicants is inconclusive. However a study on the institutions that adopted the policy found the percentage of Black Latinx and Indigenous students and the percentage of Pelleligible students increased slightly at testoptional institutions compared with similar schools that still required SAT or ACT scores. Making tests optional or eliminating them could help selective institutions remove one barrier to students of color applying and being admitted. Research suggests colleges and universities particularly selective ones would experience a decrease in racial and ethnic diversity among their students if the Supreme Court ends racebased affirmative action because no single raceneutral admission policy has the same effect as raceconscious admissions. If overturned returning to current diversity levels would require a commitment to adopting a combination of the strategies above innovating these strategies or developing new ones. In the meantime better national data on the admissions process will be critical to understanding the effectiveness of raceneutral policies.

https://www.theguardian.com/law/2023/jun/22/what-is-affirmative-action-supreme-court-explainer, The US supreme court has banned the use of affirmativeaction policies that have been in place for decades Envisioned as a tool to help remedy historical discrimination and create more diverse student bodies affirmative action policies have permitted hundreds of colleges and universities to factor in students racial backgrounds during the admissions process. That consideration is supplementary and taken in tandem with other factors such as applicants test scores grades and extracurricular activities. Even with raceconscious admissions however many selective public and private colleges and universities struggle to enroll diverse student populations that accurately reflect society. At the University of North Carolina for example in a state where 21 of people are Black just 8 of the school s undergraduates are Black. Opponents of affirmative action such as the advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions argue that considering race as a factor in the admissions process amounts to racial discrimination particularly against Asian Americans. SFA has brought cases against Harvard University the nation s oldest private university and UNC the nation s first public university to challenge their affirmative action policies which the group contends favors Black and Latino students. Ultimately it hopes that race considerations will be nixed from the admissions process entirely and replaced by raceneutral or colorblind policies. The concept of affirmative action originated in 1961 when President John F Kennedy issued an executive order directing government agencies to ensure that all Americans get an equal opportunity in employment. President Lyndon Johnson took it one step further in 1965 barring public and private organizations that had a federal contract from discriminating based on race color religion and national origin. The prohibition was added to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In 1969 President Richard Nixon s assistant labor secretary Arthur Fletcher who would eventually be known as the father of affirmative action pushed for requiring employers to set goals and timetables to hire more Black workers. That effort known as the Revised Philadelphia Plan would later influence how many schools approached their own raceconscious admissions programs. The practice was challenged when Allan Bakke a white man who was twice denied entry to the medical school at the University of California at Davis sued the university arguing that its policies which included allocating seats for qualified students of color discriminated against him. In 1978 the supreme court narrowly rejected the use of racial quotas but noted that colleges and universities could use race as a factor in the admissions process. Justice Lewis Powell noted that achieving diversity represented a compelling government interest . After generations of near total exclusion of Black students and other students of color colleges and universities began admitting more diverse groups in the 1960s and 70s and soon thereafter incorporated raceconsciousness into their admissions policies. Data shows that the rise of affirmative action policies in higher education has bolstered diversity on college campuses. In 1965 Black students accounted for roughly 5 of all undergraduates. And between 1965 and 2001 the percentage of Black undergraduates doubled. The number of Latino undergraduates also rose during that time. Still the practice of factoring race into the admissions process faced repeated attacks. In 1998 during an era of conservatism California voters approved Proposition 209 which outlawed affirmative action in any state or government agency including its university system. Since then eight more states have eliminated such raceconscious policies. The end of affirmative action at those state levels shows just how impactful the consideration of race in admissions has been a UC Berkeley study found that after the ban in California the number of applicants of color in the UC system sharply shifted away from UC s most selective Berkeley and UCLA campuses causing a cascade of students to enroll at lowerquality public institutions and some private universities . Specifically the number of Black freshmen admitted to UC Berkeley dropped to 3.6 between 2006 and 2010 almost half of its population before the ban. In an amicus brief in the Harvard case attorneys for the University of Michigan which had to stop considering race in admissions in 2006 argued that despite persistent vigorous and varied efforts to achieve diversity it has struggled to do so without raceconsciousness. The number of Black and Native American students has dramatically dropped since the end of affirmative action in the state. Though students of color remain underrepresented at selective colleges and universities today institutions argue that their presence helps shape students oncampus experiences. The removal of race consideration from college admissions could set a precedent for a less diverse school system which stands in stark contrast to an increasingly diverse world.
https://www.brookings.edu/articles/admissions-at-most-colleges-will-be-unaffected-by-supreme-court-ruling-on-affirmative-action/,  econsarahreber Gabriela Goodman and Gabriela Goodman Research Assistant Economic Studies Center for Economic Security and Opportunity Rina Nagashima Rina Nagashima Former Intern Economic Studies Center for Economic Security and Opportunity November 7 2023 Center for Economic Security and Opportunity Since 1978 the law allowed colleges to consider race or ethnicity as one factor in admissions to achieve the educational benefits of diversity. That has changed. In his majority opinion in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard SFFA Chief Justice John Roberts writes that the Harvard and UNC admissions programs cannot be reconciled with the guarantees of the Equal Protection Clause and those colleges must change how they use race and ethnicity to decide who is admitted. Although the Court s opinion does still allow universities to consider an applicant s discussion of how race affects his or her life be it through discrimination inspiration or otherwise most colleges that previously considered race in admissions will likely need to revise their practices to comply with the decision. How many students will be affected by college admissions policy changes in the wake of the decision? The number of colleges that say they have raceconscious admissions has declined in recent decades and older research based on the high school class of 1982 suggests that only the most selective fifth of colleges put significant weight on race in admissions decisions. Further in nine states1 affirmative action in admissions for public colleges was already banned prior to the decision. We report on newly collected data about which colleges say they considered raceethnicity in admissions in recent years. This data confirms earlier findings that show affirmative action was used mostly at a relatively small number of selective universities and thus most college students are enrolled in institutions that did not practice affirmative action prior to the Students for Fair Admissions decision. Declines in Black HispanicLatino and Native American enrollment at highly selective colleges seem likely though that will depend on how institutions interpret the decision and guidance issued by the U.S. Departments of Education and Justice. But the effects will likely be much smaller or nonexistent at the lessselective colleges most students attend. Indeed some of these institutions may see enrollment of Black HispanicLatino and Native students increase as moreselective colleges admit fewer of those students. Colleges that participate in federal financial aid programs are required to report a range of information about their enrollment and admissions practices to the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System IPEDS but this does not include whether they consider race in admissions. Most fouryear colleges participate in the Common Data Set CDS a collaboration of the College Board U.S. News and Peterson s. The survey asks colleges a series of questions about whether various factors are very important important considered or not considered in their admissions decisions. This list includes both academic factors like standardized test scores and high school grades and nonacademic factors including racialethnic status.  U.S. News College Board and Peterson s use the CDS for their rankings U.S. News and their college guides College Board and Peterson s though these organizations appear to no longer post or use the information on consideration of racialethnic status in admissions specifically.2 Many colleges post their full responses to the CDS on their website. We collected and coded colleges responses to the question about whether they consider racialethnic status in admissions from colleges websites3 and merged it to data on enrollment by race and ethnicity and institutional characteristics from IPEDS we also merged to data on Barron s selectivity classification. We describe the data collection and construction in more detail here. Interpreting colleges answers on the CDS is not completely straightforward. While some data colleges provide on the CDS like how many students they enroll could at least in theory be checked against other sources there is no way to know whether a college really considered racialethnic status in admissions or how it was weighted. We cannot use these data to for example predict changes in enrollment under raceblind admissions. The measure we use here is whether a college said they consider racialethnic status in admissions and publicly posted that information albeit as part of a larger data collection. The CDS contains extensive information not only about admissions but also other institutional characteristics. The decision to post the CDS data is most likely not specifically related to the desire to share information about the use or not of affirmative action in admissions. Moreselective colleges are more likely to post the CDS data on their website probably because they are competing for applicants who might wish to consult that information. Discussions about college admissions tend to focus on selective fouryear colleges but many undergraduates attend public twoyear colleges community colleges forprofit colleges or openaccess fouryear colleges which typically have minimal admissions requirements. Because these institutions do not ration access through admissions who is allowed to attend will be largely unaffected by the Court s decision. Such institutions may have other raceconscious programs such as scholarships or targeted recruitment programs that might be affected depending on how they interpret the decision we do not have data on the prevalence of these practices. In the analysis here we focus on firsttime fulltime undergraduates but we note that many college students attend parttime or return to college later in life those students also mostly attend institutions that do not have selective admissions so will not be affected by the Court s decision. Figure 1 shows the distribution of enrollment across institution types for the fall of 2019. Overall a quarter of fulltime firstyear undergraduates attend public twoyear colleges 43 attend openaccess or minimally selective fouryear colleges and 3 attend forprofit institutions the remaining 30 attend fouryear colleges that have selective admissions though even in this category many institutions admit most applicants.4 Students from historically excluded racial and ethnic backgrounds i.e. HispanicLatino Native American and Black students are more likely to attend public twoyear colleges or nonselective fouryear colleges. For example 29 of Black students 34 of HispanicLatino students and 37 of Native American students attend public twoyear colleges. Compared to the other groups white AsianPacific Islander PI and multiracial students are more likely to attend a fouryear institution with selective admissions.  Even without the data on which colleges said they considered race in admissions Figure 1 suggests that a large share of Black HispanicLatino and Native undergraduates attend institutions that will be largely unaffected by the Court s decision since they do not ration access with selective admissions. Our newly collected data shows that more selective institutions were substantially more likely to consider race in admissions consistent with earlier research. Going forward we refer to colleges that indicated they consider racialethnic status in admissions as practicing affirmative action or AA for ease of exposition although as noted above we do not know whether in fact they put weight on race in their decisions or how much. The first panel of Figure 2 shows how AA use varied among fouryear colleges depending on their Barron s selectivity category and weighted by firsttime fulltime enrollment.5 Barron s categorizes colleges based on their admissions rates and the standardized test scores high school grades and class rank of the entering class. The classifications provide a reasonable ranking by selectivity even if there is some arbitrariness to the exact category in which any particular college is placed. Among the most competitive institutions 76 used AA the orange bars but this percentage declines consistently with selectivity. In the three least selective categories which together account for over half of enrollment 8 or less of students attend colleges that used AA.6 The second panel shows the more selective institutions that were most likely to practice AA do not collectively enroll a large share of students. That is in some sense what it means to be selective. The top two groups enroll 21 and the next group enrolls another 20. Institutions in the bottom three categories where AA was rarely used enroll 59 of students.  The share of colleges that do not post their CDS the gray bars also increases as selectivity decreases.7 Below we assign the Not reported colleges to AAuse categories based on their Barron s selectivity category. Among less selective colleges that reported on their use of AA a very small share said they considered race and these colleges are less likely to need to use AA to achieve racial diversity. We assign nonreporting colleges in the bottom three selectivity categories to Probably didn t consider and those above the bottom three categories to Maybe considered.  Over twothirds of fouryear college students attend a public institution and state policies prohibited the consideration of race in admissions at public colleges in nine states even prior to the SFFA decision. In Figure 3 we disaggregate the didn t consider category to show how many colleges didn t consider race because they are public institutions in states that banned the practice. We also assign institutions for which we did not find data to maybe considered or probably didn t consider based on their level of selectivity as described above. The first bar of Figure 3 shows that 22 of fouryear college students attend a college that reported practicing affirmative action 34 attend a college that said they did not consider race in admissions and 17 attend public colleges in states that banned the consideration of raceethnicity in admissions. The remaining 26 attend colleges for which we did not find CDS data 3 of those are selective so might have considered race the light orange and 23 are not very selective and probably did not consider race the light blue. Public colleges were less likely than private colleges to use AA in part but not only because some were banned by law. Among public colleges 18 reported considering race 25 did not consider race and were in ban states and 41 indicated they did not consider race and were not in ban states. Private colleges were more likely than public colleges to say they considered race but also more likely to not post their CDS data at all. Private colleges are also more selective on average compared to public colleges. The gap in AA use between public colleges in nonban states and private colleges is about onethird to half as large within selectivity categories as it is overall. This suggests that in addition to state bans differences in selectivity also explain part of the publicprivate gap in the use of raceconscious admissions.  Majority of historically excluded racialethnic groups attend colleges that did not use AA before SFFAFigure 2 shows that affirmative action was more commonly used by the most selective colleges but those colleges do not enroll a large share of students. In addition students from historically excluded racial and ethnic groups are underrepresented at more selective colleges even though those institutions considered race in admissions. As a result Black HispanicLatino and Native students mostly attend colleges that did not use AA prior to the SFFA decision. This is shown in Figure 4. Only 8 of Native 13 of Black and 14 of HispanicLatino students attend a college that said they practiced affirmative action in admissions.8 Because they are more likely to attend moreselective colleges AsianPI fouryear students are most likely to be enrolled in colleges that considered race in admissions 32 followed by white students 26 and those identifying with two or more races 23.  ConclusionWhile our data on the use of affirmative action prior to the SFFA decision is selfreported by colleges and we do not know how much colleges considered race when they used AA the findings provide a basis for understanding the prevalence of AA within higher education and the potential effects of the Students for Fair Admissions decision. The data shows that a small share most likely less than 15 of fouryear college students from historically excluded racial backgrounds attended colleges that practiced affirmative action prior to the Court s ruling. This is because these students largely do not attend the more selective colleges that were most likely to use affirmative action prior to SFFA. Additionally because many students and disproportionately Black HispanicLatino and Native students attend twoyear institutions the total share of underrepresented groups attending affected institutions is even smaller. More selective and elite colleges receive media attention that is wildly disproportionate to the number of students they educate. To be sure attention to the composition of enrollment at selective colleges is warranted considering they offer high returns for students from disadvantaged backgrounds and their graduates are overrepresented among elites in government business and media. Indeed eight of the nine justices who ruled on the Harvard and UNC cases graduated from law school at Harvard or Yale onethird of Biden s initial cabinet is Harvardeducated and graduates of elite colleges are more likely to have very high earnings or work at a prestigious firm as adults. Importantly we focus on admissions here but the decision has created legal uncertainty about a broad range of programs and practices designed to help people from marginalized racial backgrounds. The effects of the decision on a range of raceconscious practices in higher education scholarship programs outreach campus support programs is unclear. Notably our analysis is limited to undergraduate admissions but graduate and professional schools such as law and medical schools that practiced raceconscious admissions are also affected by the decision so we may see reductions in Black HispanicLatino and Native representation in those programs and professions. These are important trends to watch. Applying to college is complicated and shrouded in mystery especially for students who would be the first in their family to go to college those from historically excluded racial and ethnic groups and those without access to highquality college counseling. Research suggests that the end of affirmative action can lead to a reduction in applications from underrepresented minority students to selective institutions sometimes called a chilling effect. While it is difficult to know how high schoolers from different backgrounds are receiving the current discussion it would be unfortunate if the death of affirmative action reduced college applications from qualified Black HispanicLatino and Native students.

College Board used to include the information about whether colleges consider raceethnicity in admissions along with information about other factors they consider at the Big Future website but that is no longer the case. U.S. New does not appear to have ever included this information in their rankings. After we began collecting the data from colleges website we learned that researchers can request access to the Annual Survey of Colleges which includes the Common Dataset elements from the College Board. Since we already collected much of the data from college websites we chose not to request access through the College Board due to the cost and timeframe involved. In addition although it would be interesting to see how colleges who do not post their CDS answers publicly respond to the questions about consideration of racialethnic status it is not clear how to interpret their responses. The responses can t accurately convey how much weight colleges actually put on racialethnic status in admissions and when they are not public they are also not a public signal of colleges values or intentions. Measuring the selectivity or competitiveness of institutions is difficult. The admit rates reported in IPEDS do not tell the whole story because the number and type of applications an institution receives varies. We rely on Barron s ratings which also take account of the test scores high school grades and class rank of enrolled students to classify colleges by selectivity. We somewhat arbitrarily classify colleges with Barron s ratings of Very Competitive or higher as selective. By this definition the average acceptance rate of fouryear selective colleges is 57 but is as low as 2 the average acceptance rate of fouryear nonselective colleges is 81. There are six main Barron s selectivity categories as well as an additional category that includes specialized schools such as health sciences and music schools. We exclude students attending specialized schools from our analysis and group schools with an open admissions policy and other schools unrated by Barron s with schools in Barron s least selective category. Barron s data are from 2019. Throughout we weight by the number of firsttime fulltime undergraduate students enrolled in the fall of 2019 according to IPEDS. The share of colleges that do not complete and publicly post their CDS data increases as selectivity declines. We were able to find the CDS data accounting for all but 1 of the enrollment in most competitive colleges. How should we interpret the missing data? We think that most of the lesscompetitive colleges that do not post their CDS data did not practice affirmative action. Lessselective institutions often do not need to use affirmative action to achieve racial diversity and among those who did post their data most report that they did not consider racialethnic status. For example in the Competitive category about 10 of students are enrolled at colleges that reported considering race within publicly posted CDS data. In a version of Figure 2 excluding the institutions that did not post their CDS this pattern looks similar but the percentage of colleges using affirmative action is slightly higher. For example among colleges with nonmissing data 77 57 32 and 11 of enrollment in the top four selectivity categories is at colleges that considered race compared to 76 56 27 and 8 respectively. While a small number of institutions did post their CDS but did not answer the question about consideration of raceethnicity the vast majority of missing data arises because we did not find a CDS at all. About 20 of Black firstyear fouryear college students attended Historically Black Colleges and Universities HBCUs. Although they have a longstanding mission of serving the Black community and enroll primarily Black students the HBCUs for which we found CDS data all indicated that they did not consider race in admissions. Many HBCUs however did not post their CDS data at all.

https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/advance-diversity-and-opportunity-higher-education-justice-and-education-departments-release-resources-advance-diversity-and-opportunity-higher-education, U.S. Department of Education Today following the BidenHarris Administration s commitment to advance diversity and opportunity in higher education the U.S. Department of Education s ED Office for Civil Rights and the U.S. Department of Justice s Civil Rights Division are jointly releasing two resources to help colleges and universities understand the U.S. Supreme Court s decision in Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College and Students for Fair Admissions Inc. v. University of North Carolina et al. collectively SFFA . These resources will help colleges and universities as they work to lawfully pursue efforts to achieve a student body that is diverse across a range of factors including race and ethnicity.   For higher education to be an engine for equal opportunity upward mobility and global competitiveness we need campus communities that reflect the beautiful diversity of our country said U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona. The resources issued by the BidenHarris Administration today will provide college leaders with muchneeded clarity on how they can lawfully promote and support diversity and expand access to educational opportunity for all following the Supreme Court s disappointing ruling on affirmative action. This is only the first step and our Administration will continue to work to ensure we prepare students of all backgrounds and income levels to lead our multiracial democracy together.   Ensuring access to higher education for students from different backgrounds is one of the most powerful tools we have to prepare graduates to lead an increasingly diverse nation and make real our country s promise of opportunity for all said Attorney General Merrick B. Garland. These resources provide universities with the information they need to determine what lawful tools remain available to them to promote diversity in higher education. The Justice Department remains committed to working with our partners across government to advance educational opportunity for all Americans regardless of their background.  On June 29 2023 the Supreme Court held in SFFA that the consideration of race in the admissions practices of the University of North Carolina and Harvard College violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 a law that prohibits discrimination based on race color or national origin in programs or activities receiving federal financial assistance including those conducted by colleges and universities. Following the Court s decision in SFFA President Biden and Vice President Harris called on colleges universities and other stakeholders to seize the opportunity to expand access to educational opportunity for all students and to build diverse student bodies including by recognizing and valuing students who have overcome adversity. The Administration remains committed to advancing access to education for all Americans and to promoting diversity in higher education consistent with the law. The Administration has taken swift action to support our Nations colleges and universities so they can continue building pathways to upward mobility and preparing students from all backgrounds to thrive in our workforce. In light of the SFFA decision the Departments today issued a Dear Colleague Letter and a Questions and Answers resource to help colleges and universities understand the Court s decision as they continue to pursue campuses that are racially diverse and that include students with a range of viewpoints talents backgrounds and experiences.   Even after the Court s decision sharply limited a tool that colleges and universities with selective admissions practices have used to create vibrant diverse campus communities colleges and universities may still lawfully work to admit support retain and graduate racially diverse student bodies said Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at ED Catherine E. Lhamon. Today s resources explain practices that remain legally viable and confirms the Federal government s robust civil rights protections in schools.   Educational institutions must ensure that their admissions practices do not create barriers for students based on any protected characteristics including race. We remain firmly committed to equitable educational opportunities for all students and ensuring that students of color are not denied opportunities to participate in the robust exchange of ideas and experiences that are the keystone of college and university life said Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Kristen Clarke. How an applicant s racial identity as well as other aspects of their social identity impact their development goals or educational interests remain important considerations in university admissions.  The Departments Questions Answers resource distills the Court s core holding and offers examples of steps colleges and universities can lawfully take to achieve a student body that is diverse across a range of factors including race and ethnicity such as targeted outreach recruitment and pathway programs evaluation of admission policies and retention strategies and programs.  Last month following the decision ED hosted the National Summit on Equal Opportunity in Higher Education that brought together senior BidenHarris Administration officials student leaders college and university administrators and other stakeholders to discuss innovative strategies that enable colleges and universities to promote educational opportunity. In September ED will produce a report elevating promising practices to build inclusive diverse student bodies including how colleges can give serious consideration to measures of adversity when selecting among qualified applicants. This includes accounting for the financial means of a student or their family where a student grew up and went to high school and personal experiences of hardship or discrimination including racial discrimination in their admissions process. More information on the work the BidenHarris Administration is doing to continue building success for all students to thrive can be found here.

https://www.naicu.edu/policy-advocacy/issue-brief-index/regulation/affirmative-action, In theory federal law permits the limited use of affirmative action in admissions for purposes of promoting diversity in higher education. In practice the federal courts have over the years significantly narrowed the circumstances under which colleges and universities may adopt raceconscious admissions programs. In the wake of the Supreme Court s decision in Students for Fair Admissions v. President and Fellows of Harvard University there remain few if any circumstances in which institutions can legally consider an applicant s race when making an admissions decision. Considerations of race in other educational contexts are likely to face the same fate though alternative avenues for promoting diversity remain available.  Institutions of higher education are deeply committed to maintaining a diverse student background rich in a variety of experiences perspectives and interests. For some institutions affirmative action programs have traditionally been a critical component to achieving this important educational goal. NAICU believes that institutions should be afforded the flexibility to continue to promote diversity on campus if in their academic judgment such diversity is essential to their educational mission and they comply with all legal requirements.  The use of affirmative action in higher education has a long and contentious history. Despite decades of debate and litigation the Supreme Court has in some cases upheld the limited use of race to promote diversity at colleges and universities. Before the Harvard decision the Court s most recent pronouncement on this issue came in 2016 in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin where the Court approved a raceconscious admissions program at the University of Texas at Austin.Generally the constitutionality of governmental policies based on race are evaluated under the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Under judicial precedent laws that contain classifications based on race are subject to strict scrutiny. Such laws will survive strict scrutiny only if they 1 further a compelling governmental interest and 2 are narrowly tailored to meet that interest. Prior to the ruling in the Harvard case the Supreme Court had held that diversity in higher education serves a compelling governmental interest and therefore meets the first prong of this test. However it remained extremely difficult for institutions of higher education to demonstrate that their affirmative action programs were sufficiently narrowly tailored to win judicial approval under the second prong of the test. While this constitutional test is theoretically still in place the Harvard decision effectively gutted the ability of institutions of higher education to meet either prong of this test. Although private colleges and universities are not subject to the same constitutional constraints as public institutions affirmative action programs at private institutions are just as susceptible to legal challenge on statutory grounds. Under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act private colleges and universities that receive federal funding are prohibited from discriminating on the basis of race color or national origin. Because the federal courts have ruled that Title VI forbids the same activities that are prohibited under the Constitution affirmative action programs at private institutions must therefore meet the same constitutional standards that apply to public colleges and universities.  In 2014 the advocacy group Students for Fair Admissions filed several affirmative action suits in federal court. One such suit involves a claim that Harvard s admissions program violates Title VI. According to the complaint in the case Harvard s holistic raceconscious admissions plan allows schools to hide race discrimination against specific groups including Asian Americans. The same group also filed a statutory and constitutional challenge against the University of North Carolina.In 2019 a federal district court upheld Harvard s raceconscious admissions plan. A federal appellate court affirmed the district court s ruling the following year finding that the university s policy was consistent with Supreme Court precedent. The Supreme Court consolidated the Harvard and UNC cases for review and ultimately struck down both programs.Although the decision did not impose an outright ban on raceconscious admissions at colleges and universities the Court s reasoning and application of the relevant constitutional test will likely foreclose direct consideration of race in admissions for the foreseeable future. Specifically the Court held that the Harvard and UNC admissions programs violated the equal protection clause of the Constitution because they lack sufficiently focused and measurable objectives warranting the use of race unavoidably employ race in a negative manner involve racial stereotyping and lack meaningful end points. Given the limitations imposed by the Court s analysis it will remain extremely difficult if not impossible for institutions to craft programs that are sufficiently narrow in scope to pass constitutional muster. Nevertheless the Court s decision did preserve some options for institutions of higher education seeking to promote diversity. In particular the majority opinion left the door open for institutions of higher education to consider an applicant s lived experiences including those referencing race Nothing in this opinion should be construed as prohibiting universities from considering an applicant s discussion of how race affected his or her life be it through discrimination inspiration or otherwise. A benefit to a student who overcame racial discrimination for example must be tied to that student s courage and determination. Or a benefit to a student whose heritage or culture motivated him or her to assume a leadership role or attain a particular goal must be tied to that student s unique ability to contribute to the university. In other words the student must be treated based on his or her experiences as an individual not on the basis of race. Despite the Court s ruling a number of additional options remain available to colleges and universities that are seeking to promote diversity as outlied in guidance frm the Biden Administration described below. In addition to litigation in the courts affirmative action plans at institutions of higher education have long been the subject of various executive branch actions. Under the Obama Administration the Departments of Education and Justice jointly issued multiple guidance documents explaining proactive steps that colleges and universities could voluntarily take to increase diversity at their institutions. The Trump Administration however rescinded those documents and reinstated guidance previously in effect during the Bush Administration that sought to discourage the use of race in admissions.The Trump Administration also took other administrative actions to limit affirmative action programs at institutions of higher education such as Department of Justiceled Title VI investigations into affirmative action programs at elite institutions of higher education.In the wake of the Supreme Court s decision in the Harvard case President Biden criticized the ruling and directed the Department of Education to examine best practices regarding promoting diversity in higher education. The Biden Administration has highlighted some of these options in two separate sets of guidance released after the decision was handed down. The first set of guidance from the Department provides insight into the practices that remain legally permissible on campus. For example colleges and universities can continue to promote diversity by  Subscribe to receive our email Newsletters for the latest news Information.
https://www.epi.org/blog/the-supreme-courts-ban-on-affirmative-action-means-colleges-will-struggle-to-meet-goals-of-diversity-and-equal-opportunity/, After extensive deliberation the Supreme Court has delivered a landmark ruling that effectively prohibits the use of racebased affirmative action in college admissions. Raceblind admissions processes will further exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine the recognition of the unique challenges that Black Hispanic and Native American students encounter throughout the admissions process. By disregarding the significance of race these approaches risk creating a wider divide between equal opportunity and communities of color.  This decision marks a significant setback for colleges which have relied on this tool for over 40 years to enhance racial diversity on their campuses and compensate for decades of both explicit and implicit racebased exclusion. Colleges must now explore options like targeted recruitment programs and using other metrics such as household income and wealth as substitutes for racebased admissions. However flagship schools from states that previously banned affirmative action and used these alternative tactics have a poor track record of success in achieving meaningful diversity gains in their student body without using affirmative action.  Over the years a total of nine states have implemented bans on affirmative action. This policy shift forced top educational institutions like the University of California and the University of Michigan to abandon racebased admissions and find new ways to admit diverse student bodies. As a result these universities made significant efforts to foster racial diversity by investing hundreds of millions of dollars in outreach programs. However according to two amicus briefs in support of affirmative action filed by these two universities last year to the Supreme Court these endeavors have proven to be ineffective. Both university systems revealed perpetually low enrollment rates among students of color despite their significant investment in alternative ways to boost diversity among the applicant pool and student body. Following California s implementation of Proposition 209 in 1996 which banned the use of racial preferences in admissions the state experienced a significant decline in enrollment rates across its educational institutions. Most notable was the decline in Black student enrollment at the University of California Los Angeles UCLA. In 2006 only 96 students less than 2 selfidentified as Black out of a freshman class of nearly 5000 students.  Although enrollment rates have shown some improvement since then disparities in enrollment persist. For example a mere 228 students 3 at the University of California Berkeley identified themselves as Black out of a nearly 7000strong freshman class in the fall of 2022. By comparison the 2021 2022 high school graduating class in California had approximately 8700 Black students that met the requirements for admission into the University of California system. These limited strides in fostering diversity have come at a substantial cost to the University of California system exceeding half a billion dollars in investments since 2004. Likewise at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor enrollment rates for students of color experienced a decline following the state s adoption of Proposal 2 commonly known as the Affirmative Action Initiative in 2006. This voter referendum also led to a state constitutional ban on raceconscious admissions. By 2021 Black enrollment stood at a mere 4 a three percentage point drop from 2006. This is despite the growth of collegeage African Americans in Michigan from 16 to 19. Clearly the University of Michigan has encountered challenges in ensuring that their flagship school reflects the diverse demographics of the state.  The ban on affirmative action has made it more arduous for many universities to achieve proportional representation of underrepresented groups and imposes new constraints in racial equity and equal opportunity in higher education. As an alternative to racebased admissions certain schools and advocates have suggested considering socioeconomic status including wealth as a criterion for preference in college admissions irrespective of race. However this raceblind alternative falls short in capturing the full scope of what racebased admissions could achieve. Focusing solely on socioeconomic status fails to address the specific obstacles that affirmative action was intended to combat.  One significant drawback of this raceblind approach is its potential exclusion of deserving middleclass Black Brown and Native American students. These students may not meet the criteria for preferential treatment based on low socioeconomic status despite facing racial disparities and encountering systemic barriers that hinder their educational opportunities. By overlooking the importance of race this alternative fails to acknowledge the need to uplift marginalized racial and ethnic groups who may not fit neatly into a socioeconomicbased framework. Moreover according to Richard Rothstein author of The Color of Law A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America and the recently released Just Action How to challenge segregation enacted under the color of law when considering wealthbased admissions it is important to acknowledge the significantly larger population of white Americans compared with African Americans. While a higher proportion of the Black population falls into the lowwealth category the potential pool of lowwealth applicants would still consist of a significantly larger number of white students. According to Federal Reserve data from 2019 31 of youths from households in the bottom quarter of the national wealth distribution with a net worth of 12400 or less are Black. Even if preference was given to students in the bottom half of the wealth distribution with a net worth of 121700 or less a smaller proportion of the eligible lowwealth applicants 24 would be Black. Despite the belief that Black people may be overrepresented in a wealthbased program the alternative would still be flawed in capturing many Black students. Classbased admissions based on household income have also been a popular alternative to racebased admissions but similarly to wealth this criteria would fall short of the diversity objectives set by admissions offices and undermine efforts to address discrimination. According to a study by Georgetown University s Center on Education and the Workforce selective colleges that are prohibited from considering race and ethnicity in admissions decisions may regain some level of racial and ethnic diversity by adopting classconscious admissions practices. However the study highlights the considerable difficulties these institutions would encounter in achieving student bodies that accurately reflect the demographic diversity of their state s high school population which typically exhibits higher rates of enrollment across different racial groups compared with universities. The findings suggest that maintaining or surpassing existing representation without raceconscious admissions would necessitate a complete overhaul of the admissions system requiring changes in applicant evaluation and consideration criteria. While socioeconomic status can be a relevant factor in addressing certain forms of disadvantage and college education should absolutely be more accessible to low and middleincome students of all races socioeconomic status alone cannot fully replace the multifaceted impact of racebased admissions.  The pending Supreme Court decision on student loan debt forgiveness adds an additional layer of complexity to using socioeconomic status as a proxy for race in achieving diversity. Student loan debt is yet another barrier hindering students of color from accessing higher education. Without student loan debt forgiveness students of color hailing from lowincome backgrounds encounter even greater disparities in economic outcomes. Irrespective of whether these students gain admission to universities based on their socioeconomic status the intersection of student loan debt structural racism and poverty magnifies the existing gaps in their ability to afford and enroll in higher education institutions. This could impede efforts to achieve a more inclusive and diverse student body based on race and socioeconomic factors.  The complexities of racial discrimination and the need for targeted measures to address historical injustices cannot be adequately captured by a raceblind approach alone. It is crucial to recognize the unique and ongoing struggles faced by underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and continue to advocate for holistic solutions that address both socioeconomic disparities and the significance of race in admissions policies. Affirmative action programs in higher education came into existence specifically to rectify the history of racebased exclusion legally enforced segregation and quota systems that capped the number of nonwhite or other minority students permitted to enroll at colleges and universities across the country. This history of discrimination had everything to do with barring students based on race regardless of their class and led to many of the enrollment disparities we still see today at many institutions. The adoption of raceblind admissions would not provide greater benefits to students of color compared with the existing impact of racebased admissions. Instead any alternative approach would likely harm the enrollment rates of these marginalized groups and prove financially burdensome to implement. It is imperative to recognize the significance of race in addressing systemic inequalities and to prioritize inclusive measures that safeguard access to higher education for underrepresented communities. Universities should persist in advocating for affirmative action specifically for Black Brown and Native American applicants. In an open letter issued a month before the Court s ruling the presidents of 27 liberal arts colleges stated To fulfill the promise of economic and social mobility we need to continue rectifying the systemic barriers that have kept so many talented students of color out of higher education. Rothstein argues that university presidents defending affirmative action programs on the grounds of rectifying past injustices could sway lowercourt judges and dissenting justices to support affirmative action as a valid remedy. This approach may also pave the way for future Supreme Court justices to reject raceblind ideologies that currently impede reform efforts. Ultimately maintaining intersectional admissions processes that include race is essential to promoting equity and redressing systemic barriers to higher education.
