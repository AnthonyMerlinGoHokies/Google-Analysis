https://college.unc.edu/2021/03/universal-basic-income/,  By Melissa Stewart Unconditional cash payments to residents are more of a floor to stand on than a safety net say these Carolina scholars in light of a proposed pilot project to give 500 per month to formerly incarcerated Durham North Carolina residents. The idea of governments giving residents nostringsattached cash payments is picking up steam due in part to the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Last June Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton California created Mayors for a Guaranteed Income a coalition to advocate for a guaranteed income direct recurring cash payments that lifts all of our communities building a resilient just America.  Durham Mayor Steve Schewel joined the group. In January Schewel announced that Durham was one of 30 U.S. cities being considered to receive a 500000 slice of a 15 million gift from Twitter cofounder and CEO Jack Dorsey. The money would fund Universal Basic Income pilot projects such as the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration. Durham council member MarkAnthony Middleton announced that Durham s proposed project would guarantee 500 per month to 55 formerly incarcerated residents until the pandemic ends and the city s economy recovers. Before the pandemic hit 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang put UBI also known as guaranteed basic income on the map by making it his signature policy. His proposed Freedom Dividend 1000 per month payments to every American adult was a response to job displacement by automation. For a deeper understanding of this issue The Well spoke with two Carolina faculty members who have studied UBI. Fabian Wendt a teaching assistant professor in the College of Arts Sciences philosophy department and the philosophy politics economics program first came across UBI while studying theories of distributive justice. Doug MacKay associate professor in the College s public policy department grew interested in UBI through research into paternalism in the U.S. social safety net. Wendt It is a regular cash payment by the government that is given on a monthly or annual basis. It s unconditional in several respects. In contrast to many other welfare programs that you only get when you prove your willingness to work a UBI would be unconditional in that respect. It would also be unconditional on what money you make what you have in general and on what contribution you made to finance the UBI. Finally it would be unconditional on your family situation on whether you re married or not. UBI is probably best conceived as a floor to stand on not as a safety net. A safety net is only meant to catch you when you need it which requires some institution to test whether you really need it and that opens up all these worries about paternalism bureaucracy and so on whereas the UBI would be a floor to stand on for everybody. MacKay I completely agree with Fabian s description. UBI is a platform to stand on and to build a life on. But it s not something that s going to allow you to live a great life. The sort of numbers that we re talking about are at most 1000 a month per person. People will still have a strong motivation to work. MacKay The goals really differ depending on the policymaker but also on who s proposing it. I think for a lot of folks on the left they see it as more a platform to build your life on. So it s going to be there for you when you when you need it. If you think about the pandemic when people are losing their jobs it takes a long time for government to react. Had we had a basic income in place that would have been a way of ensuring people are secure have the ability to meet their basic needs and live a dignified human life. They don t need to appeal to various agencies. They have consistency in terms of being able to afford housing food and so on. It s an antipoverty measure. You also see from people on the left the idea of UBI as promoting freedom. Oftentimes we talk about freedom as being freedom from constraints. Some folks on the right libertarians in particular emphasize the need for government to stay out of our lives. And thinkers on the left often point out that if people are just leaving you alone you might be unlimited in terms of choices but you re not actually going to be able to do anything unless you have resources. So the idea is that if people have a platform to build their lives off they have resources every month. They can actually do things. They can meet their needs. They can pursue various projects. On the right side of the political spectrum people see UBI as potentially realizing a number of goals. One they emphasize this is antipaternalistic in nature. There s an element of government not interfering with the lives of individuals by imposing all these conditionalities on them but rather just letting them be free to live their lives as they see fit with the income. The other thing that folks on the right emphasize is the way UBI might allow you to shrink the size of government. People on the left often think of basic income as something we re going to add to the safety net and keep much of the safety net intact. People on the right often see it as a replacement We re going to give people a guaranteed income and we re going to get rid of a whole host of social safety net programs that cost a lot of money and require a lot of people to administer. Wendt One thing I found interesting about Andrew Yang s proposal was his idea to let people choose whether they either take the UBI or keep the benefits from current programs. Another thing different proponents will disagree upon is how high UBI should be. A thousand dollars a month was Yang s proposal but you could also go much lower or much higher. Maybe even as high as is sustainable as Belgian philosopher and economist and chief UBI proponent Philippe Van Parijs would say. Its sustainability will depend on how high it is pitched but also on how it s financed. It seems very natural to think that it would be financed through the income tax. That would make it a close relative to a negative income tax proposal which was popular in the 1960s and 70s. The influential American economist Milton Friedman was a famous advocate of that. But Andrew Yang and others propose a mix in terms of how it s financed. It could also be a sales tax or capital income tax or some other way. Wendt UBI has often been seen as a response to the challenge of automation the worry that many people are going to become unemployed and replaced by machines. For example truck drivers will lose their jobs once there are automated trucks. In the end that s not a new concern though. People have worried that machines would replace jobs at least since the 19th century but usually new types of jobs were always created elsewhere. The idea of a UBI was brought up last spring as a response to the pandemic an emergency UBI. The coronavirus hit so hard. Many people felt like this was a chance to get some serious reform of the welfare state going. In the end we got the stimulus checks instead which were not completely different but a onetime thing and not unconditional. The checks depended on how much you earned. One thing to emphasize is also how UBI would empower women. It gives working mothers cash to pay for childcare for example or it makes it easier to leave an abusive husband if you have something to rely on that is independent from the family situation. MacKay The other thing I would point to are concerns about income inequality. I don t think this is necessarily a great solution to the problem of income inequality but I think the economic anxiety leads people to UBI. MacKay There s been a variety of studies. There were a couple of really famous experiments in the 70s in Canada and here in the United States. There was a really interesting study in Manitoba in the late 70s where they had a whole town that was subject to a guaranteed income policy a floor that families would not fall below. A lot of randomized controlled trials in lowincome countries have been using cash transfers since the late 80s early 90s. Some of these are conditional cash transfers. In Mexico for example you might get a cash transfer from the government if you send your kids to school and take them for yearly doctor visits. And there was one recently in Finland where they gave 500 per month to unemployed folks. These are highquality studies. The evidence has shown that the UBI programs are pretty effective in a number of different ways. The caveat I would give is that they happen in different contexts and the interventions are very different. Wendt An experiment in Kenya is the largest. It involves around 20000 people and unconditional cash payments that cover basic needs. It started in 2017 and will last 12 years. There are four different groups. One group gets the cash for the whole 12 years. Another group gets paid up front rather than on a monthly basis I believe. Another group receives payments for a shorter period of time. And then there s a control group that doesn t get any cash. Some people reported that it has changed how women see their role in the household because they felt entitled to have a say over how to spend the money. MacKay A big one is a reciprocity worry that in order to get access to public benefits you should be at least willing to participate in the labor market. Think of the earnedincome tax credit. That s a cash transfer that goes to lowincome Americans. But to get access to it you need to be participating in the labor force. A lot of programs like SNAP the federal government s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program also known as the Food Stamp Program and TANF Temporary Assistance for Needy Families another federal program have work requirements attached to them. The Trump administration was trying to attach a work requirement to Medicaid programs as well. The thought is you should only get access to public benefits if you are participating in the formal labor market and earning an income. The question they ask is Why should some group of individuals be participating in the labor force and paying taxes to fund a UBI for other people who aren t participating in the labor market? One of the responses to this is that UBI recognizes all those forms of contribution to society that aren t remunerated. Think about parents taking care of their children or poor people taking care of elderly family members. There s lots of ways in which people contribute to society. And you can think of a UBI as reciprocating in that sense remunerating people for those contributions. Wendt Another common worry is that UBI is a waste of money on the wealthy. Why should all of those wealthy people get a monthly check? If the goal is to do something about poverty then why UBI since the rich by definition are not poor? That s an understandable concern for sure. But the reply there is that depending on how the UBI is financed the rich will not be net beneficiaries. They will contribute more to finance the UBI than what they get as their monthly check. MacKay This is the first time I ve heard of a guaranteed income program that s aimed at people coming out of prison. I think it makes perfect sense. Part of the justification here is that people with a felony record face a lot of difficulty in terms of accessing other public programs. I think they re actually banned for at least some period of time from federal housing programs and from receiving SNAP benefits. Felons face a lot of difficulty getting jobs. Employers can legitimately ask if they have a record and deny them employment on that basis. So it makes a lot of sense that you would target this type of pilot project at those folks. If you think about who needs a platform in American society it s going to be people who don t have access to these other programs and are economically vulnerable in terms of not being able to get a job. And so I think it makes a lot of sense that you would target the program this way. Oftentimes we discuss UBI as a major transformation to society as a sort of utopian policy. That draws a lot of attention. But I think the discussion might lead to a simpler idea just using cash payments in more of our social safety net programs. That might be more sustainable more cost effective than trying to try to implement a full UBI type policy. For that reason what s happening in Durham a guaranteed income for a very narrow group of individuals is really interesting. One thing the pandemic has shown us is that the government got a little bit more comfortable with giving cash payments to people. Another thing I m really excited about are these proposals to expand the child tax credit both coming from Mitt Romney and also coming from the Democrats which you might think of as a basic income for kids. Every month they would get a certain amount of money maybe a few hundred dollars. The parents decide how to spend it but the thought is it s kind of like a baseline for kids. We don t want to spend too much time focusing on the big UBI utopian policy proposals and miss that there s a lot of interesting and potentially really important costeffective policy proposals around using cash payments in very targeted ways.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/10/24/universal-basic-income/, When Everett had first heard about SEED a few weeks earlier she d wondered if it might be a scam as things that sound too good to be true often are. Her pastor assured her that it was real that 125 residents of poor neighborhoods in Stockton Calif. would receive money as part of a groundbreaking experiment. When she got the call Everett thought she was receiving a onetime payment which was thrilling enough. Then the woman on the phone told her she d receive 500 every month for a year and a half with no strings attached. She nearly collapsed from joy right there in the airport. Suddenly Everett who in 2018 had lost her job as a Department of Defense logistics specialist had subsequently tried to make ends meet by driving for DoorDash then had taken out significant unsubsidized loans to attend college online in a bid to improve her employment prospects saw a path back to stability. She would be able to cover her car payments and the rent to keep her phone on without giving up her monthly tithe to her church. For Mayor Michael Tubbs that was exactly the point. Since childhood Tubbs had watched his mom and his friends struggle with everyday expenses while receiving only minimal help from the government in Stockton one of the poorest cities in the country which sits in California s Central Valley. He theorized that a relatively small guaranteed income just 6000 a year per recipient enough to cover the occasional emergency expense or supplement a minimumwage salary would singlehandedly eliminate the insecurity that governed the lives of many poor Stockton residents. And so with funds and guidance from the nonprofit Economic Security Project he created a pilot program one of the first of its kind in the country. His goal was as simple as it was ambitious to run a demonstration project so successful that national politicians would have no choice but to consider adopting guaranteed income as national policy. Sitting in a Stockton Starbucks nearly three years later a softspoken Everett remembered nearly every detail of that fateful phone call from SEED. Swaddled in a white puffer coat on an unseasonably cold day her hair in a low bun she looked younger than her 51 years as she cradled a caramel Frappuccino and choked up as she described the immediate impact the payments had on her life. She quit driving for DoorDash which gave her the time to find a job as a factory worker at Tesla s plant in Fremont 60 miles from Stockton. She was able to escape a dysfunctional marriage and move into her own home. For me it was a steppingstone. It got me to where I was okay by myself she says. It was right on time. Everything in me was just like Oh thank you so much Lord.  The SEED program was scheduled to end in the summer of 2020 but its founders secured additional donations to fund an extra six months to get people through the worst days of the pandemic. That was another lifesaver for Everett who was diagnosed with a severe case of covid19 and struggled with lingering symptoms leaving her unable to work for most of that year. Fortunately the 500 a month from SEED plus disability payments proved to be enough to pay her bills. If you just learned about guaranteed income in the past few years chances are it was from the presidential campaign of Andrew Yang who got a lot of attention for his proposal that the government offer 1000 monthly payments to all Americans. But versions of this concept had been circulating for decades among academics and progressive activists. And as the country shut down in the early days of the pandemic the conditions appeared ripe to try something new something radical. Pilot programs launched in Los Angeles in New Orleans in Denver but also in historically less progressive cities like Birmingham Ala. Columbia S.C. and Gainesville Fla. In March 2020 even a vast majority of congressional Republicans backed a 2 trillion stimulus bill that included unconditional cash payments for tens of millions of Americans. Since then the Mayors for a Guaranteed Income coalition which grew out of SEED has swelled to more than 90 members and three dozen programs a 15 million donation from Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey helped fund many of the pilots. Now though as the country emerges from the pandemic the guaranteed income movement sits at a crossroads. The pilot programs have created scores of stories like Everett s about how a small amount of money led to massive change in a recipient s life. And a growing body of research based on the experiments shows that guaranteed income works that it pulls people out of poverty improves health outcomes and makes it easier for people to find jobs and take care of their children. If empirical evidence ruled the world guaranteed income would be available to every poor person in America and many of those people would no longer be poor. But empirical evidence does not rule the world and it is far from clear that there is a political path forward for guaranteed income on a large scale. The citylevel experiments cannot last forever Stockton s lapsed in early 2021 a few months after Tubbs lost his reelection bid to a Republican successor who showed no interest in trying to keep SEED going. On Capitol Hill too political momentum for handing out cash has waned. At the end of 2021 an extension of the expanded child tax credit which was seen by many advocates as a key steppingstone to guaranteed income was blocked by a Democrat representing the state with the sixthhighest poverty rate in the country. Early in the pandemic some in the guaranteedincome movement had begun to whisper about accelerating the timeline for taking their efforts nationwide. America s most progressive social policies have always grown out of economic crises so maybe covid would bring about a guaranteedincome policy in the next few years. But the failure of the expanded federal child tax credit diminished some of that optimism many of those same advocates are now looking toward the long game. You have to be willing to fight for something to the end says Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott who recently launched a guaranteedincome experiment even if it doesn t happen even if you only push it a few feet further even if it means that you die doing it.  Without a radical solution like say giving people money with no strings attached America will continue to be home to one of the worst rates of income inequality of any rich nation in the world. And from city to city there is massive energy and momentum to keep expanding this experiment. But true believers also harbor a sense of anxiety about what the future holds. I m worried says Sean Kline the associate director of Stanford University s Basic Income Lab that these guaranteed income demonstrations are going to sunset and then it s just going to go quiet.  For as long as America has had a poverty problem which is to say for its entire history a small group of dreamers has proposed guaranteed income as a solution. The idea dates to the year the country was founded Thomas Paine proposed a type of basic income in his 1776 pamphlet Common Sense. In the mid20th century it gained traction among Black American thinkers In 1966 the Black Panthers TenPoint Program demanded employment or a guaranteed income for everyone. A year later the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote in his last book Where Do We Go From Here Chaos or Community? that government aid programs all have a common failing they are indirect. Each seeks to solve poverty by first solving something else. I am now convinced that the simplest approach will prove to be the most effective the solution to poverty is to abolish it directly by a now widely discussed measure the guaranteed income.  The first official proposal for a federal basic income program though came not from a paragon of progressivism but from Richard Nixon. In 1969 Nixon introduced the Family Assistance Plan which would have provided additional cash to poor families through a negative income tax cutting checks to the poorest Americans instead of them paying the government of 1600 about 13000 today for a family of four. The proposal was motivated by Nixon s desire to replace the welfare system which was unpopular with White bluecollar voters but it never made it out of the Senate Finance Committee. Many skeptical politicians and voters feared that giving people cash would allow them to quit their jobs stop looking for work or work less. Around the same time a series of negativeincometax experiments benefiting about 7500 people in six states appeared to confirm those concerns In Seattle and Denver where the two largest programs took place married men worked an average of 7 percent fewer hours after three years of the program while married and single women worked 17 percent fewer hours. And while researchers didn t look at any other measures of stability whether participants were more likely to seek medical care for example or whether their children missed fewer days of school they did observe a modest increase in the divorce rate. Those two factors were enough to destroy widespread interest in guaranteedincome experiments for several decades. Over time however interpretations of the 1970s experiments have morphed. Participants don t seem to have dropped out of the labor force entirely suggesting that the money may have given them the luxury of waiting a little longer for the right job to come around instead of rushing into the first available option. And working less sometimes means getting more education which is almost always a net positive for the economy. An uptick in divorces can be a good thing too Studies show that financial insecurity is a major contributor to keeping women in failing relationships as in Everett s case. In retrospect the legacy of the first significant guaranteedincome pilots was a whole lot of complicated questions and limited information with which to answer them. Meanwhile the concept of conditional cashtransfer programs in other words paying poor people for desirable behavior was gaining steam in middleincome countries like Mexico and Brazil. In 2007 New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg launched a program called Opportunity NYC which rewarded parents for tasks like taking their children to the doctor and completing jobtraining courses. The experiment had a moderate positive effect on families overall finances but did not boost academic performance among elementaryschoolers or increase families likelihood to seek preventive medical care researchers found. Bloomberg did not extend the program when it expired in 2010. Among many poverty scholars and activists conditional cash transfers are seen as a step in the right direction but only a small one. To maximize the impact on poor people s lives they say money must be a right not a reward because that s the only way to empower people to make their own choices. There are positive outcomes from conditional cash there are positive outcomes from unconditional cash Kline says. But I think for me making it conditional misses a really fundamental value around trust dignity agency freedom.  The word dignity comes up a lot among guaranteedincome advocates. Research shows that the vast majority of people don t waste cash on vices like drugs and alcohol but rather use even small amounts to improve their life circumstances dramatically. In a 2019 working paper Nobel Prizewinning development economist Abhijit Banerjee and two coauthors concluded that the distribution of unconditional cash in lowincome countries had positive effects on income assets savings borrowing total expenditure food expenditure dietary diversity school attendance test scores cognitive development use of health facilities labor force participation child labor migration domestic violence women s empowerment marriage fertility and use of contraception among others.  Banerjee is part of the research team studying the world s largest basicincome program which is midway through a 12year run across 300 rural villages in Kenya. For about 5000 people that means an extra 22 a month for more than a decade. Thus far the researchers have found participants have been less likely to get sick or go hungry and more likely to start a business. In the United States which has the world s largest gross domestic product the basicincome calculus is different than in places like Kenya where a significant minority of people live on less than a dollar a day. But America has its own unique factors like that inequality rate and a history of racist policies that have left a disproportionate number of people of color at the bottom of the income scale. Indeed Tubbs and his counterparts frame basic income as something akin to reparations a way to alleviate harm done to marginalized people by decades of biased and ineffective policy. The SEED recipients were struggling to survive because society had let them down Tubbs argues and the conventional methods of helping them were paternalistic and inadequate. In Baltimore where more than 1 in 5 residents live below the federal poverty line a new guaranteedincome pilot gives 1000 a month to 200 recipients all of them parents in highcrime neighborhoods. We re like the birthplace of racial redlining right? Scott says. You re not going to erase inequality inequity that was caused by policy without creating policy to do the opposite.  The notion of guaranteed income as a governmentbacked corrective for decades of racist policies has spread to dozens of cities many led by young Black mayors. Scott 38 consults regularly with St. Louis Mayor Tishaura Jones 50 whose city launched a guaranteedincome pilot in December 2021. St. Paul Minn. Mayor Melvin Carter 43 serves as cochair of Mayors for a Guaranteed Income and is a mentor to Tubbs 32. According to Tubbs guaranteedincome programs in Columbia S.C. Shreveport La. and Atlanta were the result of a Black mayors group text shortly after George Floyd s murder in which he evangelized for King s approach to solving urban poverty before sending everyone a copy of Where Do We Go From Here.  It s no coincidence that these are the people plotting the future of guaranteed income in America Scott argues. Many of them grew up in families that would have benefited from guaranteedincome programs. We re the first group of elected folks who actually lived through all of the s he said looking up from his phone for a rare moment during a 30minute interview at Baltimore City Hall and drawing out the vowel sound in lived. We lived through crack and heroin. We lived through zero tolerance. So all the stuff that folks are now talking about we understand it in a way that no one else will.  The most basic objection to guaranteedincome programs is about cost. Providing 1000 a month to every American regardless of income which some scholars argue would make the policy more palatable than one targeted to people in poverty would cost 3.1 trillion a year nearly half the federal government s entire budget in 2021. And yet the adage that it is expensive to be poor applies not just to individuals but to their governments. A mountain of evidence shows how tightly income inequality correlates with crime rates education levels drug abuse incarceration intimatepartner violence and physical and mental health which together cost billions upon billions of tax dollars. Numerous studies for example have found it would be cheaper to give homes to unhoused people than it is to cover all the costs associated with allowing them to stay on the streets but progressives have faced an uphill climb to convince policymakers and voters that providing free housing is a worthwhile strategy. While there isn t yet research on the potential economic benefits of guaranteed income specifically studies of similar initiatives have shown that pulling people out of poverty generates a huge increase in tax revenue as well as savings on public assistance programs. First though the guaranteedincome movement had to show that its idea worked at all. When the current wave of experiments kicked off the goal was to drown opponents in data demonstrating that the simplest idea for alleviating poverty was in fact the silver bullet it appeared to be. Of course whether something works depends on the definition. Obviously giving people more money makes them less poor but the Stockton Economic Empowerment Demonstration team set out to show that as little as 500 a month not nearly enough to replace actual income would have a multiplier effect allowing recipients to improve their employment prospects their physical health and mental wellbeing their children s education and their overall stability. A research team from the University of Pennsylvania s Center for Guaranteed Income Research laid out three overarching questions How does guaranteed income affect volatility? To what degree do changes in income volatility alter financial wellbeing psychological distress and physical functioning? How does guaranteed income generate agency over one s future? To conduct their randomized controlled trial the Penn researchers tracked purchases on the debit cards provided to the 125 recipients asked recipients and controlgroup members to input monthly income data and conducted biannual surveys to learn how people s lives were going. The questions focused on recipients wellbeing but also on some of the most common objections to guaranteed income Did they quit their jobs content to live on free money ? Did they blow all their funds on cigarettes and liquor?  I never came in asking for permission Tubbs said on a sweltering November day in Los Angeles where he moved after losing his reelection bid in Stockton. I was not ready for a vote I was going to do this. But I did go in wanting to make sure I understood sort of where the sentiment was where the opposition was. I said Well look we ll evaluate this and see how the money is spent and we ll see who s right.  In March 2021 the researchers released preliminary data from the first year of the pilot. While their first peerreviewed paper is still in the works their selfreported results showed an unqualified success. More than 50 percent of recipients said they could pay for a 400 emergency expense in cash compared with 25 percent before the program began and 28 percent of the control group. Recipients experienced statistically significant improvements in their mental health as determined by a common test of psychological wellbeing. Importantly for Tubbs and other politicians looking to sell conservatives on guaranteed income the study found that SEED participants were more likely to find fulltime employment than members of the control group. Recipients spent the biggest share of their cash on food followed by other merchandise utility bills and gas and car maintenance. Less than 1 percent of the total allotted funds were used to buy tobacco or alcohol. Honestly I don t think SEED could have gone any better Kline says. I m astounded at what a small little demonstration can do.  A year later data from a D.C.based guaranteedincome experiment showed similarly promising results. Thrive East of the River provided 5500 to 600 families in Ward 8 during the pandemic either as a lump sum or as five monthly payments. Although the program was too shortterm to measure effects on employment Urban Institute researchers found significant positive effects on recipients mental health food security and ability to meet their children s needs. Thrive wasn t part of the mayors consortium launching guaranteedincome pilots but policymakers embraced the Urban Institute data as an important part of the overall work.  Even my staff cautioned me about being so optimistic and confident but I was going to bet on people Tubbs said tilting back in his chair in the messy shedturnedoffice that sits behind his home in a historically Black neighborhood of L.A. The SEED results were particularly vindicating because everyone was like We need cash but there were all these racist tropes. And the opposite of all the tropes is what the data showed was true.  The question Tubbs and his allies did not originally confront however is what would happen if they showed that guaranteed income works but still didn t convince enough lawmakers to support it. Toward the end of 2021 guaranteedincome advocates got a harsh lesson on the limitation of data when it comes to winning the hearts and minds of policymakers and voters. Earlier that year in response to the pandemic President Biden had signed a dramatically expanded version of the child tax credit CTC. Suddenly parents would be paid as much as 3600 per child per year up from 2000. But there was a bigger change too The money became fully refundable meaning parents would receive the funds even if their total tax liability was lower than the credit itself. Historically the poorest onethird of parents didn t benefit from the CTC because they pay the least in taxes. Now they would receive an extra several thousand dollars a year delivered monthly essentially a small guaranteed income. Scholars called it one of the most important moves to fight poverty since the creation of Social Security. As soon as parents began receiving the extra CTC funds several groups of researchers began studying the results. We were hopeful that people would be able to see the immediate benefits the poverty reduction that was happening but also the impacts for families in terms of reducing stress and the ability to afford the basics says Chris Wimer who coled one such team at Columbia University s Center on Poverty and Social Policy. With that proof of effectiveness in hand Wimer hoped Congress would feel compelled to make the policy permanent. A separate Columbia study found that a permanent expansion would have generated 10 times as much revenue as it cost. But ultimately none of that mattered. The Build Back Better bill which included a oneyear extension of the CTC expansion narrowly passed the U.S. House in November 2021 but all 50 Senate Republicans opposed it. When Biden s negotiations with Sen. Joe Manchin III a conservative Democrat from West Virginia broke down just before the holiday break Biden stopped publicly advocating for the new version of the CTC. After the expanded CTC ran out Wimer and other scholars found that child poverty rates increased immediately spiking 41 percent in the first month. About 1 in 7 American children lives below the poverty line which at just 27750 for a family of four dramatically underestimates the number who are simply too poor to eat well or to have consistent electricity access or to afford registration fees for school sports. The child tax credit saga forced many in the guaranteedincome movement to give up the hope that a federal policy was imminent. Advocates talk openly about the lessons they learned including that statistics are not sufficient and that upfront costs feel more tangible than longterm fiscal benefits. A partial solution to both problems they believe is encouraging recipients to tell their own stories rather than being rendered anonymous in a list of statistics. Nearly every guaranteedincome pilot program selects a small subset of recipients Zohna Everett was one to speak publicly about their experiences providing them professional media training. The chosen storytellers are taught to focus on specific details what emergency expense were they able to cover with their guaranteed income? what smaller treat whether a restaurant meal or a night away from home did they splurge on? how could they tell their children were feeling more stable? and several pop up regularly in national media outlets.  We have a goal of changing or challenging narratives around people says Juliana Bidadanure a philosophy professor at Stanford and director of the university s Basic Income Lab. That s long slow work the current initiatives are like adding a few individual stones to the base of a cathedral so grand it might not be completed for decades. It s always about more than just actual policy. It s about how we view each other and when we think of each other as deserving of support and when we don t and what stands in the way. And if we understand that and we make progress on that we make progress on many other things.  Despite the setbacks at the federal level philanthropic interest in guaranteed income continues to increase and the body of research on local programs continues to grow. No two experiments work exactly the same way some are only for people making under a certain income others are limited to certain neighborhoods or just for single parents making each city feel like its own laboratory. Still as in any movement especially one where the greatest energy is at the local level there are disagreements some over substance and others over who gets the most attention. Unanswered questions range from the fundamental should guaranteed income be provided to everyone or more narrowly targeted to lift people out of poverty? to the ultraspecific should money be provided on prepaid debit cards or via online transfers? and there is plenty of jockeying among movement leaders over who knows best. Three hundred and fifty miles down Interstate 5 from Stockton the Compton Pledge has replaced SEED as the nation s buzziest guaranteedincome experiment. The key difference While most pilots are designed to investigate whether basic income works the team in Compton sees that question as too obvious to merit discussion. Instead they are studying the factors that make it work best. Now we know that we should do this policy says Nika SoonShiong the Compton Pledge s codirector. The question is really how. And unless we get more futureoriented thinking about how and asking questions to inform the answer we re going to fail.  SoonShiong 29 stands out among movement leaders. Its most visible proponents are Black she is the daughter of ethnically Chinese natively South African parents. She didn t grow up in Compton and she began studying basic income as a PhD student at Oxford University. And whereas many guaranteedincome advocates talk in detail about how a policy would have helped their own families her father is billionaire bioscientist Patrick SoonShiong who owns the Los Angeles Times and a share of the Lakers. She also voices a more radical case for guaranteed income laced with language about prison abolition defunding the police and reparations. SoonShiong is uncommonly focused on the nittygritty of guaranteedincome programs. The 800 Compton Pledge recipients are split into several groups Some receive money biweekly others monthly quarterly or in one lump sum and amounts range from 3600 to 7200 a year based on family size allowing researchers to draw conclusions about what schedule works best for recipients and how much is necessary to make a substantive difference. Participants can choose from four ways to receive their funds direct deposit Venmo PayPal or debit card and can track their payments find resources and ask questions on an online platform orders of magnitude more attractive and intuitive than any government website in the history of the internet. While a raft of thirdparty companies have begun competing for contracts to operate guaranteedincome pilot programs and payment systems Compton s homemade system is significantly cheaper meaning more money for actual people in need. While SoonShiong and Tubbs have a good relationship she is sensitive to the common narrative that he is the leader of the guaranteed income movement. You talk to Michael Tubbs and then you maybe put Nika in at the very end was how she summed up most reporting on the topic. Their relationship goes back to Stanford where she was a few years behind him. SEED executive director Sukhi Samra was two years behind SoonShiong Tubbs s connection to Jack Dorsey which led to Dorsey s 15 million donation to Mayors for a Guaranteed Income also came through Stanford. And while Tubbs did play a role in the Compton Pledge introducing SoonShiong to thenMayor Aja Brown she is quick to make clear that she asked for the connection then presented Brown a 14page intricately detailed proposal because she was independently committed to creating a guaranteedincome pilot. Last year SoonShiong submitted a proposal for the Compton Pledge s parent organization Fund for Guaranteed Income FGI to oversee a pilot program in neighboring Los Angeles her hometown. Instead L.A. chose to work with Mayors for a Guaranteed Income using a thirdparty payments platform instead of the one FGI created. She is occasionally exasperated that having what she sees as unequivocally the best product hasn t made her team the recognized leader in the field describing the Compton Pledge as the black sheep of the movement. She s also concerned that an endless string of pilots showing the same results isn t an effective way of building on the momentum created early in the pandemic.  We know that we are the best at what we do and it is disheartening and frustrating when the nonprofit world is centered around who s focusing the most on communications who is focusing the most on funder outreach she said sitting at the dining room table in her bright white West Hollywood apartment. We are focusing the most on how to build something that works and that s not really rewarded. I still think we re right. I still know we re doing it the right way and it just looks different from what others are doing.  Ask SoonShiong which other pilot programs are doing it the right way and she won t name the big ones launched by city governments this spring and summer in places like Baltimore New Orleans and Chicago. Instead she brings up some of the tiniest programs in the country ones less focused on the academic questions than simply putting money in people s hands. One of the pilots SoonShiong likes to promote the Bostonbased Community Love Fund started by funding five formerly incarcerated women in the Roxbury neighborhood with a budget of 30000 a year. After FGI came in as a partner in late 2021 the program expanded to 25 currently and formerly incarcerated women. A similar program the Chicago Future Fund is using FGI support to provide 500 a month to 30 formerly incarcerated residents in the West Garfield Park neighborhood entirely independently from the 31 million pilot the city launched this past summer. In the earliest days of the Community Love Fund program founder Andrea James says she asked the mayor of Boston for a small grant to support the group s work but was turned down which she now considers a gift. Running the program through her nonprofit the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women and Girls makes the program feel like mutual aid not a tool of the establishment. We re building alternate systems from within communities because even when we can get a city or state entity to work with us on things they mostly commandeer our language and then replicate something that is still attached to law enforcement attached to government bureaucracy attached to things that aren t communityled James says. Ultimately though getting more money to more people requires the type of massive funding that only governments can provide. FGI recently announced partnerships with two governmentrun programs in California one in Sonoma County and one in Long Beach. Tubbs meanwhile is now working as an adviser to California Gov. Gavin Newsom who last year approved a 35 million fund to create additional guaranteedincome pilots. I am a hyperpragmatist Tubbs says. Community Love Fund is great for the five women in Roxbury. It s going to change their lives. But there s thousands who need it and governments scale right?  Many of the newest pilots are doing their best to have it both ways running the program through the city government which allows them to combine philanthropic dollars with pandemicrelief funds but planning the details with an unusual level of input from ordinary residents. In Baltimore three representatives from neighborhood groups sat on the pilot steering committee alongside scholars lawyers and nonprofit executives. In July 2021 the group proposed three potential target populations for the pilot asking Mayor Scott to choose among young parents residents of neighborhoods with the highest crime rates or formerly incarcerated residents. Instead he asked for a hybrid approach 18 to 24yearold parents in highcrime neighborhoods all of them making under the city s median income. In August 200 young parents in Baltimore received their first 1000 payments of the twoyear pilot. By the time they get their last in summer 2024 the guaranteed income movement will be in a very different place. Where that will be no one is entirely sure. Perhaps the wave of evidencebased support for antipoverty initiatives will have grown into an unstoppable groundswell forcing conservatives and moderates to get on board. But it s disconcertingly easy to imagine the opposite that poverty rates continue to rise unchecked after a precipitous drop during the pandemic and most of us silently agree to look the other way. Back in Stockton Zohna Everett still hadn t been able to return to work as of September because of chronic illness and since her 500 a month ran out in early 2021 she has struggled to make ends meet. She s on a variety of state benefits programs picks up a little extra money doing nails for friends and neighbors and occasionally swallows her pride enough to accept handouts from church but it s never quite enough. A few months after SEED ended her car was repossessed. If the current pilots end without a clear path toward a larger policy thousands of people will be left in Everett s shoes. She remains thankful for the 12000 she received over the two years of SEED but these days an early poster child of guaranteed income s possibilities has yet again been left to fend for herself. Megan Greenwell is a journalist in New York. She is writing a book about private equity and how it affects workers.
https://www.procon.org/headlines/universal-basic-income-top-3-pros-and-cons/, UBI remains largely theoretical and thus does not have much of a history. Pilot UBI or more limited basic income programs that give a basic income to a smaller group of people instead of an entire population have taken place or are ongoing in Brazil Canada China Finland Germany India Iran Japan Kenya Namibia Spain and The Netherlands. 46  In the United States the Alaska Permanent Fund AFP created in 1976 is funded by oil revenues. AFP provides dividends to permanent residents of the state. The amount varies each year based on the stock market and other factors and has ranged from 331.29 1984 to 2072 2015. The payout for 2020 during the COVID19 pandemic was 992.00 the smallest check received since 2013. The most recent payment was 1312 for 2023. 46 47 48 49 58 UBI popped up in American news thanks to the 2020 presidential campaign of Andrew Yang whose continued promotion of a UBI resulted in the formation of a nonprofit Humanity Forward. 53  Some consider the stimulus payments from the federal government during the COVID19 pandemic to be a sort of emergency UBI. Those payments however were not unconditional but instead were calculated based on individual or family income. 59  A UBI set at 1000 per adult per month and 300 per child per month would eradicate US poverty entirely according to Scott Santens Founding Member of the Economic Security Project. 12  Case in point the poverty rate in Brazil fell to the lowest level in 40 years in just six months in 2020 after 110 600 reais a month was distributed to about 25 of the population as pandemic relief program called Bolsa Fam lia. 51  Namibia s UBI program trial the Basic Income Grant reduced household poverty rates from 76 of residents before the trial started to 37 after one year. Child malnutrition rates also fell from 42 to 17 in six months. 7  Participants in India s UBI trial said that UBI helped improve their health by enabling them to afford medicine improve sanitation gain access to clean water eat more regularly and reduce their anxiety levels.14  Mincome a trial UBI in Manitoba Canada found that hospitalizations for accidents injuries and mental health diagnoses declined during the trial. 1  Kenya s ongoing UBI trial has reportedly led to increased happiness and life satisfaction and to reduced stress and depression proving UBI could improve a range of mental health concerns and stressful situations proven to deteriorate mental health. 2   Recent research has linked the stress of poverty with inflammation in the brain UBI could be set at a level to ensure that everyone s basic needs are met. This would reduce much of the stress faced by the working poor or families on benefits UBI would also help people usually women and children to leave abusive relationships. Domestic abuse occurs more often in poorer households where victims lack the financial means to escape. Similarly UBI might prevent the negative childhood experiences believed to lead to mental illness and other problems later in life. These include experiencing violence or abuse or having parents with mental health substance abuse and legal problems. Behind these problems are often poverty inequality and social isolation says Matthew Smith professor in health history at the University of Strathclyde. 50  The guarantee of UBI protects people from sluggish wage growth low wages and the lack of job security caused by the effects of the growing gig economy as well as increased automation in the workplace. 42 5 10  Researchers from the Roosevelt Institute created three models for American implementation of UBI and found that under all scenarios UBI would grow the economy by increasing output employment prices and wages. 44  Since implementation of the Alaska Permanent Fund for example the increased purchasing power of UBI recipients has resulted in 10000 additional jobs for the state. 6  UBI would also give employees the financial security to leave a bad job or wait until the good job comes along to rejoin the job market. People won t have to take an awful job just to pay the bills. 54  Further UBI enables people to stay in school longer reducing dropout rates and to participate in training to improve skills or learn a trade improving their chances of getting a good job. Uganda s UBI trial the Youth Opportunities Program enabled participants to invest in skills training as well as tools and materials resulting in an increase of business assets by 57 work hours by 17 and earnings by 38. 8  The Canadian Mincome trial found that participants of the trial were more likely to complete high school than counterparts not involved in the trial. 1  The Basic Income Grant trial in Namibia 20072012 enabled parents to afford school fees buy school uniforms and encourage attendance. As a result school dropout rates fell from almost 40 in Nov. 2007 to 5 in June 2008 to almost 0 in Nov. 2008. 7  UBI makes all forms of work including childcare and eldercare equally deserving of payment. Almost definitionally a properly designed basic income system will reduce genderbased inequality because on average the payment will represent a higher share of women s income says Guy Standing professor of development studies at the University of London 25 56  A UBI also allows working parents to reduce their working hours in order to spend more time with their children or help with household chores. 26 27  Reviewing the UBI trial in India SEWA Bharat an organization related to women s employment and UNICEF a children s rights organization concluded that women s empowerment was one of the more important outcomes of this experiment noting that women receiving a UBI participated more in household decision making and benefited from improved access to food healthcare and education. 14  The Basic Income Grant Coalition trial in Namibia found that UBI reduced the dependency of women on men for their survival and reduced the pressure to engage in transactional sex. 7  Mincome the Canadian UBI trial found that emergency room visits as a result of domestic violence reduced during the period of the trial possibly because of the reduction in incomeinequality between women and men. 28  Universal Basic Income UBI takes money from the poor and gives it to everyone increasing poverty and depriving the poor of much needed targeted support.People experiencing poverty face a variety of hardships that are addressed with existing antipoverty measures such as food stamps medical aid and child assistance programs. UBI programs often use funds from these targeted programs for distribution to everyone without regard for need. 15   If you take the dollars targeted on people in the bottom fifth or twofifths of the population and convert them to universal payments to people all the way up the income scale you re redistributing income upward. That would increase poverty and inequality rather than reduce them according to Robert Greenstein President of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 15  Luke Martinelli research associate at the University of Bath created three models of UBI implementation and concluded that all three would lead to a significant number of individuals and households who are worse off. He notes these losses are not concentrated among richer groups on the contrary they are proportionally larger for the bottom three income quintiles. 37   Rather than reducing the overall headcount of those in poverty a BI basic income would change the composition of the incomepoor population and thus would not prove to be an effective tool for reducing poverty concludes Research by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD in Finland France Italy and the U.K. 39  UBI does not cure addiction poor health lack of skills or other factors that contribute to and exacerbate poverty making UBI less costeffective than targeted welfare programs. 19 24  There is the danger of UBI entrenching low pay and precarious work. It could effectively subsidise employers who pay low wages and by creating a small cushion for workers on shortterm and zerohours contracts help to normalise precarity explain Anna Coote of the New Economics Foundation and Edanur Yazici PhD student. UBI could become another American tipping system in which employers pay low wages and count on customers to fill in the gap with tips. 52  A 2000 a month per head of household UBI would cost an estimated 2.275 trillion annually says Marc Joffe Director of Policy Research at the California Policy Center. Some of this cost could be offset by eliminating federal state and local assistance programs however by Joffe s calculation these offsets total only 810 billion leaving a net budgetary cost of over 1.4 trillion for a universal basic income program. 23  A 2018 study found that a 1000 a month stipend to every adult in the United States would cost about 3.81 trillion per year or about 21 of the 2018 GDP or about 78 of 2018 tax revenue. 57  The UBI trial in Finland provided participants with 560 673 USD a month for two years. Finland s UBI model is impossibly expensive since it would increase the government deficit by about 5 percent explains lkka Kaukoranta Chief Economist of the Central Organization of Finnish Trade Unions SAK. 20 21  Former U.K. Minister of State for Employment Damian Hinds rejected the idea of UBI during parliamentary debate saying that the estimated implementation costs ranging from 8.2 billion 160 billion 10.8 billion 211 billion USD are clearly unaffordable. 38  Economist John Kay Research Fellow at the University of Oxford studied proposed UBI levels in Finland France Germany Switzerland the United Kingdom and the United States and concludes that in all of these countries UBI at a level which can guarantee an acceptable standard of living is impossibly expensive Either the level of basic income is unacceptably low or the cost of providing it is unacceptably high. 41  Earned income motivates people to work be successful work cooperatively with colleagues and gain skills. However if we pay people unconditionally to do nothing they will do nothing and this leads to a less effective economy says Charles Wyplosz professor of international economics at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. 33  The Swiss government opposed implementation of UBI stating that it would entice fewer people to work and thus exacerbate the current labor and skills shortages. 34  A strong economy relies on people being motivated to work hard and in order to motivate people there needs to be an element of uncertainty for the future. UBI providing guaranteed security removes this uncertainty according to economist Allison Schrager. 36  UBI would cause people to abjure work for a life of idle fun and would depress the willingness to produce and pay taxes of those who resent having to support them says Elizabeth Anderson professor of philosophy and women s studies at the University of Michigan. In fact guaranteed income trials in the United States in the 1960s and 1970s found that the people who received payments worked fewer hours. 9 17   The daily routines of existing workfree men should make proponents of the UBI think long and hard. Instead of producing new community activists composers and philosophers more paid worklessness in America might only further deplete our nation s social capital at a time when good citizenship is already in painfully short supply according to Nicholas Eberstadt and Evan Abramsky both at American Enterprise Institute AEI. 55  1.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/08/19/more-americans-oppose-than-favor-the-government-providing-a-universal-basic-income-for-all-adult-citizens/, The idea of the government providing a universal basic income for all adult citizens draws broad and intense opposition among Republicans but is generally supported by Democrats according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Nearly eightinten Republicans and Republicanleaning independents 78 oppose the federal government providing a universal basic income of about 1000 per person with 62 strongly opposed. A smaller share of Democrats and Democratic leaners 66 favor a UBI with just a third supporting the proposal strongly. UBI was the centerpiece of former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang s campaign. Yang is scheduled to speak to the Democratic National Convention on Aug. 20 shortly before Joe Biden accepts the party s presidential nomination. Pew Research Center conducted this study to understand Americans views of the federal government providing a guaranteed income for all adult citizens. For this analysis we conducted an online survey of 11001 U.S. adults between July 27 and Aug. 2 2020. Everyone who took part is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology. There also are wide age race and income differences in views of the government providing a universal basic income of about 1000 for each adult citizen whether or not they work. Adults under age 30 favor the government providing a UBI by roughly twotoone 67 to 33. There is far less support among older adults 72 of those 65 and older oppose the proposal while just 26 are in favor. Majorities of Black 73 and Hispanic adults 63 favor the government providing a UBI compared with 35 of White adults. And while the proposal draws broad opposition from adults in upper and middleincome households a 63 majority of those in lowerincome households favor it. In both parties younger adults and those with lower incomes express higher levels of support for the federal government providing a UBI for all adult citizens. While majorities of Republicans across age groups oppose the UBI proposal 41 of Republicans ages 18 to 34 favor it by far the highest share of any GOP age group. Among Democrats support for a UBI also is much higher among adults ages 18 to 34 than among older people. About fourinten Republicans in lowerincome households 43 favor the government providing a universal basic income compared with 17 of those with middle incomes and just 8 of those with upper incomes. There are similar income differences among Democrats. Still Democrats across income and age categories are far more likely than Republicans in those groups to favor a universal basic income. There are also racial and ethnic differences in these views among Democrats though majorities of Black 77 Hispanic 70 and White Democrats 61 support the federal government providing a universal basic income for all adult citizens. Note Here are the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology. CORRECTION Jan. 5 2021 In the chart Young people favor a universal basic income by about twotoone much less support among older adults the label for the total strongly favor amount has been updated to 23 to correct a typographical error.

https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/15/how-likely-universal-basic-income-is-in-the-us.html, For more than a year Americans have been expressing their frustration with work by quitting their jobs altogether. More than 4 million people quit their jobs in May 2022 alone according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Their reasons vary. Some want better pay or benefits others are escaping a toxic workplace and bad management and others are seeking a new career according to a 2022 Q1 Joblist survey of 18617 jobseekers. When it comes to solutions for alleviating Americans frustration with work job seekers cite options like raising the minimum wage and mandating a shorter work week. And nearly a fifth 19 of jobseekers think a universal basic income could help. UBI is a policy in which citizens receive a regular stipend from the government say on a monthly basis to be used at their discretion. At the moment there is no developed country that has a significant universal cash transfer that goes to literally everybody in the population that also has no conditions says Ioana Marinescu an associate professor at the University of Pennsylvania whose podcast Just Economics discusses similar issues. So how likely is that to happen in the U.S. and could it really solve workers problems? There have been experiments both around the world and in the U.S. that offer people a regular income to use at their discretion. Beginning in February 2019 for example 125 residents of Stockton California received a monthly stipend of 500 over the course of 24 months through a citywide initiative. And they did find that fulltime employment increased says Donna Pavetti vice president for family income support policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.  It just gave people some flexibility she says So if they were working two parttime jobs they could cut back which gave them time to look for a better job.  A study of 25 residents of Hudson New York who began receiving 500 per month in the fall of 2020 on behalf of research organization the Jain Family Institute found similar results. Participants employment both full and parttime grew from 29 to 63 and their physical and mental health improved as well. One key component of these studies is that they are all targeted in some way says Pavetti adding that they may be targeted to single moms or and they may be targeted to a neighborhood that has a high concentration of people with low incomes.  And in fact if this kind of policy was ever implemented these lowincome populations would likely benefit the most.  To the extent that a basic income would be the same for everybody and presumably not very high this would only help lowincome workers says Marinescu. It would not help higher income workers because the amount is not necessarily high enough to provide a reasonable cushion in the same way for higher income workers.  Though on a federal level policymakers have never implemented UBI recent policies have come close. The most similar thing we have are things like the Child Tax Credit says Marinescu adding that that s not literally universal but for anybody who has kids it gives them cash without any further conditions.  The pandemicera policy gave families access to payments of 300 per month for children under 6yearsold and 250 per month for children ages 6 through 17 up to 3600 for the former and 3000 for the latter. There were also the famous stimulus checks says Marinescu. So these went to 90 of the U.S. population without any condition.  The problem with UBI specifically is you have to raise the taxes to finance it says Marinescu. To match monthly sums to the average American income would take a steep increase. Even one lower than the average income would imply a significant hike in tax rates she says. That could outweigh the benefits for many families. Ultimately with any of these programs the question is she says as a society are we willing to tax ourselves to get a system like this in place?

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/basic-income.asp,  Universal basic income UBI is the concept of a government program in which every adult citizen receives a set amount of money regularly. The goals of a basic income system are to alleviate poverty and replace other needbased social programs that potentially require greater bureaucratic involvement. The idea of universal basic income has gained momentum in the U.S. as automation increasingly replaces workers in manufacturing and other sectors of the economy.  The idea of providing a basic income to all members of society goes back centuries. The 16thcentury English philosopher and statesman Thomas More mentions the idea in his bestknown work Utopia.  Thomas Paine a pamphleteer whose ideas helped spur the American Revolution proposed a tax plan in which revenues would provide a basic government income.  And Martin Luther King Jr. proposed guaranteed income in his book Where Do We Go from Here Chaos or Community? published in 1967.  While the federal government provides financial support for lowincome Americans through the earnedincome tax credit EITC Temporary Assistance for Needy Families TANF and other programs a system of universal income has never taken hold in the United States.  However the concept has risen to the national consciousness since around 2020. Much of renewed interest on the subject has to do with fundamental changes to the economy namely the growth of automation that threaten to leave many Americans without jobs that pay a subsistence wage.  In 2023 researchers at OpenAI a leading artificial intelligence AI research organization and the University of Pennsylvania published a working paper analyzing the impact of the technology on the labor market. Per their analysis 80 of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10 of their work tasks affected by large language models a type of AI that can process and generate text. According to the study 19 of workers could see 50 or more of their tasks impacted.  Supporters of universal basic income believe a guaranteed payment from the government can help ensure that those who are left behind by this economic transformation avoid poverty. Even if governmentsourced income isn t enough to live on it could theoretically supplement the income from the lowerwage or parttime jobs they are still able to obtain.  Proponents also believe that a universal payment system would make it easier for people to receive assistance who are in need but have trouble qualifying for other government programs. Some Americans seeking disability insurance payments for example may lack access to the health care system thereby hindering their ability to verify their impediment.  Many of UBI s supporters come from the more liberal end of the political spectrum including former Labor Secretary Robert Reich and past head of the influential Service Employees International Union Andy Stern.  However support for a governmentsupplied income stream has been endorsed by several prominent figures on the right as well.  Among them is the late conservative economist Milton Friedman who suggested that private charitable contributions aren t enough to alleviate the financial strain many Americans endure.  In 1962 s Capitalism and Freedom he argued that a negative income tax essentially a UBI would help overcome a mindset where citizens aren t inclined to make sacrifices if they don t believe others will follow suit. We might all of us be willing to contribute to the relief of poverty provided everyone else did he wrote.  Libertarian philosopher Charles Murray believes that guaranteed income would also cut government bureaucracy. He has proposed a 10000peryear UBI as well as basic health insurance which he says would allow the government to cut Social Security and other redistribution programs.  Universal basic income received considerable attention during the first stage of the 2020 presidential campaign after entrepreneur and former Democratic candidate Andrew Yang made the idea a cornerstone of his campaign. Yang s Freedom Dividend as he called it would give every American over the age of 18 a 1000 check every month. Those enrolled in federal assistance programs could continue to receive those payments or opt for the Freedom Dividend instead.  Yang contended that the labor force participation rate that is the percentage of Americans who were working or looking for work was at its lowest in decades. The Freedom Dividend would provide money to cover the basics for Americans while enabling us to look for a better job start our own business go back to school take care of our loved ones or work towards our next opportunity his campaign website noted.  Yang would later drop out of the presidential race. Though his proposal for a federal basic income has not been tested a number of local jurisdictions have experimented with UBI pilot projects. Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang s 1000amonth Freedom Dividend would have cost roughly 50 of the federal government s projected budget for 2021.  Pope Francis a staunch advocate of the disenfranchised has framed the issue in moral terms. In an Easter 2020 letter the pontiff wrote the following of a universal basic wage It would ensure and concretely achieve the ideal at once so human and so Christian of no worker without rights.   Despite its promise to curtail poverty and cut red tape universal basic income still faces an uphill battle. Perhaps the most glaring downside is cost. According to the nonprofit Tax Foundation Andrew Yang s 1000amonth Freedom Dividend for every adult would have cost 2.8 trillion each year minus any offsets from the consolidation of other programs.  Yang proposed covering that substantial expense in part by shrinking the size of other social programs and imposing a 10 valueadded tax VAT on businesses. He also proposed ending the cap on Social Security payroll taxes and putting in place a tax on carbon emissions that would contribute to his guaranteed income plan.  Whether that set of proposals would have been enough to fully offset the cost of a hypothetical Freedom Dividend remained in question however. An analysis by the Tax Foundation concluded that Yang s revenuegenerating ideas would only have covered about half its total impact on the Treasury.  Among the other criticisms of UBI is the argument that an income stream that s not reliant on employment would create a disincentive to work. That too has been a subject of debate. Yang has suggested that his plan to provide 12000 a year wouldn t be enough to live on. Therefore the vast majority of adults would need to supplement the payment with other income. There is no universal basic income program in the U.S. However across the country numerous localities and nonprofit organizations have implemented pilot projects to test the viability of UBI on a smallscale. According to the Basic Income Lab at Stanford University there have been 155 UBI experiments in the country with 67 of them currently active. A significant determining factor in the future feasibility of UBI is the matter of political support. According to a 2020 survey conducted by Pew Research Center a narrow majority of Americans oppose the concept of federal UBI. According to the survey Black and Hispanic adults lowerincome households and young adults were more likely to support the government providing UBI compared to White adults indiviuals over the age of 30 and upper and middleincome households. Proponents of UBI argue that such a policy if implemented would alleviate poverty and bolster income security with positive ripple effects on physical and mental health. Fiscally UBI may also represent a reduction in the cost of administering meanstested social safety net programs. Critics argue that UBI would be costly not only in its nominal price tag but also in its potential indirect costs including a reduction in a country s tax base and disincentives among recipients to seek and engage in work.  Universal basic income UBI proposes that the government give every adult citizen a set amount of money on a regular basis typically without conditions related to wealth or employment. The aims of such a system include reducing poverty and helping individuals meet basic needs. UBI proposals have been piloted in cities across the U.S. though they have been limited in scope. The idea of UBI has attracted significant attention since 2020 particularly given ongoing developments in artificial intelligence and automation. Thomas More. The Utopia. The Macmillan Company 1912.

Would a Universal Basic Income compromise that drive? The American safety net is not perfect not by a long shot but it does a good job of ensuring that lowincome Americans have enough support to meet their basic needs. The data are clear about that Consumption poverty which measures the wellbeing of the poor after accounting for safety net assistance provided by the government declined to an alltime low of 3 percent in 2016. Thanks to a good economy and strong public assistance programs very few Americans live in deprivation. Universal Basic Income UBI would be an unaffordable way to undermine our social safety net s successes. UBI would transfer money away from those who need it most change the distinctly American relationship between citizen and government and sharply raise taxes or the national debt or both. And critically it would fail to improve upon our current safety net s biggest weakness UBI would destroy not improve incentives to work. Universal Basic Income would transfer money away from those who need it most change the distinctly American relationship between citizen and government and sharply raise taxes or the national debt or both. The first problem is the money. A truly universal payment of 10000 to every citizen every year adds up to a new expense of about 3 trillion well more than we spend on our social safety net now and close to the entirety of the tax revenue currently collected by the federal government. Taylor Jo Isenberg Managing Director of the Economic Security Project provides an opposing view. Watch Forum on Leadership highlightIf any element of the current safety net is going to be preserved taxes will have to be raised dramatically beyond what is politically plausible or economically desirable or the U.S. would have to borrow even more money than we already do. Proponents of UBI should have to answer what social programs will be cut to make room for their proposal? Some of the money needed to pay for UBI would have to come from the middle and lowermiddle classes either in reduced benefits or increased taxes and they would then see some of their money transferred up to wealthier recipients of UBI. Money that would have been spent on programs for people in the lowest income quintiles would now be distributed universally including to the uppermost income quintiles. This does not sound much like an antipoverty program. Some of the money needed to pay for UBI would have to come from the middle and lowermiddle classes either in reduced benefits or increased taxes and they would then see some of their money transferred up to wealthier recipients of UBI. As for those not among the high earners UBI would surely illustrate a basic law of economics and negatively affect the incentive to work and produce. One thing I saw clearly in my 19 years of working in safety net programs in New York was that when benefits rose work and earnings declined. And in the major study of UBIlike programs provided in Seattle and Denver substantial unconditional payments were found to cause a near 14 percent decline in labor force participation and a 27 percent reduction in hours worked by women. That s a labor force dropoff greater than the difference between the highest participation rate we ve ever seen in this country and the lowest. That doesn t only mean people will be less driven than ever to earn their way out of poverty. Less work also means fewer feelings of citizenship and social inclusion worse mental health and feelings of wellbeing less happiness worse selfesteem even worse health among children more crime and way more drug abuse. The benefits of working are vast and welldocumented and antipoverty programs should encourage work not discourage it. UBI would also be an upheaval of the American relationship between citizen and state. American government was never meant to be a provider for all and citizens never meant to rely on publiclyfunded distributions. Under our Constitution government is enlisted to protect our freedoms not to provide for each and every citizen. In considering UBI we need to be conscious of what it means for an individual to be financially independent and how industrious independent individuals have been the drivers of American ingenuity and progress. Americans who grow dependent upon the generosity of the state become its wards and making them so will risk forfeiting what has made America the prosperous nation it is. There are other far more effective ways to improve incomes and outcomes for poor and workingclass Americans. Wage subsidies can ensure that working parents have more financial flexibility to support their families.

If we are worried about the automation revolution making current jobs obsolete we should focus on teaching soft skills and technological skills to lowskill workers and to people who do not attend college. Career and technical education provides many opportunities to prepare for a future in which understanding new technologies will be a paramount skill and public policymakers could focus on ensuring that lowincome people are properly supported as they gain the knowledge necessary to enter or reenter the workforce. The bottom line is that UBI gives up on work with all the positive secondary effects work brings in favor of an unaffordable overhaul of our current social safety net programs. We are not and should not be prepared to sacrifice our longstanding commitment to adapting to new circumstances and equipping people with new skills for a new economy. Without answers as to how we can pay for UBI how it can avoid the pitfalls of a further shrinking labor force and how we can maintain our distinctly American freedom the UBI is a risk we cannot take. The bottom line is that UBI gives up on work with all the positive secondary effects work brings in favor of an unaffordable overhaul of our current social safety net programs.
