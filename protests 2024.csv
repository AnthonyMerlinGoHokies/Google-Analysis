By Kathryn Palmer You have 5 articles left.Sign up for a free account or log in. UCLA students march through the campus on November 10 2016 to protest Donald Trump s victory in the presidential elections. College leaders are anxious about how to handle possible protests related to the 2024 presidential election. As the chaos of campus protests over the IsraelHamas war reaches a fever pitch the Constructive Dialogue Institute has released a guide to help higher education leaders manage their campus climates in preparation for the 2024 election season. Being proactive applying existing strategies and infrastructure to mitigate future electionrelated protests and involving a wide range of stakeholders in the process were among the key suggestions from the institute which helps institutions and organizations foster communication across differences and build inclusive cultures.  No event is as effective at shunting communities into us versus them as a U.S. presidential election said the institutes guide Maintaining Campus Community During the 2024 Election which the organization released last week. The 2024 election adds a unique challenge because higher education itself is on the ballot.  Most PopularSince the war began on Oct. 7 campus administrators have faced criticism from state and federal lawmakers donors students and faculty about how they ve handled local responses to the Middle Eastern conflict. And according to various campus climate surveys many proPalestine and proIsrael students alike feel unsafe. All of that turmoil in addition to the continued conservative crusade against diversity equity and inclusion programs and frustrations about student debt has pushed higher education issues to the forefront of the political discourse shaping November s presidential race between former President Donald Trump and President Joe Biden.  Although political polarization is a standard feature of any election season a cohort of 10 college and university presidents CDI interviewed last August expressed anxiety about the upcoming election said Mary Aviles insights and experience lead at CDI and coauthor of the guide. They were anticipating anxiety related to the outcome polarization in terms of discussions and activities and in some cases outright hostility.  Helping campus leaders address those concerns inspired CDI to spend much of this academic year creating a guide for the 2024 election. Aviles and her team reviewed the available literature on campus climates during past elections. They also interviewed 21 college presidents administrators faculty and staff who by that point were fully entrenched in trying to manage warrelated campus protests. When asked about their previous experience managing fallout from an election the majority of campus leaders focused on the 2016 faceoff between Trump and Hillary Clinton. The guide notes that the pandemic shut down inperson learning at most campuses during the 2020 election so protests weren t as common that year. In the days after Trump s election in 2016 campuses across the country reported heightened tension protests and racist incidences. College leaders felt caught off guard and because of that they didn t think they d be caught off guard in the same way this time Aviles said. But they didn t feel like they could do a good job of supporting people after the election. They just weren t prepared for the emotional reaction people had especially those from marginalized communities. They wanted to do better this time.  Preparing for aftercare following the election or an electionrelated protest is one of the recommendations CDI outlined in its guide.   They re learning a lot about their conflict environment right now Aviles said. They already have existing infrastructure that they re using in current crises that they can apply to the election.  Ohio Northern University offers one example of how this could work. The university already uses EdSights an AIpowered text messaging service to periodically check in on students mental health. It analyzes responses and connects students with resources accordingly.   Consider supplementing these existing practices to also evaluate the election s impact possibly adjusting the outreach frequency as November approaches the guide suggests. Analyzing preelection checkin results could inform priority postelection aftercare.  A partnership between LinnBenton Community College and neighboring Oregon State University offers a lowtech example. Earlier this year the two institutions collaborated to host an event focused on restoring civic dialogue featuring Robert George a conservative legal scholar and Cornel West a liberal philosopher. More than 1000 people attended and participants enthusiastic response underscored a palpable demand for more such intellectually enriching occasions according to the guide.  Many campuses already do some issuebased education and dialogue on campus Aviles said. They can repurpose those same structures and activities to deal with electionspecific issues.  Although the details of those strategies may vary CDI suggests all leaders take a proactive approach to getting a plan in place before November 2024. Figuring all of that out now and making campus policies clear may help prevent or mitigate the campus clashes that have resulted in arrests suspensions and expulsions of numerous student activists in the recent days weeks and months.  If you wait until what we re experiencing now which is upheaval then you re automatically on a responsive footing Aviles said. Enforcement in the face of an active crisis can be perceived as very abrupt escalation. Whereas if you have the luxury of addressing things more proactively you have time to include the community and do a more thorough job of making the community aware of the policies.  To maximize the power of developing a proactive approach to the 2024 election CBI s guide notes that while leadership is key to organizing a collaborative process both topdown and bottomup approaches are necessary for cultivating positive campus climates.  And just as campus protests over the IsraelHamas war have tasked college administrators with balancing campus safety and free speech the election will likely require the same considerations.  The only answer is for colleges to protect speech punish violence ensure more than adequate security and act swiftly to separate groups when tension flares Will Creeley legal director for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression said in a statement Monday following days of unrest at Columbia and Yale universities.  There cannot be any sense whatsoever that violence will be tolerated. Campuses can meet all of those objectives indeed must to preserve stability and defend truly protected speech amidst intense pressure.  To help ease homesickness some colleges have adopted petfriendly policies for students living on and offcampus.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/24/columbia-pro-palestine-protesters-face-deadline-to-clear-out-whats-next,  We are making important progress with representatives of the student encampment on the West lawn Columbia said in a statement released just after 3am 0700 GMT on Wednesday. The university had earlier given students a midnight deadline to dismantle tents if negotiations failed to deliver an agreement. That was initially extended to 8am 1200 GMT on Wednesday. University President Nemat Minouche Shafik had said the university will have to consider alternative options for clearing the area if talks did not yield an end to the encampments. In its latest statement the university again extended the deadline this time by 48 hours into early on Friday and said student protesters had agreed to four of the university s top demands. But several hours after the statement key student bodies behind the proPalestinian protests had not commented on those demands. ProPalestine protests have roiled university campuses in the United States from coast to coast. But Columbia has been the heart of the solidarity movement as the Gaza death toll spirals to more than 34000 people mainly children and women killed since the conflict erupted on October 7. And nationwide those studentled protests show no sign of easing up despite arrests and suspensions. Columbia University said in its early morning statement that student protesters had agreed to After the deadline was initially extended to 8am students who had taken down tents put them back up and largely returned to the encampment Caroline Anne Bissonnette a journalism student who has been covering the protests since the first day told Al Jazeera. The protesters are demanding that the university divest from corporations that profit from Israel s war on Gaza which entered its 200th day on Tuesday. Additional demands include more financial transparency about Columbia s investments and the severing of academic ties and collaborations with Israeli universities and programmes. The demonstrators are additionally demanding a complete ceasefire in Gaza. About 135am 0535 GMT on Wednesday Columbia University s student radio station WKCR citing sources on and off campus reported that 50 police officers from the force s Strategic Response Group SRG were lined up outside campus at 116th Street in New York City. A student reporter told WKCR that the police response was more severe than we have seen before and the SRG officers were wearing face masks and helmets and had zip ties as they faced protesters on the pavement. The radio station clarified that there was no indication that police were mobilising inside the campus. Police had earlier warned the protesters off campus that if they used amplified sound they would be arrested WKCR reported adding that the protests continued with booming sounds including drums horns and chants. On Monday the university announced that classes would be held in hybrid mode until the end of the spring semester. Columbia is now facing an academic boycott after more than 1400 academics around the world signed a letter saying they will not participate in academic and cultural events at the university and its affiliate Barnard College until suspensions of student protesters in recent days are reversed police are removed from the campus and Shafik resigns. The movement is organised by the Columbia University Apartheid Divest CUAD coalition of student organisations Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace. In a statement posted on X CUAD said on Wednesday that its team had left the negotiations with the university and would not engage further until there is a written commitment that the administration will not be unleashing the NYPD New York Police Department or the National Guard on its students . It reiterated that civilians including large numbers of women and children have been killed in Gaza and every university in the besieged enclave has been destroyed.  We refuse to concede to cowardly threats and blatant intimidation by university administration. We will continue to peacefully protest it said. PRESS RELEASE Columbia University Threatens Students with the National Guard After Refusing to Bargain in Good Faith.  We refuse to concede to cowardly threats and blatant intimidation by university administration. We will continue to peacefully protest. cu4palestine pic.twitter.comIqAlXwyeHN  Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine ColumbiaSJP April 24 2024  In an email to the student body Shafik wrote that if the negotiations between Columbia s administration and the student organisers did not end in dismantling the encampment dispersing and following university policies then the university would consider alternative options to clear the encampment.  I also want to be clear that we will not tolerate intimidating harassing or discriminatory behaviour she warned adding that the right to protest is essential and protected at Columbia but harassment and discrimination is antithetical to our values and an affront to our commitment to be a community of mutual respect and kindness.  CUAD said in a statement at 1230am 0430 GMT on Wednesday that the university had threatened negotiators to call in both the national guard and police if we do not acquiesce to their demands . On April 18 more than 100 proPalestinian protesters were arrested on campus on charges of trespassing. Several students were also suspended from Columbia and Barnard including Isra Hirsi the daughter of Ilhan Omar a Democrat in the US House of Representatives. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson announced that he will visit Columbia on Wednesday to meet Jewish students. In a post on X he wrote that Jewish students do not feel safe on campus. Let s be clear these are not peaceful protests these are antisemitic mobs he wrote. Amid antiIsrael protests Jewish students at Columbia University don t feel safe. It s become so dangerous that students were forced out of the classroom.  Let s be clear these are not peaceful protests these are antisemitic mobs. pic.twitter.commHwOOireTJ  Speaker Mike Johnson SpeakerJohnson April 23 2024  Delegations of Republican and Democratic members of Congress also visited the university s lockeddown campus on Monday to express concern for the security of Jewish students.
https://ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/education/2024/04/24/us-campus-universities-protest-palestine-israel, Get the best experience and stay connected to your community with our Spectrum News app. Learn More  Continue in Browser  Dozens of colleges and universities across the U.S. have seen protests erupt in the last few days to call for an end to what students and faculty have described as a genocide of Palestinians by Israel amid the war in Gaza that has left 34000 Palestinians dead millions displaced and hundreds of thousands in danger of famine.  Palestinian and Jewish liberation is intertwined. And go hand by hand said Mahmoud Khalil a Palestinian student at Columbia University in New York City and negotiator for protesters at a Tuesday press conference for students who have been arrested and suspended. Khalil was not suspended himself avoiding the worst of the protests over fear of losing his visa status but thanked his fellow students for protesting on our behalf.   Columbia has not acknowledged this pain the pain of the Palestinian community at Columbia that is calling for the end of the genocide in Gaza he added Hundreds of students in the U.S. have been arrested virtually all for trespass an examination of media reports and police statements shows. Over 100 were arrested at Columbia University last week the New York Police Department said. On Tuesday night Columbia University President Minouche Shafik gave students camped out on campus a midnight deadline to reach an agreement with the administration and disperse. Another 47 students and 13 others were arrested at Yale University early Monday morning when police raided an encampment set up by protesters at the center of campus. At New York University around 120 students faculty members and other protesters were arrested by police and herded onto correction buses on Monday night 116 of whom were released with summonses for criminal trespass and another four who were charged with trespass resisting arrest and obstructing governmental administration the NYPD said.  Helga TawilSouri a PalestinianAmerican professor at NYU said on the leftwing news show Democracy Now! that faculty there formed a protective barrier around the students camped out in a plaza matching news reports of the protest. When the NYPD arrived it was those faculty who were first arrested.   The police force kind of forced their way into the sort of plaza where the students were where the students had their tents set up and extremely violently kind of took down all the tents were throwing chairs around and arrested all the students that were there TawilSouri said. Were told that oh the disruption was part of the protest right and the chanting and the singing but you know its New York City its really loud there was construction right across the street. So its really hard for me to understand that that was the sort of disruption.  NYU said in a statement they were concerned nonNYU students joining the protest could lead to individuals getting hurt so they called in the NYPD who said water bottles and a chair were thrown at them. The NYPD used mace on protesters and journalists alike as they arrested 120 people. No one arrested was charged with a violent crime.  TawilSouri noted that many protesters were Jewish and said the police moved in during Muslim evening prayers.  The students feel very sort of spirited in the sense of they want to kind of continue she said. For them its about okay fine you took us down but were gonna continue. We have the right to protest we have the right to academic speech we have the right to free speech and we have the right to stand up for our proPalestinian voices.  Outrage over the protests has stemmed from videos on social media of antisemitic rhetoric coming from some protesters but organizers have pushed back on those characterizations blaming individuals spreading bigotry as not representative of the larger movement. The protests at Columbia NYU and elsewhere were participated in and helped organized by Jewish groups and students. On Monday student protesters camped on Columbia University s campus held a Passover seder.  I asked the White House Jewish members of Congress and all those who speak on behalf of Jewish safety and the Jewish people to listen and hear our message said Soph Askanese at the Columbia University and Barnard College students press conference on Tuesday. Askanese said they were arrested for trespassing and suspended from campus indefinitely. Come see our camp. Come to a Shabbat come break bread with us or this week break some matzah.  On Tuesday the proPalestinian organization Jewish Voice for Peace said in a statement they were planning a major disruption and civil disobedience that had the goal of the mass arrest of Jews outside the New York home of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer DN.Y. Many were arrested according to local journalists. The campus protests beginning with the national newsmaking encampment erected at Columbia University have drawn denouncements from President Joe Biden former President Donald Trump billionaires congressional leaders and dozens of lawmakers in Washington and beyond from both parties. Two Republican senators from other states and AntiDefamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt called for the National Guard to be sent into Columbia University s New York City campus to rein in the largely peaceful protests. Speaker Mike Johnson RLa. planned to hold a press conference at Columbia University on Wednesday to denounce the protests. The increase in protest activity on campuses has coincided with Johnson s ushering through Congress of a foreign aid package that included 26 billion in U.S. military aid for Israel s war effort. The Senate approved it on Tuesday night and sent it to Biden s desk. The protests also come as Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu has pledged a ground offensive in Rafah a city in southern Gaza where the vast majority of the enclave s population has fled. Strikes there over the weekend killed 22 people including 18 children. And on Tuesday the U.N. reported the discovery of mass graves near two hospitals in Gaza with hundreds of bodies including some who were found with their hands tied and stripped of their clothes. The U.N. human rights chief said if verified the mass graves would amount to war crimes.  On Monday night at California State Polytechnic University Humboldt in northern California protesters occupied a building and physically clashed with police armed with riot shields and batons which were used to batter the protesters as they shoved back and wielded an empty water jug according to video footage published by a local journalist. Three were arrested the university said. The protesters remained barricaded in the building as of Tuesday afternoon according to an Instagram post from local organizers and reporting from the local TimesStandard newspaper. More arrests were made at the University of MinnesotaTwin Cities on Tuesday after police tore down an encampment on campus according to activists there. Hundreds rallied to the Minnesota campus in the afternoon to demand their release which they were later in the day. Encampments popped up at U.C. Berkeley the University of Pittsburgh the University of Rochester the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Emerson College Tufts University the New School University of Michigan the University of New Mexico and others according to activists local media reports and student news outlets.  Some of the protests have led to universities moving classes online as the end of the spring semester nears. Harvard University suspended a proPalestinian group and restricted access to Harvard Yard after a rally on Friday. The protests are in solidarity with the Palestinian people with many calling on their institutions to end investments into weapons manufacturers Israeli companies as well as calling for an end of the conflict and denouncing what protesters describe as a genocide.  We refuse to accept the mass slaughter of Palestinians as normal or acceptable Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in a statement on Monday. As elected officials and media outlets weaponize the concept of campus safety remember that there are no universities left in Gaza.  Last week the U.N. decried the systematic destruction of the Palestinian education system in Gaza reporting 5800 students and teachers had been killed. Over 80 of schools in Gaza were damaged or destroyed U.N. experts said.  It may be reasonable to ask if there is an intentional effort to comprehensively destroy the Palestinian education system an action known as scholasticide the experts said. Israa University the last remaining university in Gaza was demolished by the Israeli military on 17 January 2024.  In March former U.S. Ambassador to Algeria and Syria Robert Ford who served under five presidents told Spectrum News the destruction of universities in Gaza could be evidence of targeting Palestinians cultural identity making it easier to argue that it is a genocide. 
https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2024/04/24/columbia-university-student-protests-palestine-israel-news/, The university has been in talks with student organizers behind protests against the IsraelGaza war part of a wave of demonstrations at colleges across the country that have led to a spate of arrests to clear an encampment on the West Lawn of Columbia s Morningside Heights campus. If the discussions are not successful Columbia President Minouche Shafik warned Tuesday in a statement Columbia will have to consider alternative options for clearing the West Lawn and restoring calm to campus.  Mahmoud Khalil a Columbia student who is part of the negotiations with the administration said he was not aware of any police presence on the campus after the initial deadline at midnight Tuesday expired. In a statement provided to The Washington Post Columbia said it was extending the deadline by 48 hours in light of important progress that had been made with the organizers. The student protesters agreed to dismantle and remove a significant number of tents committed to ensuring that only Columbia students will participate in the demonstrations and have taken steps to ensure no discriminatory or harassing language is used at the encampment according to the statement. Shortly after midnight Columbia student negotiators had released a statement alleging that the university administration had threatened to call the National Guard and the New York police if its demands were not met. The university did not comment on the allegations. The protests continue to garner attention nationally as incidents spread across the country. On Wednesday afternoon House Speaker Mike Johnson RLa. will visit the Columbia campus and call on Shafik to resign he said in an interview on The Hugh Hewitt Show Wednesday morning. He added that he would also meet with Jewish students and a rabbi on campus. New York Gov. Kathy Hochul D said Tuesday that she had no plans to call in the National Guard in response to the campus protesters according to local media. Her office did not immediately respond to queries about whether Columbia had made such a request. More than 100 people protesting the war in Gaza were arrested and charged with trespassing at Columbia last week after Shafik summoned police to the campus in what she described as an extraordinary step to keep the campus safe. The move to call the police and suspend protesting students was criticized by student leaders and human rights groups. Tensions over the war in Gaza now in its seventh month have swept across American campuses as universities struggle to balance the right to protest and freedom of speech with campus rules and safety. ProPalestinian protests at colleges have demanded that their universities divest from corporations doing business with Israel or profiting off the war in Gaza. At Columbia protesters have also asked the university to end a dualdegree program with Tel Aviv University. University administrators have also faced intense scrutiny from Congress. The Republicanled House Committee on Education and the Workforce has grilled Shafik and the leaders of other universities over actions taken to combat antisemitism on campus.
https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/columbia-yale-protests-passover-04-22-24/index.html, Live Live Our live coverage has ended. Follow the latest news or read through the updates below.  The Massachusetts Institute of Technology issued a statement Monday regarding tents on its campus. Robert Kraft billionaire owner of the NFL s New England Patriots and backer of Columbia University on Monday said he is still willing to support The Kraft Center at the school that supports Jewish students calling it a haven of safety.  Kraft an alumnus of the university told CNN s Jake Tapper on The Lead that he loves the school and we have to have accountability.   There are both professors and students within the university who say things that I think cross the line and there should be accountability. I believe in free speech. Say whatever you want but pay the consequences. And dont have your face covered. I dont think that should be allowed he said.   I can t believe in New York City at Columbia University Jewish students are afraid to go to classes in the United States of America in 2024. It s amazing to me and horrible Kraft also said. Asked where he drew the line at Columbia University regarding both proPalestine and proIsrael protests and what he finds objectionable he said there is a lack of education on the situation happening in the Middle East.   I m concerned about America and what s going on in this country. And to keep it open and free for all people of all backgrounds to do as they wish he said. Asked if he has confidence in Columbia University s president Minouche Shafik he said he thinks she is very well intentioned and said we have to look at what goes on with faculty.  Hundreds of people gathered on Low Plaza Monday afternoon as Columbia University faculty delivered speeches in support of the student protesters who were suspended and arrested Thursday. Faculty who spoke denounced university president Minouche Shafik s decision to authorize the New York Police Department to remove protesters from campus and demanded all legal and disciplinary charges be dismissed and expunged from students records. Faculty held signs that read Hands off our students and End student suspensions now. Some faculty donned their academic regalia and wore sashes that read We support students.  Speeches were met with cheers and claps from the crowd as well as chants for Shafik to resign. Christopher Brown a professor of history said I m here because I am so concerned about what is happening at this university with where we are now and with where we are going. Thursday April 18 2024 will be remembered as a shameful day in Columbia history.   The president s decision to send riot police to pick up peaceful protesters on our campus was unprecedented unjustified disproportionate divisive and dangerous Brown said. US Rep. Ilhan Omar whose daughter Isra Hirsi was among the protesters arrested Thursday posted on X that while she s glad to see faculty demonstrate in solidarity with students she wants the protests to focus on Gaza. On Thursday Columbia arrested and suspended its students who were peacefully protesting and have now ignited a nationwide Gaza Solidarity movement. This is more than the students hoped for and I am glad to see this type of solidarity. But to be clear this about the genocide in Gaza and the attention has to remain on that Omar wrote. New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Monday condemned vile and disgusting rhetoric being used at campuses such as Columbia University where students are holding protests over the IsraelHamas War. Adams told CNN s Jake Tapper that he supports First Amendment rights but said law enforcement officials are on the ready if any of that speech goes too far or if there s an imminent threat to people or property. That is one of the fundamental rights we hold dear as Americans The right to protest Adams said on CNNs The Lead. What we have seen playing out on many of our college campuses and particularly Columbia University is hate. We re seeing vile language being used. Adams noted that he can feel the duality of this moment and how the events of the past six months are weighing heavily on Jewish and Palestinian New Yorkers. He added that the police escorts of Jewish students through campus were reminiscent of the Army soldiers who escorted nine Black students into a high school in Little Rock Arkansas nearly 67 years ago. New York Police Department officers have a large presence surrounding Columbia but have remained off the campus grounds at the request of the school s administration NYPD deputy commissioners said earlier on Monday. Adams told Tapper that the NYPD s commissioner of legal matter is monitoring the protests for any speech that violates law. Additionally police officers will take appropriate action and go on private property if there s an imminent threat. Protesters have gathered at The New School located near the Chelsea area of the New York City borough of Manhattan. An encampment of four tents was set up in the lobby of the building that houses auditoriums a cafeteria and a library. Roughly 75 students and other people who have The New School IDs gathered inside the building.  Disclose divest we will not stop we will not stop we will not rest was repeatedly chanted.  Outside the building protesters from the school as well as outsiders joined in chants from the sidewalk.  There s a stark difference between the inside of Columbia Universitys campus and the outside where there are protesters gathered on the street.  The encampment is only open to those affiliated with campus. Only those with a Columbia ID can enter the campus gates. Inside the encampment programs include teachins poetry readings and film screenings. Some students are quietly finishing assignments while others are painting posters.  Elsewhere around campus students are eating and completing assignments. Many students take graduation pictures at this time and some are in graduation gowns walking down Broadway. Risers are set up for an upcoming commencement ceremony. Other students are holding large American flags underneath Butler Library.  But the students can still hear the tension that is taking place yards away at the university gates. There is a gathering of proPalestinian protesters who in the early afternoon were chanting I believe that we will win and Long Live the Intifada. There was a smaller group of proIsraeli protesters who chanted back Down with Hamas and Victory to Israel. A line of New York Police officers were monitoring the street. The inside of the encampment is quiet most of the noise comes from protestors outside the gates of Columbia Universitys campus who are chanting I believe that we will win and Long live the Intifada. It was a sunny day on campus and in one corner students were painting posters. One person strummed a stringed instrument and other students are reading books or on their laptops finishing assignments. Others have donated provisions ranging from a table of snacks to hygiene products. There was also a pile of blankets.  We ve just been trying to keep students mobilized and keep pushing for divestment Dalia a firstyear student at Columbia College told CNN. We are a very mobilized student body and a very unified student body. Hundreds of people have been in and out of the encampment.  CNN agreed not to publish her surname due to safety concerns. She said the students at the campus refuse to be complicit in the genocide the apartheid and the occupation of Palestine.  There are strict community guidelines for the encampment. One rule says not to share names or details of anyone met in camp and asking for permission before photographing or taking video. The encampment is filled with dozens and dozens of tents from students to neighboring Barnard College staff. Today s encampment program included an Earth Day performance poetry reading and a Dabka lesson a traditional dance from the Arab region. Prior program events included dance performances from different cultures.  Democratic Reps. Jared Moskowitz of Florida Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey Dan Goldman of New York and Kathy Manning of North Carolina who are all Jewish spoke at a news conference Monday after touring Columbia University s campus.  We saw it firsthand as we walked past the encampments on the universitys main lawn full of protesters spewing incendiary antisemitic hate and vitriol. Many arent even Columbia students Ive been told. Their campaign of intimidation is sickening and shocking and as the White House said yesterday echoes the rhetoric of Hamas terrorists Gottheimer said.  He also criticized Columbia University leadership saying toothless combinations from administrators arent going to stop the anarchy we re seeing.   The only way to do it is with deeds not words Gottheimer said. Colleges have a legal obligation under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act to provide students including Jews and Muslims a school environment free from discrimination and harassment based on race color or national origin. Yet just feet from here Jewish students are being verbally and even physically assaulted.  Gottheimer continued To the administrators of Columbia and beyond here are our demands Stop the double talk and start acting now. Discipline harassers restore civility on this campus encourage peaceful constructive dialogue.  He also gave a message for students While the leadership of Columbia may be failing you we will not. We will do everything in our power to keep you safe and do everything in Washington we can to make sure that you feel welcome at this university or any university across the United States of America. And Columbia University if they dont follow through will pay the price.  Goldman said he was encouraged the Columbia University president issued guidelines about additional security calling it a very important first step and criticized what is happening on campus. That is unacceptable for a university that is unacceptable for an academic institution. There is no question that everyone has a First Amendment right to speak out in this country and that must be preserved Goldman said. But a university and all universities have an obligation to maintain the safety and security of their students from all backgrounds. Manning said university leadership should do more to keep Jewish students safe and to reestablish an atmosphere in which all students can learn study and participate safely in campus life. Columbia must also move forward with its promised efforts to teach its students and its faculty about the nature and history and dangers of antisemitism. It must ensure that Columbia professors are not encouraging and spreading antisemitism Manning said. I call on the US Department of Education and the US Department of Justice to work with the White House to ensure that all universities take steps necessary to keep Jewish students and faculty safe. I also call on Congress to enact legislation to implement the steps outlined in the US national strategy to counter antisemitism to address the scourge of antisemitism which is a threat to the foundations of our democracy she said. President Joe Biden decried antisemitic protests around college campuses Monday and said his administration was working to combat antiJewish hatred. I condemn the antisemitic protests that s why I ve set up a program to deal with that Biden said when questioned about the events at Columbia University in New York. I also condemn those who don t understand what s going on with the Palestinians he said without expanding upon what he meant. Biden was speaking after an Earth Day event in Prince William Forest Park in Triangle Virginia. When asked whether Columbias president should resign Biden appeared to mishear I didn t know that. Ill have to find out more he said.
https://www.browndailyherald.com/article/2024/04/adoch-2024-sees-over-1000-prospective-students-multiple-student-protests, A swath of admitted students paraded Brown s campus during A Day on College Hill last Friday. The annual event was hosted twice April 12 and April 19 and saw a turnout of over 1000 students according to a University press release.   Admitted students came from 42 states and 27 countries Dean of Undergraduate Admission Logan Powell wrote in an email to The Herald. Some to reaffirm their commitment to Brown and others to visit for the first time to learn more about life on College Hill.  Registration opened at 800 a.m. with events and festivities throughout the day. Many students found Speed Friending a chance to quickly meet other students to be a highlight I thought it would be a lot more awkward Kieran Lamay said. But everyone was super friendly.  For most ADOCH presented an opportunity to connect with future classmates. The event was a good way to get to know people Averie Masia said. A lot of people were passing their phones around and exchanging Instagram usernames.  The ADOCH itinerary featured various panels tours and open houses. Additionally there were extracurricular showcases including performances from a capella groups and the Brown University Band as well as the FashionBrown Spring Fair. Come lunchtime local food trucks lined up outside the Main Green. Luca Gwathmey described these offerings as tasty but expressed wariness I assume they re wooing us over with the food. I don t know if it compares to cafeteria food but it s alright.  For Gwathmey balancing independence and structure will be a big part of his college experience. He embarked on a gap year after deferring his admission and is excited to carve his own path with the Open Curriculum. The Open Curriculum was a selling point for most students especially for those unsure of what they want to pursue. Going into my application season I really didn t know what I wanted to do James Yan said. Brown gives me the opportunity to explore.  The second day of ADOCH saw blue skies and sun a welcomed improvement from the dreary weekend prior. Faith Park had visited Brown s campus twice before during winter and confessed that the gloom didn t sell Brown as the bestlooking campus.   Now that I m visiting again in spring it s really nice she added.   I feel like tourists just take pictures of this building the Bostonbased Lamay joked as he pointed at Sayles Hall noting that Providence was a bit generic.  Max BeanTierney thought otherwise adding that they actually like Providence. . The incoming class expressed ageold qualms concerns about cafeteria food shopping for classes roommates climbing up College Hill and the transition from high school to college. I m just waiting for imposter syndrome to kick in Serena Lombardi joked.   Transitions are always a little bit tricky but I think Brown is a very inviting community Masia said.That makes me a little less nervous.  The enthusiasm was palpable as students chattered across campus eager to gain their bearings and make new friends. I m really excited to meet people I love hearing about what others are passionate about Nat Konwicz said. And I get the vibe that Brown is a bunch of passionate people.  Like last year simultaneous student demonstrations sprung up throughout ADOCH. As reported by The Herald there was a student installation by Brown Students for Israel and a proPalestine protest by the Brown Divest Coalition and Jews for Ceasefire Now.  The former comprised two long dinner tables on the Quiet Green attached to each seat was a picture of one of the 130 hostages currently being held in Gaza.  The latter was attended by around 100 students who had gathered to support the 113 proPalestine students that were arrested at Columbia University. The hourlong protest began at noon and occurred along the intersection of George and Brown Streets.  In a statement to The Herald BDC said that incoming students ought to be aware of the true history of Brown s response to student activism.  The Admissions Office did not respond to a request for comment. Brown admitted 5.2 of its application pool to the class of 2028 The Herald previously reported. This class will be the last to have applied under a testoptional policy as standardized tests become mandatory next application season. Prospective students have until May 1 to confirm their offer.

https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/21/us/columbia-university-jewish-students-protests/index.html,  Columbia University is facing a fullblown crisis heading into Passover as a rabbi linked to the Ivy League school urged Jewish students to stay home and tense confrontations on campus sparked condemnation from the White House and New York officials.   The atmosphere is so charged that Columbia officials announced students can attend classes and even possibly take exams virtually starting Monday the first day of Passover a major Jewish holiday set to begin in the evening.   Tensions at Columbia and many universities have been high ever since the October 7 terror attack on Israel by Hamas. However the situation at Columbia escalated in recent days after university officials testified before Congress last week about antisemitism on campus and proPalestinian protests on and near campus surged.   The latest crisis has opened Columbia President Minouche Shafik up to new attacks from her critics with Republican US Rep. Elise Stefanik demanding she step down immediately because school leadership has clearly lost control of its campus.   Rep. Virginia Foxx the Republican chair of the House Education Committee sent a letter on Sunday to university leaders warning them of consequences if they do not rein in protests on campus.   Columbia s continued failure to restore order and safety promptly to campus constitutes a major breach of the University s Title VI obligations upon which federal financial assistance is contingent and which must immediately be rectified Foxx wrote.   Underscoring concerns about student safety Rabbi Elie Buechler a rabbi associated with Columbia University s Orthodox Union Jewish Learning Initiative on Campus confirmed to CNN s Jake Tapper on Sunday that he sent a WhatsApp message to a group of about 300 mostly Orthodox Jewish students strongly recommending they return home and remain there.   In his message Buechler wrote that recent events at the university have made it clear that Columbia University s Public Safety and the NYPD cannot guarantee Jewish students safety.   It deeply pains me to say that I would strongly recommend you return home as soon as possible and remain home until the reality in and around campus has dramatically improved the message reads.   NYPD officers detain a person as proPalestinian protesters gather outside of Columbia University in New York City on April 18 2024. Officers cleared out a proPalestinian campus demonstration on April 18 a day after university officials testified about antiSemitism before Congress. Leaders of Columbia University defended the prestigious New York schools efforts to combat antiSemitism on campus at a fiery congressional hearing on April 17.

While every American has the right to peaceful protest calls for violence and physical intimidation targeting Jewish students and the Jewish community are blatantly antisemitic unconscionable and dangerous White House spokesperson Andrew Bates said in a statement shared with CNN on Sunday. The statement did not include examples of those incidents.   President Joe Biden similarly said Sunday Even in recent days we ve seen harassment and calls for violence against Jews. T his blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous and it has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere in our country.   In response organizers of the protest Columbia University Apartheid Divest and Columbia Students for Justice in Palestine said in a statement We have been peaceful and distanced themselves from nonstudent protestors who have gathered outside the campus calling them inflammatory individuals who do not represent us.   We firmly reject any form of hate or bigotry and stand vigilant against nonstudents attempting to disrupt the solidarity being forged among students Palestinian Muslim Arab Jewish Black and proPalestinian classmates and colleagues who represent the full diversity of our country the activists statement continued.   New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said on X that threatening Jewish students with violence is antisemitism. The First Amendment protects the right to protest but students also have a right to learn in an environment free from harassment or violence the Democratic governor said.   In a statement New York Mayor Eric Adams said the city s police department has an increased presence of officers in the area around Columbia s campus to protect students and all New Yorkers on nearby public streets.   The Democratic mayor said he was horrified and disgusted with the antisemitism being spewed at and around the Columbia University campus.   In a Sunday statement to CNN a university spokesperson said the safety of Columbia s community is our number one priority.   The statement added We are acting on concerns we are hearing from our Jewish student s and are providing additional support and resources to ensure that our community remains safe.   While Buechler called for Jewish students to stay home the campus Hillel said in a Sunday post on X that they do not believe that Jewish students should leave the campus.   This is a time of genuine discomfort and even fear for many of us on campus the Hillel said in a statement. Columbia University and the City of New York must do more to protect students. We call on the University Administration to act immediately in restoring calm to campus. The City must ensure that students can walk up and down Broadway and Amsterdam without fear of harassment.   Throughout Passover there will be a police presence at the Kraft Center a Jewish cultural center shared by Columbia and Barnard and campus public safety will provide walking escorts to and from the building starting Monday according to an email from Brian Cohen the center s executive director.   Chabad a Jewish organization the University said on Facebook they ve hired additional security to protect students during Passover. They said they were horrified by what we witnessed last night on and near Columbia s campus but still planned to host Passover celebrations on campus.   The rabbi sent the message after videos circulated showing a man outside the university saying Never forget the seventh of October and that will happen not one more time not five more times not 10 more times not 100 more times not 1000 more times but 10000 times!   A video taken on the university s campus Saturday night also shows a small group of proPalestinian demonstrators chanting Fk Israel. Israel is a btch while waving the Palestinian flag.   In addition to the student protests on campus groups of protesters have also gathered outside the campus gates. It s unclear from the video whether the person yelling is affiliated with the university.   Columbia University Apartheid Divest addressed the unassociated incidents in an Instagram story writing that their priority is the safety of all which includes not antagonizing counter protestors or escalating situations unnecessarily.   The encampment began the same day Columbia s president Minouche Shafik testified before Congress about antisemitism on campus.   video Related video They are not supposed to be attacked Life and death as a journalist in Gaza   Speaking with CNN one Jewish Columbia student highlighted the hazards risked by the students protesting as well as interfaith prayers and a Seder service at the encampment.   Columbia students organizing in solidarity with Palestine including Jewish students have faced harassment doxxing and now arrest by the NYPD. These are the main threats to the safety of Jewish Columbia students Jonathan BenMenachem a PhD student told CNN.   On the other hand student protesters have led interfaith joint prayers for several days now and Passover Seder will be held at the Gaza Solidarity Encampment tomorrow he went on. Saying that student protesters are a threat to Jewish students is a dangerous smear.   Another student Noah Lederman told CNN he was terrified angry upset and horrified that the university failed to take action. Lederman said he had been accosted in early February and had asked the university for remote learning options. What s happening on campus is blatantly antisemitic he added.   Students will be permitted to attend classes virtually due to the ongoing demonstrations a university spokesperson told CNN on Sunday.   Sunday marked a fifth day of demonstrations at the prestigious school with students camping out overnight on the school s lawns.   Columbia s Campus Rabbi Yonah Hain shared a statement with CNN saying the university s Center for Jewish Student Life is and will remain open and is welcoming students.   On Thursday the university s president requested the NYPD remove student protestors leading to the arrest of over 100 people. The students that were arrested were peaceful offered no resistance whatsoever and were saying what they wanted to say in a peaceful manner said NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell.   Obtained by CNN video Related video My darling! Loved ones cry out for young girl killed in airstrike   CNN has reached out to Columbia University and the university s Advisory Committee on Socially Responsible Investing for more information on their investments and for comment on the protest organizers allegations.   The encampment was jointly organized by Columbia University Apartheid Divest a studentled coalition of more than 100 organizations Students for Justice in Palestine and Jewish Voice for Peace to protest what they describe as the university s continued financial investment in corporations that profit from Israeli apartheid genocide and military occupation of Palestine according to a news release from Columbia University Apartheid Divest.   The protests come as the death toll of Israel s war in Gaza has continued to rise. At least 34097 Palestinians have been killed and 76980 injured since October according to the enclave s health ministry. Israel launched ongoing attacks after a Hamas attack on October 7 killed more than 1200 people.   The demonstrations and the suspension and arrests of students involved have inspired solidarity rallies at other universities including Yale Harvard the University of North Carolina and Boston University.   Allegations of violence have also appeared at some of these other demonstrations.   A Yale sophomore Sahar Tartak says another student assaulted her with a Palestinian flag Saturday while she was documenting a proPalestinian demonstration on campus. Video of the incident from Tartak shows a student passing by while holding a Palestinian flag before the person filming exclaims Ow ow!   video Related video Hear voice notes from Gaza I lost my family and myself   Yale s Office of Public Affairs said in a statement The Yale Police Department is investigating a report of an assault that occurred during a protest on Beinecke Plaza. The university does not tolerate violence threats harassment or intimidation of members of our community and is providing support to a student who made the report.   In a statement Yale Jews for Ceasefire called the action unacceptable.   Last night a counterprotester said she was poked in the eye with a flag. Such an action whether or not it was intentional is unacceptable. We are fundamentally committed to maintaining a nonviolent and welcoming protest environment in which all community members can make their voices heard the group said in a statement.   In January the International Court of Justice found that Israel was plausibly violating laws on genocide in its war on Gaza and ordered Israel to take all measures to prevent genocide.   In response Israel rejected what it called the grossly distorted accusation of genocide leveled against it by South Africa over its military action in Gaza telling the United Nations top court the case was an attempt to pervert the meaning of the term.   One Columbia law school student Elijah Emery who is Jewish told CNN Sunday that the right of peaceful protest is paramount.   I m personally extremely disturbed by the use of the police to disrupt the encampment he said. It was a mistake by the university. It made me more supportive of the encampment and what it represents about free speech.   He contrasted the pretty peaceful environment on campus with the more energized demonstrations outside campus referencing deeply disheartening incidents that took place Saturday night outside campus by people Emery said were not affiliated with the university. He added that some more observant Jewish friends of his had experienced harassment but that Jewish students should feel safe on campus.   Especially during the day I m never really worried about anything getting out of hand he said.

https://carnegieendowment.org/publications/interactive/protest-tracker, A onestop source for following crucial trends in the most significant antigovernment protests worldwide since 2017. Last updated on April 8 2024  For a short informational summary of recent proIsrael and proPalestine protests and rallies click here.On and around the second anniversary of the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine proUkraine demonstrations were held in many countries especially in Europe and North America but also in Asia Australia and South America. Use Carnegie s Global Protest Tracker to analyze and compare the triggers motivations and other aspects of many of the most significant antigovernment protests since 2017. Designed for researchers decisionmakers and journalists this comprehensive resource helps illustrate how protests impact today s global politics. Protests related to COVID19 the disease caused by the new coronavirus. See the note under Protest significance on the Limitations tab. Protests that have resulted in a significant government policy or leadership change. Protests that have experienced violent government crackdowns. Time span between the first and last reports of the protests. Rating of a country in the Freedom House s annual Freedom in the World report at the time the protest started reflecting the status of political rights and civil liberties in that country. Systemic concerns that underlie the protest movement. To encapsulate a broad range of antigovernment grievances the three overarching categories of motivations are economic political and corruption. Corruption is considered separately because it can be economic andor political in nature and often stems from government officials conduct rather than government policies. These categories of motivations are not exclusive protests are often driven by a diverse range of concerns. Reported nearterm policy changes or leadership changes in response to the protests. Protests commonly used name if any for example the Yellow Vest protests or an abbreviated description of the protests. Sizable street protests that express opposition to the national government as a whole or to its recent policies or actions. When the protests are first reported in local or national news. Specific issues events or policy changes that sparked the protest. The tracker focuses on antigovernment protests. It excludes rallies in support of a political cause party or political figure. Protests may be intermittent rather than constant stopping and starting over weeks or months. The tracker focuses on outcomes that are direct responses to the protests specifically policy or leadership changes that occur in the short term during or after a protest. As a result it excludes events or changes that occur later of which the protests may only be one of many causal factors. Reliable and accurate information on the number of protesters is not always available. In many cases the only sources of information on a protest s size are local authorities who often underestimate the size of protests or protest organizers who may overestimate the size of protests. There is no scientifically precise way to define a significant protest. The word significant here is understood in terms of political importance the impact of a protest on a country s political life. While a protest s size can give some indication of its importance it is not determinative on its own. A large protest in a country where protesting is legal and occurs frequently may not be as significant as a small protest in a country where public demonstrations are banned and authorities are known to use violence against protesters. To account for the varying environments for protests across regime types this tracker generally considers protests in contexts with a Freedom in the World rating of free or partly free to be significant if the protest s peak size reaches or exceeds 10000 protesters and protests with a Freedom in the World rating of not free to be significant if the protest s peak size reaches or exceeds 1000 protesters.  Although most protests directly related to the coronavirus outbreak are so far quite small they have been included in the tracker because of their potential impact on governance and policy at the local national and international levels and because of the overriding importance of the pandemic crisis.  The data are based on reporting from credible news sources with some crossreferencing for verification when possible.

Climate change protests have emerged as a significant force in the environmental movement galvanizing public attention and influencing policy at the highest levels. These demonstrations driven by a sense of urgency and a call for immediate action have played a critical role in shaping the global response to the climate crisis. From grassroots campaigns to largescale mobilizations activists have highlighted the dire consequences of inaction and the need for a united front against the threats posed by a warming planet. The following ten climate change protests have not only captured the world s attention but have also spurred tangible changes reflecting the power of collective voices in the fight for a sustainable future. The inaugural Earth Day on April 22 1970 was a watershed moment in environmental activism. Spearheaded by Senator Gaylord Nelson and inspired by the antiwar movement it brought together 20 million Americans in a unified call for environmental reform. This unprecedented mobilization led to significant legislative outcomes including the establishment of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of the Clean Air Clean Water and Endangered Species Acts. Earth Day s success demonstrated the potential of public protest to enact environmental change and has since become an annual global event mobilizing communities around the world to protect the planet.Image earthday.org Greenpeace s inception in 1971 with its maiden voyage to protest nuclear testing in Amchitka Alaska marked the beginning of its journey as a major force in environmental activism. The organization s directaction approach and its campaigns against whaling seal hunting and toxic waste dumping have been instrumental in raising awareness and bringing about policy changes. Greenpeace s daring exploits such as confronting whaling ships on the high seas have captured the public imagination and drawn attention to the exploitation of the planet s resources making it one of the most recognizable environmental organizations globally.Image Greenpeace USA Originating in the Himalayan region of India in the 1970s the Chipko movement was a pioneering effort in forest conservation. Villagers in Uttarakhand primarily women embraced trees to shield them from being felled symbolizing the intrinsic value of nature. This nonviolent resistance drew inspiration from Gandhi s principles and highlighted the vital role of forests in sustaining local economies and ecosystems. The Chipko movement s legacy endures having inspired similar initiatives worldwide and contributing to the development of India s environmental policy.Image Reddit The 1999 World Trade Organization WTO protests in Seattle known as the Battle of Seattle were a landmark in environmental and antiglobalization activism. Thousands of protesters from diverse groups converged to voice their opposition to WTO policies which they believed exacerbated environmental degradation and social inequality. The demonstrations disrupted the conference and highlighted the intersection of environmental concerns with issues of global economic governance labor rights and social justice bringing environmental activism into the broader context of global solidarity.Image AP The Kyoto Rally of 2001 stands as a pivotal moment in the history of climate activism. Sparked by President George W. Bush s decision to withdraw the United States from the Kyoto Protocol a landmark international treaty aimed at curbing greenhouse gas emissions the Campaign Against Climate Change galvanized public sentiment into action. The protest not only marked a significant outcry against the U.S. government s stance but also set the stage for a succession of global movements. It underscored the growing global concern over climate change and the collective demand for accountable actionable measures from world leaders. This rally was not just a singular event it was the catalyst for the first National Climate March in 2005 which brought thousands to the streets aligning with the annual United Nations climate talks and amplifying the voice of the people in the international arena.Image Getty Images The Keystone XL pipeline became a flashpoint for environmental activism in North America. Protests began in 2010 when indigenous groups ranchers and environmentalists united to oppose the pipeline s construction citing threats to ecosystems water sources and indigenous sovereignty. The sustained campaign included acts of civil disobedience and legal challenges culminating in the Obama administration s decision to reject the pipeline in 2015. This victory for environmentalists underscored the effectiveness of persistent grassroots opposition to fossil fuel infrastructure.Image AFP via Getty Images The fossil fuel divestment movement initiated by students at Swarthmore College in 2011 has since burgeoned into a global campaign. It calls for institutions to divest their holdings in fossil fuel companies aiming to stigmatize the industry and hasten the transition to renewable energy. The movement has seen successes at universities religious organizations and financial institutions influencing billions of dollars in investment and sending a clear message that the public no longer supports the fossil fuel economy.Image Getty Images Inspired by Greta Thunberg s solitary strike for climate action in 2018 Fridays for Future has mobilized a generation of young people across the globe. Students skipping school on Fridays to demand urgent climate action from their leaders have become a formidable voice in the climate debate. The movement has organized global strikes drawing millions into the streets and proving that the youth are not only the future but also a potent force for change in the present.Image Getty Images The Extinction Rebellion protests of April 2019 marked a significant chapter in climate activism. The movement known for its distinctive approach of nonviolent civil disobedience captured the world s attention through a series of impactful and creative demonstrations. Their actions which included occupying bridges gluing themselves to buildings and staging dieins were not just about protest but also about communicating the urgency of the climate crisis. The culmination of their efforts was a historic achievement when the UK Parliament declared a climate emergency becoming the first nation to do so.Image rebellion.org Around COP27 climate activists engaged in a variety of creative protests including throwing tomato soup on Van Gogh s painting to highlight the urgency of stopping new oil and gas projects. These protests aimed to draw attention to the lack of credible pathways to limit global temperature rise.Image Reuters Books about voting and elections every Indian citizen must read A virtual tour of ShivShakti Ajay Devgn and Kajols beautiful home StoriesSEE AllSix ways to fix range anxiety faced by EV owners in India Why 25000 teachers in Bengal are at risk of losing their jobs A weighty issue Prediabetes sees a sharp rise among Mumbai teens Blaze at Delhis mountain of shame leaves capital gasping for breath monil shah has posted 10 comments on Timesofindia.com to earn the Wordsmith Level 1 badge.

AP PhotoSusan Walsh NEW YORK AP Student protests over the war in Gaza have created a new and unpredictable challenge for President Joe Biden as he resists calls to cut off U.S. support for Israel while trying to hold together the coalition of voters he ll need for reelection. The protests at Columbia University in New York and other campuses have captured global media attention and resurfaced questions about Biden s lagging support from young voters. His handling of the Middle East conflict is also being closely watched by both Jewish and Arab American voters in key swing states. At best for Biden the protests are a passing distraction while the White House presses forward with negotiations over a ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas while pushing Israel to limit casualties with more than 34000 Palestinians dead. At worst they build momentum toward the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August potentially triggering scenes of violence that could recall the unrest of protests against the Vietnam War during the party s convention there in 1968.   Columbia University cites progress with Gaza war protesters after encampment arrests Protests at US campuses are pressing colleges to cut financial ties with Israel With graduation near colleges seek to balance safety and students right to protest Gaza war If it ends with Columbia that s one thing said Angus Johnston a historian focused on campus activism. If this sends the national student movement to a new place that s a very different situation.  Already Biden s aides have had to work to minimize disruptions from antiwar protesters holding smaller campaign events and tightly controlling access. Demonstrators forced his motorcade to change routes to the Capitol on his way to deliver the State of the Union and they ve thrown a red substance intended to symbolize blood near his home in Delaware. The president could face more confrontations with students this spring. Morehouse College said Tuesday that Biden would appear at the iconic historically Black campus in May to deliver a commencement address that could draw protests.

Jose Carlos FajardoBay Area News Group via AP More than 100 proPalestinian demonstrators camped out at Columbia were arrested Thursday with dozens more people arrested at other campuses. Many now face charges of trespassing or disorderly conduct. The protesters have demanded that their universities condemn Israel s assault on Gaza after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack and divest from companies that do business with Israel. Some people have reported antisemitic chants and messages at and around the Columbia campus and similar concerns have been reported at other universities. Some Jewish students say they ve felt unsafe on campus. The White House in a message Sunday to mark the Passover holiday denounced what it called an alarming surge of antisemitism saying it has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere in our country.  Four Jewish Democratic members of Congress toured Columbia s lockeddown campus on Monday with members of the school s Jewish Law Students Association. They condemned that things had escalated to where Jewish students felt unsafe and the university canceled inperson classes Monday. Columbia said it would use hybrid remote and inperson learning through the end of the spring term. Rep. Kathy Manning of North Carolina called on the Education Department and Justice Department to work with the White House to ensure that all universities take steps necessary to keep Jewish students and faculty safe.   This discrimination is simply unacceptable and cannot be allowed to continue she said.   Columbia University professors rally in solidarity with their students rights to protest free from arrest at the Columbia University campus in New York on Monday April 22 2024. AP PhotoStefan Jeremiah Biden on Monday sought the same middle ground that he s staked out for months as he backs Israel s military operations with weapons shipments while also pushing Israel to limit civilian casualties and get more humanitarian aid into Gaza where the United Nations has said there is a looming famine.   I condemn the antisemitic protests the president said at an Earth Day event. He then added I also condemn those who don t understand what s going on with the Palestinians.  Rep. Alexandria OcasioCortez of New York a highprofile progressive who represents parts of the Bronx and Queens spoke before Biden at the same event. She said it was important that we remember the power of young people shaping this country and praised the leadership of those peaceful studentled protests.  Former President Donald Trump Biden s presumptive Republican opponent in November pointed to the headlines and images coming out of Columbia to redirect focus from his criminal hush money trial in New York telling reporters in the courthouse Tuesday that Biden bears the blame for the unrest.   If this were me you d be after me. You d be after me so much he said. But they re trying to give him a pass. But what s going on is a disgrace to our country and it s all Biden s fault and everybody knows it.  In a sign of the political potency of the situation at Columbia Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana planned to visit the school Wednesday and meet with Jewish students. Joel Rubin a former State Department official and Democratic strategist who has worked in Jewish politics for years rejected critics blaming Biden for everything that s gone wrong but said the president would have to make the argument for why the policy is the right one and let the chips fall where they may.   If it were purely politics and polling it would be a very hard one Rubin said. But I think Biden is making these decisions based on national security.  Biden graduated from Syracuse s law school in 1968 bypassing the campus convulsions over the Vietnam War. He distanced himself from that protest movement two decades later during his first run for president.  I was married I was in law school I wore sports coats Biden said in 1987. You re looking at a middleclass guy. I am who I am. I m not big on flak jackets and tiedyed shirts. You know that s not me.  Biden has been endorsed this year by many leading youth activist organizations and built his campaign around key social issues such as defending abortion rights combating climate change and canceling student debt for millions that they believe can energize voters under 30 who are more likely to be concerned about his approach to Gaza.  He was in Florida on Tuesday to capitalize on the momentum against nationwide abortion restrictions and criticize a state law soon to go into effect that will ban abortions after six weeks before many women know they re pregnant. A day earlier Vice President Kamala Harris held an event promoting abortion rights in swing state Wisconsin.  Safia Southey a 25yearold law student at Columbia who is Jewish has been participating in the protest and sleeping at the encampment on the university s quad since Thursday. She believes outrage over the war will deflate Biden s chances against Trump because staunch supporters of Israel are more likely to support the presumptive Republican nominee.  I think Biden has tried to be very strategic and it s backfired in a lot of ways she said. However Southey said she ll vote for Biden pretty much no matter what in a matchup with Trump.  The students who are upset especially at these kind of universities are smart enough to not stay home she said. I think that they re going to go out and vote and they re going to go for the most strategic option even if they re not happy for Biden. I think that they would do anything to make sure that Trump s not in office.  Democratic pollster Cornell Belcher was skeptical that campus demonstrations over Gaza would prove to be politically influential.  What percentage of Americans are really in those narrow spaces and how representative are they of a broader American audience or even a broader youth audience? he asked. Johnston the historian on student activism said the current protests don t approach the size or intensity of demonstrations in the 1960s when school officials were held hostage and campuses were vandalized.  But over the years he said there s a lot of times where student protests have shaped the national debate.  Weissert and Megerian reported from Washington.

Bassam Khawaja a lecturer at Columbia law school and supervising attorney at the school s human rights clinic said he was shocked and appalled that the president went immediately to the New York police department .  It didn t seem like any kind of measures were taken to deescalate Khawaja said. It also just seems completely unnecessary. This was by all accounts a nonviolent protest. It was a group of students camping out on the lawn in the middle of campus. It s not any different from everyday life on campus.  Students have called for their universities to back a ceasefire in Gaza and divest from companies with ties to Israel. On Monday Columbia s president Nemat Minouche Shafik said that school leaders would be convening to discuss the crisis NBC News reported. Shafik also claimed that antisemitic language and intimidating and harassing behavior towards Jewish students had taken place on campus recently The decibel of our disagreements has only increased in recent days. These tensions have been exploited and amplified by individuals who are not affiliated with Columbia who have come to campus to pursue their own agendas We need a reset.  Student demonstrators including Jewish students have denied accusations that their protests are antisemitic blaming inflammatory individuals who do not represent us and describing the protests as peaceful and inclusive.  We firmly reject any form of hate or bigotry and stand vigilant against nonstudents attempting to disrupt the solidarity being forged amount students Palestinian Muslim Arab Jewish Black and proPalestinian classmates and colleagues who represent the full diversity of our country read a statement from student organizers posted to Instagram. The Columbia and Barnard chapters of the American Association of University Professors decried Shafik s crackdowns on protests in a statement on Friday saying We are shocked at her failure to mount any defense of the free inquiry central to the educational mission of a university.  Journalism professor Helen Benedict who was on campus when the NYPD began arresting students said in an interview that sending riot police with guns on to campus was an overreaction . On Monday long lines formed outside the gates of Columbia as students had to wait to have their IDs scanned at security checkpoints. Some faculty members were at the gates advocating for reporters who had been denied entry. The protests have prompted national attention with political leaders of both parties condemning university leadership. In Virginia Joe Biden denounced antisemitism on college campuses in a statement marking Passover which began on Monday. He said This blatant antisemitism is reprehensible and dangerous and it has absolutely no place on college campuses or anywhere in our country.  Speaking before Biden at the Virginia event the progressive New York congresswoman Alexandria OcasioCortez appeared to reference the campus demonstrations in her remarks saying It is especially important that we remember the power of young people shaping this country today of all days.  One of the suspended students at Columbia was Isra Hirsi the daughter of the Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar. Omar of Minnesota and her fellow progressive Rashida Tlaib of Michigan also condemned punishments against Hirsi and other student protesters the Hill reported. Omar said university protests were being coopted and made to look bad so police and public leaders would shut them down similar to other movements in the past The Columbia protesters have made clear their demands and want their school not to be complacent in the ongoing genocide in Gaza. Public officials and media making this about anything else are inflaming the situation and need to bring calmness and sanity back.  The New York governor Kathy Hochul convened a meeting with Columbia administrators city officials and police on Monday and a group of Jewish House Democrats also met Jewish students.  While the leadership of Columbia may be failing you we will not Josh Gottheimer a Democratic congressman from New Jersey said during a press conference on campus. If Columbia fails to keep Jewish students safe Gottheimer warned that the university s leadership would pay the price . Congressman Dan Goldman a New York Democrat said what Jewish students told him they had witnessed was unacceptable at an academic institution of learning . Other US colleges and universities have announced extreme measures to punish students who participate in peaceful protests supporting Palestine. The University of Michigan announced it would draft new rules to punish disruptive behavior after students held a protest during the university s convocation ceremony on Sunday. Students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Emerson College both in the Boston area have started encampment protests inspired by the demonstration at Columbia. Videos on X showed students at New York University in Manhattan erecting a new encampment on their campus as well as students at the University of North Carolina doing the same. NYU s office of global campus safety ordered students to clear their encampments by 4pm on Monday after officials allegedly witnessed disorderly disruptive and antagonizing behavior as additional protesters attempted to participate in the demonstrations.  You will need to clear the plaza by 4.00pm. If you leave now no one will face any consequences for today s actions no discipline no police according to a post to X from the university. Mass arrests began around 8.30pm local time. Prahlad Iyengar an MIT graduate student studying electrical engineering was among about two dozen students who set up an encampment of more than a dozen tents on campus on Sunday evening to call for a ceasefire and to protest what they describe as MIT s complicity in the ongoing genocide in Gaza .  MIT has not even called for a ceasefire and that s a demand we have for sure he said. The Associated Press contributed reporting This article was amended on 23 April 2024 to correct Bassam Khawaja s title and to clarify a quotation from Helen Benedict in which she said riot police were called on to campus.
