https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/education/2023/09/24/climate-week-2023-youth-protests-education/70930836007/,  Everything I learned about climate change was selftaught said Amara Ifeji 21 now a senior at Northeastern University in Boston and an environmental justice advocate. Her lowincome high school in Maine didn t require climate change instruction for students in her particular science technology engineering and math program let alone instruction that addressed the uneven impacts on people of color. This observers say amounts to a missed academic opportunity. At a time when schools are struggling to recover from pandemicera losses why not incorporate into lessons an issue that students care about deeply?  Young people s emotions around climate change stem from how much their futures will be affected by it and the sense that older adults have done relatively little to brighten their prospects.  Right now Schifter continued climate change is insufficiently taught in American schools.  While biology textbooks coverage of climate change has increased overall since the 1970s the study found it dropped off a little in the 2010s. In the 2000s the textbooks included a median of 52 sentences on climate change according to research by North Carolina State scholars. In the 2010s the median dipped to 45 sentences less than three pages. It s become a kind of curricular hot potato said Bill Bigelow a former social studies teacher and codirector at the Zinn Education Project who has helped edit and write climate education lessons. Adequate climate education he said necessitates coverage in not just science classes but subjects ranging from history to language arts.  Yet this interdisciplinary relevance makes it especially dicey. The standards that states and school districts and teachers adhere to lag behind the consciousness of the crisis he said.  Some policymakers and politicians have tried hard to control our school system and control what we re learning in classrooms said Adah Crandall 17 a recent high school graduate in Portland Oregon and organizer with the Sunrise Movement a youthled climate justice group. Students have been caught in the middle of this political battle. When she did learn about such issues in school it was because the educators went out of their way to gather materials and devise lessons. In Crandall s view existing school policies and resources made that a difficult feat. The reach has been uneven with many districts particularly those in lowincome areas that are arguably hardest hit by the consequences of environmental destruction lacking the necessary resources. Limited professional development is another major challenge said Carolyn McGrath an art teacher in New Jersey who incorporates climate justice education into her classes. Visual imagery can have a different impact on people and can often move them emotionally move their hearts and minds in a way a rational argument might not said McGrath whose assignments include multimedia portraits of youth climate activists. But McGrath is in the minority of teachers or at least of nonscience teachers who feel comfortable incorporating climate change into their lessons. The whole of climate change education climate justice education can I think be intimidating to teachers who do not have a science background. Nationally imbalances in who gets access to the most comprehensive and actionoriented climate change lessons persist.  Ifeji the college student from Maine remembers being one of just a few people of color at her high school where she advocated not just for climate solutions but also for racial justice. The issues she said are interconnected.   Four years ago I was just in my basement growing plants just a science fair kid at 17 years old she said. Her passion for natural sciences and her recognition of the threats to what she loved especially as a Black woman quickly grew into a desire to advocate and organize.   What led me to this work wasn t actually having connections it was a lack of connections she said. Maine is known for our pristine woods its outdoor landscapes. It seems like people have opportunities to engage in the outdoors. But in the case of youth of color like myself those opportunities were very few and far between.

https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/11/27/opinion/cop28-climate-change-education/, Over the past 13 years my students have consistently expressed disappointment and dismay that they hadn t previously been taught about the climate crisis or the many environmental justice issues that plague their communities as a result. Climate change is threatening their futures they see the world is on fire and yet very few of them have had any formal climate change education before entering my classroom. It s not just the students who are upset an NPRIpsos poll conducted in 2019 showed that more than 80 percent of US parents surveyed support the teaching of climate change in schools. Confronting climate change requires a multifaceted approach of mitigation and adaptation measures such as limiting deforestation and improving infrastructure to deal with flooding and storm surges. Several largescale systemic changes need to be made ranging from better environmental policy to investment in renewable energy like solar wind farms and geothermal power. But as Carl Sagan once said Our passion for learning is our tool for survival. Climate change education should be a compulsory and standardized part of the national curriculum starting at the elementary school level. And not just in science but woven across all subjects because climate change involves so much more than science. A 2020 study on the role of climate change education on individual lifetime carbon emissions showed that climate change education can be as effective in reducing carbon emissions as other solutions such as rooftop solar or electric vehicles. Through education students feel empowered to make a difference which impacts their future choices. The study showed that students who completed a oneyear university course reduced their future individual carbon emissions by approximately 2.86 tons of CO2 per year. According to the EPA this is the equivalent of planting approximately 40 trees. Consider the impact if that education began in kindergarten instead. Next Generation Science Standards published in 2013 advised that humanmade climate change be taught from fifth grade onward in all science classes. The standards are not mandatory and therefore each state has the authority to decide what is taught or not taught. This creates large disparities in climate change curriculum nationally. As Glenn Branch deputy director of the National Center for Science Education noted the fact that humancaused climate change is included in a state s science standards doesn t mean that teachers in that state do teach it. No wonder so many of my students feel grossly unprepared. What are the primary challenges that hinder climate education in schools? Politics and funding. In 2023 the Florida Department of Education authorized classroom use of climate denial videos from a conservative group known for promoting misleading science. In some states the fossil fuel industry provides funding for books or professional development which may lead to false or biased narratives entering the classroom. To educate about climate change effectively schools need funding for teachers to receive appropriate training and purchase reputable materials. New Jersey was the first state to mandate climate change education starting in kindergarten as of 2020. Most recently Connecticut included climate change as part of the required science curriculum for grades 5 through 12. These measures help protect funding from budget cuts or other political disruptions. Yet even when states fund climate education initiatives school districts that serve marginalized communities may not receive the same opportunities despite being at higher climate risk. In Massachusetts there are currently a few bills regarding climate education reform. House Bill 470 would create a Climate Science Education Trust Fund which would help fund materials and professional training. House Bill 496 involves amending the science standards to include climate justice education at the elementary and secondary levels. Neither of the bills has seen much momentum. At present education is being severely underutilized as a mitigation tool in the climate crisis. Making climate education a required and measurable part of the national K12 curricula across content areas needs to be a priority. Funding should be appropriated in an equitable manner so that all students receive a comprehensive climate education regardless of the community they live in. It is imperative that the next generation understands the complexity of environmental problems and the social justice issues involved. We need them to develop intersectional solutions and advocate for climatefriendly policy. The scientific consensus is clear and indisputable humanmade climate change is real it is happening but there is hope. As one of my students put it considering we all live on this planet shouldn t we be required to learn how to take care of it? Now that s a lesson the attendees at COP28 and Massachusetts policy makers should consider. Anita Soracco is a professor of physics and environmental science at Quinsigamond Community College.
https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2023/02/09/climate-education-in-the-u-s-where-it-stands-and-why-it-matters/, Ren e Cho Young people across the globe are concerned about climate change. A Lancet study surveying 10000 young people ages 16 to 25 in 10 countries found that more than half felt sadness anxiety anger and guilt about climate change. They are seeing the impacts of a warming planet in the news and in their own communities but many feel helpless and powerless. The young want solutions they want to know what they can do about climate change. In 2021 at COP26 in Glasgow the ministers of education and environment committed to including climate change education in all educational institutions recognizing the large remaining gaps in providing everyone with knowledge skills values and attitudes needed to effectively participate in the transition towards climate positive societies. However the same year a UNESCO study of almost 50 countries revealed that less than half made any mention of climate change in their educational policies. Moreover only 21 percent of the new or updated plans submitted by 95 countries as their Paris Agreement goals mentioned climate change education none of them presented it as a climate strategy.  The time is now to include climate education as a key climate risk mitigation strategy along with energy transformation land uses and water and to make climate education a mandatory part of the national curriculum according to Radhika Iyengar director of the education sector at Columbia Climate School s Center for Sustainable Development.  In fact a 2020 study found that if 16 percent of secondary school equivalent to middle and high school students around the world in middle and high income countries studied climate change it would result in cutting almost 19 gigatons of CO2 by 2050. This is because educated youth would develop personal connections to climate change solutions and change their behaviors accordingly throughout their lives. Climate education was shown to potentially be a more effective way to reduce emissions than many other single solutions. Young people recognize that climate change is going to shape their futures where they live the work they will do and their quality of life. They need climate education in order to develop green skills adapt to the harsh reality of a warming world and understand how to combat climate change. But they need to learn the basics of climate change before they can do anything about it. In the U.S. more than 86 percent of teachers and 84 percent of parents support climate change education in schools. Progress is being made in some states but on the whole students are not learning enough about climate science quickly enough to give them the knowledge and tools they will need to cope with the impacts of climate change.  The education system is failing the students when it comes to climate change or climate education in the formal curriculum said Iyengar. We really need to pick up speed because otherwise we will have a whole generation of students who will graduate with this climate anxiety and will not know what to do because they have not been prepared by our education systems.  At the start of this year two measures that would have supported climate change education died in Congress. There is still no national consensus about the importance of climate education and the U.S. does not have national science standards. Each state determines what its schools teach and this can vary greatly. A public school s curriculum must follow state education guidelines which dictate what a student should know at the end of a grade or subject. How and what they are taught to get there is up to the individual school districts and teachers. An early effort to establish science standards in 1996 was largely ignored by states. But in 2013 the Next Generation Science Standards NGSS were developed by the National Research Council National Science Teachers Association American Association for the Advancement of Science the nonprofit Achieve and over 24 states. They recommended that manmade climate change be taught beginning in fifth grade and incorporated into all science classes. However the standards are voluntary. Fortyfour states use the NGSS or have crafted standards based on them the rest developed their own science standards. Seven years after the NGSS were introduced the National Center for Science Education and the Texas Freedom Network Education Fund graded the states climate education. Twentyseven states including 20 states and the District of Columbia that adopted the NGSS scored B or better. Of the rest 20 got a C or lower with 10 of them scoring a D. Alabama Georgia Pennsylvania South Carolina Texas and Virginia received Fs. While one study from the National Center for Science Education found that 75 percent of public school science teachers do cover climate change another 2016 survey of 1500 middle and high school teachers found that they only devoted one or two hours to climate change during the entire academic year. There are however two examples of leadership in climate education New Jersey and Connecticut. In 2020 New Jersey became the first state to mandate the teaching of climate change in all subjects beginning in kindergarten. The state budget includes 5 million for grants that will fund technical assistance professional development for teachers lesson plans and evaluation strategies. New Jersey schools are required to teach climate change across all subjects including visual and performing arts health and physical education science social studies world languages computer science and key skills. Here s what that can look like. Kindergarten through second graders can explore artwork responding to climate change from different perspectives. Grades three to five science classes may teach how energy and fuel are derived from natural resources and their impacts on the environment. Middle school students compare the environmental effects of different technologies that tackle climate change issues and evaluate them in computer science class. High school students collaborate with students from other countries in social studies class to develop solutions to environmental justice issues. The ambition is commendable. However the reality is that climate education cannot be taught equally effectively throughout the state. In poorer districts schools may lack the resources to implement the program these are often communities of color that are most vulnerable to climate impacts.  I think they are doing their best said Iyengar who is a New Jersey resident. But probably we should have been doing this two decades back.  In 2022 Connecticut passed a law requiring public schools to incorporate lessons on human caused climate change into their science curriculum in line with the NGSS beginning this July. Ninety percent of the state s schools already teach climate change but the new law ensures that climate education will not be subject to political or budget changes. Students will learn about manmade climate change its impacts on various communities and potential solutions. Fifth eighth and 11th graders will be tested on their understanding of climate change. Oregon educators have drafted a bill that would require climate education across all subjects in grades K through 12. They are currently seeking support for it. Massachusetts a science and biotech center ranked very low in a study of climate change curriculum policy. The state s science framework does mention climate change but not what districts must teach and climate change is not included in the state s elementary learning standards. Students may learn about weather but not necessarily how it relates to climate change. There are outside efforts to expand climate education however such as Change is Simple a nonprofit based in Beverly MA that provides climate change and sustainability programs to elementary and middle schools.  The current state of climate education in the U.S. is fast evolving and actually it s very promising said Iyengar. It s fast evolving at the policy level but the current practice of climate education in the schools has yet to see the light. It is a slow and evolving process.  A 2021 report found that 78 percent of registered voters support climate education including liberal to conservative Democrats Independents moderate Republicans and even 46 percent of conservative Republicans. But while most blue states have good climate education standards the quality of climate education in red states varies. The Republican party platform in Oklahoma a top natural gas producing state where 43 percent of Republicans support climate education reads We oppose the teaching of the theory of anthropogenic global warming without providing equal time for instruction in the complex systems of geophysics sic that cause observable climate change such as solar variations plate tectonics and volcanic eruptions. It does not mention that 99.9 percent of scientists are in agreement that human activity is warming the planet. While state boards of education and school superintendents are not bound by party platforms it may be difficult for them to avoid political influence. Other red states undermine climate education by ignoring it or sowing doubt about the scientific consensus. In Florida the term climate change is absent from the education standards for elementary and middle school which haven t been updated since 2008. South Dakota introduced legislation calling for the balanced teaching of global warming. And Kentucky introduced a bill that encourages teachers to teach the advantages and disadvantages of scientific theories such as global warming. In 2009 the Texas Board of Education said that teachers must present both sides the impacts of human activity and natural causes when discussing global warming. Many teachers recognize that climate change is a political issue so teaching both sides of the issue is a way to avoid controversy. The 2016 study found that 30 percent of teachers taught that recent changes in climate were due to natural causes with 12 percent not emphasizing human causes at all. Data shows that what teachers understand about the scientific consensus on climate change largely aligns with their political ideology. Because climate change has been politicized textbook publishers often use ambiguous language that avoids controversy to secure approval for their books by the boards of education of the large markets. Texas the top oil and natural gas producing state in the nation is also the largest market for science textbooks for K12 and has its own science standards. A recent study of 57 college biology textbooks published between 1970 and 2019 found that in the 2010s coverage of climate change decreased. The high point was an average of 52 sentences about climate change in the 2000s but it dropped to 45 sentences in the 2010s. Moreover solutions to climate change which had comprised 15 percent of the climate content in the 1990s fell to three percent. Information about climate change was also left to the last two percent of the text making the topic easier to shortchange if teachers run out of time. The fossil fuel industry directly provides educational resources. There s been a multibilliondollar campaign by the fossil fuel industry to make the American public doubt climate change and some of it has been specifically targeted at children according to Katie Worth author of Miseducation How Climate Change is Taught in America. This takes the form of fossil fuel friendly educational lessons created by the fossil fuel industry as well as professional development seminars for teachers. Worth found educational programs funded by the fossil fuel industry in 25 states. For example the Oklahoma Energy Resources Board was found to have spent almost 40 million on profossil fuel industry educational materials over the past 20 years. Profossil fuel programs promote the idea that energy regulation will hurt the free market and that renewable energy is unreliable. In one Arkansas classroom a visiting oil and gas industry representative from Arkansas Energy Rocks told students about problems with renewable energy how access to reliable electricity could be a matter of life and death and that if the U.S. shut down all fossil fuel use tomorrow it would make a minuscule dent in global warming. Arkansas Energy Rocks provides classroom speakers K12 lessons and free summer workshops for teachers. Fossil fuel industrysponsored professional development workshops for teachers are insidious because many teachers feel they themselves don t know enough about climate change to teach it. Even schools where there are climate education standards may fall short because their teachers need more training. The executive director of the Smithsonian Science Education Center said that teachers need better training complete guidelines and instructional materials to teach climate change. Teachers themselves recognize this. One survey reported that the two biggest things teachers said they wanted to address climate change more effectively was information about what to do and the resources to do it. Responding to the need for more professional development many organizations are providing resources. To name a few Subject to Climate staffed by teachers scientists and climate activists provides lesson plans that integrate climate change for K12 in all subjects. Clime Time offers science teacher training linking NGSS with climate science. Globe.gov an international science and education program offers handson interdisciplinary activities and inquiries into various Earth systems. Teachers can access educational resources focused on K12 students including Earth science storybooks lesson plans and activities for children of all ages. The NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies which works closely with the Columbia Climate School offers the NASA Climate Change Research Initiative for teachers and graduate students. It is a yearlong opportunity to work directly with NASA scientists and lead research teams on a NASA research project related to climate change. Matthew Pearce NASA education program specialist said The teacher has to be teaching a course that is relevant to the project and has to have subject matter competence in that field. And what we try to do is align the teacher s experience in this program with their immediate regular school needs. In the summer a high school and undergrad intern are added to the project team. Teachers are then challenged to translate a component of their NASA research topic and experience leading the research teams into a unit plan to implement in their classrooms and to integrate NASA s many educational resources into that plan while performing community STEM engagement events. Approximately 160 teachers graduate students and interns have gone through the program which takes place at NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York City or NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt MD. The teachers that come through this program end up being very substantial ambassadors for us going forward said Pearce. One such example is Sarah Slack an eighth grade science teacher in Brooklyn who is teaching handson climate science with the help of NASA s resources innumerable tools platforms programs and teams NASA offers for teachers.Many of the teachers have also been successful in publishing their work through NASA and other scientific journals. Pearce said the goal is also to Try to create strong pipelines and STEM ecosystems for their students and communities to apply to our internship program or engage with our other education and citizen science programs such as NASA s Science Activation Program. The Science Activation Program puts together teams from across the nation to engage learners with NASA teams science experts andcommunity leaders on a variety of science projects.  I feel very positive about climate education said Pearce. The teachers I ve worked with are deeply impassioned to learn more and share that with their students and try to be part of the solution. I see students in elementary school teachers and community members really learning to contribute and really yearning to make a difference.  The Columbia Climate School offers free climate and sustainability webinars for K12 students educators and the general public. These Climate Live K12 webinars are monthly onehour videos featuring experts from the Columbia Climate School and are geared towards students in grades 3 to 5 grades 6 to 8 and grades 9 to 12. In addition educational resources for teachers are provided. The videos are accessible on the Climate School s Youtube channel. The Columbia Climate School also offers educator training on single environmental topics and Saturday workshops for educators.  The goal is to help teachers gain knowledge for themselves as educators and as lifelong learners and then to implement it in their curriculum even if the standards aren t requiring them to teach climate change said Laurel ZaimaSheehy program manager of all the K12 and continuing education programs at the Columbia Climate School. Young people have many feelings and emotions about climate change these often stem from their connections to and feelings for nature. Teachers need to acknowledge this.  The element of caring for each other and caring for the planet needs to be integrated into climate education said Iyengar. If you re not emotionally connected with your environment it s very difficult to save it. And what helps students deal with their feelings are solutions so teachers need to offer opportunities for collective action and problem solving. Iyengar believes social emotional learning is key. Social emotional learning refers to the skills people need to be successful in life such as selfawareness goal setting managing emotions cultivating empathy social awareness relationship skills problemsolving and making good decisions. In climate education incorporating social emotional learning might include recognizing that humans are part of the web of life promoting understanding of environmental justice issues fostering collaborative problem solving to help develop solution and also introducing a spiritual connection with nature. Parents and students do not need to feel helpless about the state of climate education in their communities because there are actions they can take. Concerned parents can talk about the need for climate education with other parents and identify likeminded people with which to join forces. Parents and communities should also support teachers who want to teach climate change but face political pressure. Local school boards have the power to shape the curriculum so parents and students can attend school board meetings to push their school districts to adopt science standards that incorporate climate change. They can also request meetings with the principal of the school or individual school board members.  Students have a lot of power said Iyengar. There s a lot of advocacy and community mobilization to be done. Students can be a big part of raising these issues. They can form collectives and ask the Republican or Democratic candidates running for election what their climate agenda is and hold them accountable. Everyone can write to their representatives in Congress and urge them to mandate climate education.  There is a lot that can be done at a big scale at a small scale in your own classroom and in your own homes climate education is not only what we do in the classrooms said Iyengar. I think we need to be looking at it much more comprehensively. We are all in this together.  From February 23 to 25 the Center for Sustainable Development at the Columbia Climate School and the Sustainable Development Solutions Network USA will host the online the US Summit on Transformative Education 2023. The Summit will bring together organizations state departments of education academics teachers schools school principals university leaders the private sector and youth to share ideas and best practices and discuss and showcase research case studies and more about transforming education including climate change education.

Two clarifications to the Science standards in the U.S. section if I may. In the third paragraph the NCSETFNEF study graded the treatment of climate change in state science standards not in general as the states climate education might suggest. It should be noted also that the standards in several states have been revised since with substantial improvement in some cases.

If you take a look at the new PA STEELS standards please help me find inclusions that come close to conveying the importance of CC impacts now and in the future. By the way the new PA standards do not become required until 2025 and the NGSS are already over 10 years old.  Reply Jadon 9 months ago Thank you!

https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/if-climate-change-education-matters-why-dont-all-teachers-teach-it/2023/03,  Education needs to be a part of the set of tools that we re applying to address the climate crisis whether that s at the federal level the state level or the local level said Sarah Bodor the director of policy at the North American Association for Environmental Education. Right now education is being used inconsistently and not very holistically.    To better understand the barriers NAAEE surveyed about 700 U.S. teachers and 100 administrators and state policymakers last summer. These results complement a nationally representative survey of educators from the EdWeek Research Center conducted in December. Both surveys reveal that educators want to teach about climate change but don t feel properly equipped to do so. Nearly 80 percent of teachers principals and district leaders said it s important for U.S. schools to teach students the science behind climate change and its effects on the planet and society the EdWeek Research Center found. Of that group more than half said it was very important.  The NAAEE survey found that nearly threequarters of teachers agree that climate change will have an enormous impact on students futures and it is irresponsible not to address the problem and solutions in school. More than half of teachers also said their students brought up climate change on their own and 46 percent said their students are worried and anxious about the issue.  A quarter of teachers across grade levels and subjects say they don t teach anything about climate change topics or issues according to the EdWeek Research Center. When teachers do talk about climate change in the classroom their areas of focus vary. Nearly half of teachers focus on students own behavior and what they can do to lessen the effects of climate change the survey found. It s much less common for teachers to discuss topics like job opportunities related to sustainability environmental justice or policy debates and proposals to address the effects of climate change.Science teachers are more likely than other teachers to focus on the science behind climate change and how it will affect the future of the Earth and society.  The vast majority of states do not require comprehensive instruction on the subject outside of high school science class so the way it s taught can vary by school. The NAAEE survey found that on average teachers give their school a C for how climate change content is taught and incorporated in the classroom.  Here are three main reasons why despite the broad show of support climate change education has not become a priority in schools according to the surveys.  The NAAEE survey found that only 21 percent of teachers feel very informed about climate change. That echoes an EdWeek Research Center finding where 18 percent of teachers said they haven t addressed climate change or related issues with students because they re not well versed in the science behind climate change and feel out of their depth discussing it.  Unsurprisingly the NAAEE survey found that middle and high school science teachers are the most confident teaching about climate change and elementary teachers are the least confident. The EdWeek Research Center survey found that 26 percent of teachers said they haven t talked about climate change because they can t think of any way it is related to the subject they teach. Nine percent said they think their students are too young to learn about it.  Yet experts say comprehensive climate change education starts in the youngest grades and spans subject areas. New Jersey has required that climate change be taught in all grade levels and subjects and a similar push is underway in Oregon.   In elementary ages I don t think it s very appropriate to talk about climate change in any way that would induce fear NAAEE s Bodor said. It s more about just making observations with very very young students. There s a lot you can do with just noticing and observing weather and the local environment.

Here s How Madeline Will January 13 2023 8 min read Remove Save to favorites  Teachers lack of confidence in addressing climate change with their students may stem from a lack of preparation. The EdWeek Research Center survey found that about threequarters of teachers say they have never received any professional training or education on climate change or how to teach it. Another barrier is access to teaching materials. About half of teachers said they lack resources to teach effectively about climate change some of the time or always according to the NAAEE survey.  Bodor said that while those resources are out there they are not always easy to find especially for elementary teachers and teachers of nonscience subjects. The nonprofit SubjectToClimate is among those working to offer standardsaligned interdisciplinary materials for teachers.   Understanding how a set of resources can be put together in a way that meets your particular needs and addresses standards in a meaningful way is not an easy thing to do Bodor said. Many teachers probably don t feel like they have enough time to assemble resources in a way that will be effective in the classroom.  Twothirds of teachers said creating developmentally appropriate climate change education materials was extremely or very important to support effective teaching about climate change. A similar percentage said the same about the development of teaching materials to bring diverse perspectives such as Indigenous knowledge or those focused on equity into climate change teaching. Half of teachers say they want short videos for climate change education and similar percentages said they want readymade lessons and small group activities. They are also hungry for resources that draw on current events and examples as well as ones that focus on climate resilience and solutions the NAAEE survey found. The NAAEE survey found that most teachers aren t confident that administrators and education policymakers want climate change to be taught.  Just 36 percent said they believe either administrators or state education officials want students to learn that scientists agree climate change is real and humancaused and 33 percent said the same about school board members. Teachers were even more skeptical about parents Just about a quarter said they think parents support teaching the scientific consensus that climate change is real and humancaused. And about half of teachers say they worry about parent complaints when it comes to teaching climate change.  Administrators were even more likely to worry about parent complaints the survey found. But 80 percent of administrators agreed that there is a responsibility to address the problem of climate change and solutions in school. A 2019 poll by NPR and Ipsos found that more than 80 percent of parents in the United States support the teaching of climate change. While Democrats were more likely to support the subject being taught in school Republicans were still largely supportive. However the last few years have brought more intense scrutiny to what s being taught in classrooms and the National Science Teaching Association has said the elimination of teaching about evolution and climate change is a present threat as legislators and local school boards attempt to restrict what materials teachers can use and what they can say in the classroom.

And that support crosses political divides according to the results of an exclusive new NPRIpsos poll Whether they have children or not twothirds of Republicans and 9 in 10 Democrats agree that the subject needs to be taught in school. A separate poll of teachers found that they are even more supportive in theory 86 agree that climate change should be taught. These polls are among the first to gauge public and teacher opinion on how climate change should be taught to the generation that in the coming years will face its intensifying consequences children. Dont see the graphic above? Click here And yet as millions of students around the globe participate in Earth Day events on Monday our poll also found a disconnect. Although most states have classroom standards that at least mention humancaused climate change most teachers arent actually talking about climate change in their classrooms. And fewer than half of parents have discussed the issue with their children. Dont see the graphic above? Click here When it comes to one of the biggest global problems the default message from older generations to younger ones is silence. Laine Fabijanic a mother of three living in Glenwood Springs Colo. says her part of the country is feeling the effects of climate change from an unusually snowless winter last year to scary fires. She and her family recycle and eat organic they are even installing solar panels on the house. About 3 in 4 respondents in our nationally representative survey of 1007 Americans agreed that the climate is changing. That figure is in line with previous results from Ipsos and other polls. Dont see the graphic above? Click here Parents are even more likely than the general public to support teaching students thoroughly about climate change including its effects on our environment economy and society. Among parents with children under 18 84 agree that it should be taught in schools. However parents like Fabijanic arent necessarily holding these conversations themselves. Just 45 of parents said they had ever discussed the topic with their own children. Teachers support teaching climate change more in theory than in practice If they dont hear about it at home will kids learn about climate change in school? To answer this question NPRIpsos also completed a nationally representative survey of around 500 teachers. These educators were even more likely than the general public to believe in climate change and to support teaching climate change. But in practice its more complicated. More than half 55 of teachers we surveyed said they do not cover climate change in their own classrooms or even talk to their students about it. The most common reason given? Nearly twothirds 65 said its outside their subject area. Dont see the graphic above? Click here Lets not forget that teachers are busy and often underresourced and overworked. When asked to rank the importance of climate change it fell to near the bottom of a list of priorities for expanding the curriculum behind science and math basic literacy and financial education. Parents seen as obstacles to teaching climate But there are other factors at work too in the decision of whether to cover climate change. For example almost a third of all teachers say that when it comes to teaching climate change they worry about parent complaints. Dont see the graphic above? Click here In our poll teachers who do not teach the subject were allowed to choose more than one reason. They named many obstacles. Moreover there also seems to be a divide in terms of resources attitudes and support between teachers who cover climate change in their classrooms and those who dont. Mallory Newall of Ipsos said for some teachers maintaining that its not their job to teach climate change may just be a way to rationalize why theyre not talking about it. Thats because teachers who do talk about climate change are also more likely to say In our NPR Ed newsletter we did a callout to teachers to find out more about how they teach climate change. Some teachers we heard from mentioned the divisiveness of the issue and the difficulty in dealing with students whose parents are deniers of climate change. Theres so much political jargon around climate change that I would either have to dismiss their concerns that they bring up or burn a lot of time talking about something that is outside my content area said Jack Erickson a science teacher at Cienega High School in Vail Ariz. in response to our callout. Some teachers get creative in teaching climate change On the other hand about 42 of teachers in our survey said they are indeed finding ways to address climate change in the classroom. In our callout we heard from far more than just science teachers. Preschool English public speaking Spanish statistics social studies teachers even home economics teachers and librarians all are finding ways to approach the topic. The main character Lynn lives in a version of the U.S. where physical water scarcity is the norm. As we read the novel kids made connections between what is happening today and the novel she told NPR. They were very engaged they loved it. They learned so much they didnt know. Debra Freeman teaches family and consumer science what used to be called home economics at McDougle Middle School in Chapel Hill N.C. Her curriculum includes healthy food choices. Harvards T.H. Chan School of Public Health is directly connecting the overconsumption of animal products to our global warming dilemma she says. We also touch on the role of food waste a huge problem in the U.S. and its effect on climate change. Students in middle school are at a pivotal age for developing a multifaceted lens for thinking evaluating and problemsolving. I place great hope in them! Erin Royers mixedage classroom at Steele Elementary School in Denver comprises fourth and fifthgraders. Does she cover climate change in elementary school? Hell yes! she says. If you teach from a problembased learning style students will repeatedly arrive at climate change as the cause and effect of many problemsissues in their world. Whether the topic is animals energy or hurricanes and wildfires When they read information through their research put out by reliable scientists they arrive at climate change again and again. And Lily Sage teaches really little people at the Schuylkill Center for Environmental Educations naturefocused preschool in Philadelphia. Its a little above their heads but we talk about Earth changes and ways we can avoid the ones that are causing mass extinctions. Because dinosaurs are accessible to them that is often the framing for that conversation. State school policies mostly include climate change  Since 2013 19 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Next Generation Science Standards created by a consortium of states and science authorities to strengthen the teaching of science. The standards instruct teachers to cover the facts of humancaused climate change beginning in middle school. According to an analysis done for NPR Ed by Glenn Branch deputy director of the National Center for Science Education 36 states in total currently recognize humancaused climate change somewhere in their state standards. But he says the fact that humancaused climate change is included in a states science standards doesnt mean that teachers in that state do teach it and vice versa. Moreover this year alone there have been numerous bills and resolutions introduced in statehouses that would restrict the teaching of climate change. In Connecticut a recent bill would have cut climate change materials from the states standards. An Iowa bill would have directly repealed the states use of Next Generation Science Standards. Others including in Arizona Maine South Dakota and Virginia would prohibit the teaching of any issue included in a state political party platform on the grounds of antiindoctrination. Floridas bill prescribes balanced teaching for controversial science subjects. While most of these bills were tabled or failed to pass Floridas is still live Branch sees them as part of a concerted and continuing effort to block the teaching of mainstream science. For example some of these bills resemble model legislation created years ago by the American Legislative Exchange Council a group that brings businesses together with lawmakers to write bills that are often industryfriendly. As the political debate continues more and more students dont have to wait to learn about climate impacts in the classroom. Thats because they are experiencing them in their daily lives.

Olivia SunNPR hide caption   High school junior Celeste Palmer holds a burned piece of paper that drifted into her neighborhood during the California Tubbs Fire in 2017. NPR Ed found in an analysis that in just one semester the fall of 2017 for example 9 million U.S. students across nine states and Puerto Rico missed some amount of school owing to natural disasters which scientists say are becoming more frequent and severe because of climate change. The Schools for Climate Action Summit in Washington D.C. in March was instigated by students in Northern California whose communities were ravaged by wildfires. They also brought together students affected by Hurricane Harvey in Houston and by agricultural droughts on tribal lands in New Mexico to lobby at the Capitol. Celeste Palmer a high school junior came to the summit with scraps of burned paper that had drifted into her Santa Rosa Calif. neighborhood from the Tubbs Fire in 2017.

https://www.wbur.org/cognoscenti/2023/07/12/climate-education-crisis-wayland-high-school-sabine-von-mering, Perhaps that s also why a recent NPRIpsos poll suggested that a majority of American parents and teachers want their kids to learn about climate change. But the poll also confirmed that there is hardly any climate education in our schools most teachers arent actually talking about climate change in their classrooms.  I was not at all surprised. If you re right about all this one student at Wellesley High School had said to me after a presentation about climate change not long ago then why aren t they telling us?  His question hit me like a punch in the stomach. Indeed why aren t we? Climate change is going to affect their entire lives. They have a right to know where we are headed. It will not only help them consider their future careers. It will help them survive. And it should not just be science education. Kids need to know more than why it s happening. They need the knowledge and the skills to deal with it too. All disciplines are called upon to help students prepare for what s to come. It s somehow more disturbing that Massachusetts is no exception. Massachusetts a science and biotech center ranked very low in a study of climate change curriculum policy concluded Renee Cho author and regular contributor to the Columbia Climate School earlier this year. Cho pointed to Rabiya Arif Ansari and Jennifer M. Landin s recent study of 57 college biology textbooks published between 1970 and 2019. The experts found that coverage of climate change had actually decreased during that period. As had the focus on solutions to the crisis. No surprise then that our students feel unprepared. Megan O Donnell a recent graduate of Wayland High School WHS devoted her senior project to researching what teachers at WHS are teaching about climate change. Her results show clearly that there is a lot of room for improvement. Unless a student is enrolled in a particular level of chemistry it seems they will not encounter any climate science during their four years of high school. If they happen to be enrolled in a foreign language they may talk about the issue of global warming in French or Spanish. If they have a committed English teacher they will read about it in English class. That s it. Tara Sawrikar a 10thgrade WHS student who also serves as a student member on Wayland s Climate and Energy Committee surveyed WHS students asking them how worried they are about climate change whether they have taken a class or a unit on the subject and what they wish they had learned about it. Of the 38 students who responded the large majority 71 said they were concerned or very concerned and about 66 said they had not encountered a class or unit about the subject. Sawrikar does not claim to have interviewed a representative sample and O Donnell and Sawrikar s interest was spurred by their 8thgrade science teachers. Indeed the Wayland Middle School science curriculum does include a few weeks of climate education at the very end. But there is only so much a single unit in 8th grade can cover. But what hits home the most in Sawrikar s survey results are the students responses to the question about what they wish they had been taught. Everything two of them say. Other answers Anything more about it Maybe some more baseline knowledge like what exactly is happening and why about how bad it really is and what we can do and why it matters. Perhaps now you feel that punch to the stomach too?  If you re right about all this then why aren t they telling us?  It s not like there are no good resources that teachers can incorporate. There s an abundance from NASA to NOAA from the NRDC to National Geographic. There are cool projects like the Vancouverbased Planet Protector Academy. Here in Massachusetts too there are Cooler Communities and the youth education offered by the Mystic River Watershed Association. And universities are beginning to act. My own school Brandeis University has a precollege program for youngsters interested in climate science and activism and we started offering a minor in Climate Justice Science and Society a couple of years ago. Emerson College launched a climate justice initiative this spring. In her final report Megan O Donnell also highlights MIT s Climate Action Through Education program that aims to produce a climate change curriculum for a number of high school subjects. Recently some states have made progress New Jersey was the first state to require climate education and Connecticut will follow next year. Massachusetts should be a leader but is far from it. A couple of bills about improving climate education were proposed this session for example H 470 and H 496 which has the support of the Massachusetts Youth Climate Coalition but they have hardly moved forward since February. Many teachers say they aren t able to fit climate education into the curriculum given the pressures of standardized testing. That s why another bill the Thrive Act supported by the Massachusetts Teachers Association may have the best chance to move us in the right direction. It s not a climate bill but if we reduce teaching to the test that would make climate education easier to fit in. The majority of parents agree that climate literacy should be a priority. You could call not equipping our kids with the knowledge and skills they will need to survive a form of criminal neglect. Make sure your state legislators support these bills. Most importantly talk about climate change with your kids this summer. They deserve to know and it obviously won t help to wait until they re back to school.

There was one minute left on Suzanne Horsley s stopwatch and the atmosphere remained thick with carbon dioxide despite the energetic efforts of her class of third graders to clear the air. Horsley a wellness teacher at Toll Gate Grammar School in Pennington New Jersey had tasked the kids with tossing balls of yarn representing carbon dioxide molecules to their peers stationed at plastic disks representing forests. The first round of the game was set in the 1700s and the kids had cleared the field in under four minutes. But this third round took place in the present day after the advent of cars factories and electricity and massive deforestation. With fewer forests to catch the balls and longer distances to throw the kids couldn t keep up.  That was hard said Horsley after the round ended. In this time period versus the 1700s way more challenging right? Sign up to receive our deeply reported education coverage in your inbox every Tuesday.  In 2022 we got a lot of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere said Horsley. What s the problem with it what is it causing?   Global warming volunteered one girl. Two years ago New Jersey became the first state in the country to adopt learning standards obligating teachers to instruct kids about climate change across grade levels and subjects. The standards which went into effect this fall introduce students as young as kindergarteners to the subject not just in science class but in the arts world languages social studies and physical education. Supporters say the instruction is necessary to prepare younger generations for a world and labor market increasingly reshaped by climate change.  There s no way we can expect our children to have the solutions and the innovations to these challenges if we re not giving them the tools and resources needed here and now said Tammy Murphy the wife of New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy and a founding member of former Vice President Al Gore s Climate Reality Action Fund who pushed to get the standards into schools. Just as students must be able to add and subtract before learning calculus she said kids need to understand the basics of climate change the vocabulary the logic behind it before they can tackle the climate crisis. Related Teaching global warming in a charged political climate Historically climate change has not been comprehensively taught in U.S. schools largely because of the partisanship surrounding climate change and many teachers limited grasp of the science behind it. That started to change in 2013 with the release of new national science standards which instructed science teachers to introduce students to climate change and its human causes starting in middle school. Still only 20 states have adopted the standards. A 2020 report from the National Center for Science Education and Texas Freedom Network Education Fund found that many states that didn t follow the new guidance weren t explicit in their standards about the human causes of climate change and a few even promoted falsehoods about its causes and degree of seriousness. Meanwhile discussion of climate change outside of science class remains relatively rare educators and experts say. New Jersey is trying to change that but it s not a simple task. Like teachers around the country educators here are exhausted after years of Covid disruptions and as elsewhere some schools face dire teacher shortages. On top of this many educators don t feel prepared to teach climate change A 2021 survey of 164 New Jersey teachers found that many lacked confidence in their knowledge of the subject and some held misconceptions about it confusing the problem with other environmental issues such as plastic pollution. For now the climate instruction requirements haven t faced much pushback from climate deniers and conservatives who ve trained their attacks instead on the state s new sexeducation standards. But state officials anticipate some criticism as the lessons begin to roll out in classrooms. A more pressing concern and one that plagues any education initiative because of local control of schools is that the lessons are rolling out unevenly across the state. Schools in affluent towns like Pennington tend to have more time and resources to introduce new instruction schools in poorer communities like Camden that are often the most vulnerable to climate disasters may lack the resources to do so.  I am happy to see New Jersey as a pioneer of climate change standards said Maria SantiagoValentin cofounder of the Atlantic Climate Justice Alliance a group that works to mitigate the disproportionate harm of climate change on marginalized communities. But she said the standards will need to be revised if they fail to adequately emphasize the unequal impact of climate change on Black and Hispanic communities or ensure that students in those communities receive the instruction. Related Are we ready? How we are teaching and not teaching kids about climate change New Jersey is making some effort to help teachers adopt the standards setting aside 5 million for lesson plans and professional development and enlisting teachers like Horsley who holds a master s degree in outdoor education and has a passion for the environment to develop model lessons. Supporters are trying to ensure that teachers have plenty of examples for teaching the standards in ageappropriate ways with racial and environmental justice as one of the key features of the instruction.  It s not like we re asking kindergarteners to look at the Keeling Curve said Lauren Madden a professor of education at the College of New Jersey who prepared a report on the standards referring to a graph showing daily carbon dioxide concentrations. We re trying to point out areas where we can build some of those foundational blocks so that by the time students are in upper elementary or middle school they really have that solid foundation.  On a recent weekday Cari Gallagher a third grade teacher at Lawrenceville Elementary School in central New Jersey was reading to her students the book No Sand in the House! which tells the story of a grandfather whose Jersey Shore home is devastated by Hurricane Sandy. Later the students sat down to write about what they d heard drawing connections between the book and their own lives world events or other books they d read. After the writing exercise Gallagher directed the students to split into small groups to build structures that would help provide protection against climate change calamities. The kids used Legos blocks PlayDoh and straws to create carports walls and other barriers. That same morning a kindergarten class at the elementary school listened as their teacher Jeffrey Berry held up a globe and discussed how different parts of the world have different climates. Related Climate change is sabotaging education for America s students and it s only going to get worse At Hopewell Valley Central High School in Pennington art teacher Carolyn McGrath piloted a lesson on climate change this summer with a handful of students. The results of the class four paintings featuring climate activists sat on the windowsill of her classroom.   It felt empowering to see people like me who reflect me and my identities said Mackenzie Harsell an 11th grader who d created a portrait of 24yearold climate activist Daphne Frias who like Mackenzie is young and is disabled. This project told me I could do anything.  Research suggests education does have an impact on how people understand climate change and their willingness to take action to stop it. One study found that college students who took a class that discussed reducing their carbon footprint tended to adopt environmentfriendly practices and stick with them over many years. Another found that educating middle schoolers about climate change resulted in their parents expressing greater concern about the problem.  Education is certainly a way that we could have perhaps slowed down where we are right now in terms of the climate crisis said Margaret Wang chief operating officer with SubjectToClimate a nonprofit that is helping teachers develop and share climate lessons. More jobs related to climate change are already opening up said Wang and kids will need skills not just to discover scientific innovations but to tell stories advocate inspire and make public policy. Back at Toll Gate elementary Horsley the wellness teacher was getting ready to hand off the third graders to their classroom teacher. Before filing back into the school a handsome brick building that suffered flooding last year during Hurricane Ida students reflected on the lesson. Ayla a third grader dressed in jeans and tiedye sneakers said it made her want to do something about climate change because I don t want it to get so hot.  Wes another third grader said adults could have done more to protect the environment. I think they ve done a medium job because they re still producing a lot of carbon dioxide and a lot of people are littering still.   I feel bad for the other animals because they don t know about it so they don t know what to do added his classmate Hunter.  We know about it said Abby who was wearing a shirt emblazoned with the words Girl Power. She said it was up to humans to drive less and recycle and protect other species from climate disaster.  When I first found out we were going to learn about climate change in gym I was like that s surprising because normally we learn that in class Abby added. But I m glad we did it in gym she continued. It was really fun.  This story about climate change education was produced by The Hechinger Report a nonprofit independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.
