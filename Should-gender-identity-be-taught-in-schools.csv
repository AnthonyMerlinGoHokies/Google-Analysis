https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueUnpopularOpinion/comments/wnnb4c/gender_ideology_should_not_be_taught_in/,  Here is why I take issue with each of these claims   Children need the assistance of adults to discover their gender I do not agree with this. Children who are experiencing gender dysphoria often indicate this verbally to their parents teachers and peers but gender dysphoria is for the majority of people experiencing it not permanent. Adults should never encourage children to think of their gender in any specific way merely offer them the resources to address it if they express that they are dysphoric. If an elementary school student tells their teacher they are dysphoric they should be referred to the guidance counselor who will determine if they and their parents should be referred to a psychiatrist. The teacher SHOULD NOT tell the child how to think of their own gender teach them any definition of gender nor teach them terminology that they do not know without the authority of the parent because that child may not fully understand what they are experiencing and an adult who capitalizes on that to teach very specific ideologies is not doing right by the child.   It prevents children from being bigoted I also do not agree with this. Children are not less bigoted by teaching them a specific definition of gender they are less bigoted by being taught to respect people who are different from themselves and treat everyone with kindness. It is not the responsibility of the teacher or school to teach a specific definition of gender which is not commensurate with the societallyaccepted definition without the consent of the parent.   The parent cannot know anything about the curriculum because they may be unsafe I also doubt this very much. Teachers are required to report abuse even if only suspected to child protection services and if they truly believed that the parent would be abusive to the child on the basis of their gender identity or make the child unsafe they would not actually allow the child to go back home with the parent.   In no way do I actually believe that teaching gender ideology in schools is for the benefit of the children despite many claims to the opposite. Children who are 5 6 and 7 years old do not understand gender or sexual orientation because these are facets of our being which are not fully understood at that age. I fully believe teachers who are intent on teaching a specific definition of gender to highly impressionable children are looking for any excuse to do so and gaslighting us all into believing it necessary for the benefit of the children. In fact it is an abuse of authority to try to influence a child s perception of their sexual orientation or gender identity especially at that age and it is extremely inappropriate to hide this from the parent. 
https://www.parkwayschools.net/domain/2376,  Higher Expectations. Brighter Futures.  1. Why should my child learn about gender at school? School is a place where children are taught to respect one another and to learn to work together regardless of their differences. Learning about gender diversity is part of that work. Creating a more tolerant inclusive and accepting school environment teaches all children to recognize and resist stereotypes. We teach children to stand up for others to resist bullying and to work together. We also know that many children whose gender is seen as different than what is expected of them can face very difficult circumstances. Too often teasing bullying and violence are a common experience for a gender expansive child. A growing number of school districts and states 17 as of 2014 specifically prohibit bullying and harassment of students based on Gender expression or identity. Further various federal state and municipalprotections further protect these rights. In most cases these protections call for proactive education and training to help students understand gender diversity more fully. 2. Isn t my child too young to be learning about gender? Children are already learning about it. Messages about gender are everywhere and children receive very clear messages about the rules for boys and girls as well as the consequences for violating them. By learning about the diversity of gender children have an opportunity to explore a greater range of interests ideas and activities. For all children the pressure of doing gender correctly is greatly reduced creating more space for them to discover new talents and interests. Whether in or out of school children will encounter other children exhibiting wide ranges of gender expression. This is normal and with a little reflection we can all recognize it as something we encountered during our own childhoods. Tomboys or shy sensitive boys are commonly recognized examples of children who buck societal expectations of gender expression. These children and all children deserve a safe supportive learning environment in which they can thrive and empower themselves. 3. If you are talking about gender aren t you discussing reproduction and sexuality? The simple answer is no. When we discuss gender we talk about what people like to wear the activities they engage in and how they feel about themselves. This is not sexuality. Sexuality involves physical intimacy and attraction. Gender is about selfidentity. Gender identity is a person s internal sense of where they fit on the gender spectrum. This includes all kids typically gendered or not. If responding to questions that arise about physical sex the discussion uses phrases such as private parts and even if anatomical terms come up nothing specific to human reproduction or sexuality is taught. For the most part children are simply not raising these questions. While as adults we struggle to separate the ideas of gender and sexuality primarily because many were taught that they are one and the same children have an ability to grasp the complexity of gender diversity because sexuality does not factor in to complicate their understanding. 4. Ideas about gender diversity go against the values we are instilling in my child at home. Are you trying to teach my child to reject these values? Absolutely not. Our children encounter people with different beliefs when they join any community. While one aim for learning about diversity is to become more accepting of those around us not everyone is going to be best friends. That does not mean however that they can t get along and learn together. The purpose of learning about gender diversity is to demonstrate that children are unique and that there is no single way to be a boy or a girl. If a child does not agree with or understand another student s gender identity or expression they do not have to change how they feel inside about it. However they also do not get to make fun harass or harm someone either. Gender diversity education is about teaching students to live and work with others it comes down to the simple agreement that all children must be treated with kindness and respect. 5. Won t my child get confused if we speak about more than two gender options? Studies show that with enough information children of any age are able to understand that there are more than the two gender categories currently recognized by our society. When it is explained to them in a simple age appropriate manner gender diversity is an easy concept for children to grasp. When you discuss gender with your child you may hear them exploring where they fit on the gender spectrum and why. This shows that they understand that everyone may have some variation of gender expression that fits outside of stereotypical norms. Their use of language or their personal placements along this spectrum may surprise you. We encourage all parents to approach these discussions with an air of openness and inquiry. 6. Don t Genderexpansive kids have lots of problems? Is gender nonconformity a product of abuse emotional problems neglect divorce detached or overinvolved parents? No. While it is true that some Transgender and gender nonconforming people do experience a tremendous amount of societal abuse and parental rejection this is not the cause of their gender identity or expression. As a result when not supported children whose gender expression or identity is considered atypical often suffer from loneliness lower selfesteem and other negative feelings. Statistics reveal the devastating impact these young people face when placed into a nonsupportive or hostile setting.A genderexpansive child s emotional distress is a response to the mistreatment they have likely faced from those around them. It is not at all uncommon to see a genderexpansive or transgender child s distress greatly reduce or disappear when provided with a more positive environment. 7. Won t allowing children to express nontraditional genders cause them to be teased or harassed? While there is a great deal of data suggesting that genderexpansive young people do face teasing there is a growing body of knowledge that points to the impact genderexpansive education can have on reducing that treatment. If children are being treated badly because of who they are the answer is not to try and prevent them from being themselves. Rather we should instead ask whether it is worth expanding students understanding about stereotypes and limitations of self expression to prevent possible teasing. 8. Won t discussing gender encourage my child to be transgender? Being transgender is not something that a person chooses. Studies show that although parents cannot make their child gay or transgender they can deeply influence how their children feel about themselves. Parental pressure to enforce gender conformity can damage a child s self esteem and is a high predictor of negative health outcomes and risktaking behaviors for youth. Transgender youth currently have an extremely high attempted suicide rate some estimate it being as high as 50. Discussing gender will have the effect of removing much of the pressure students face to fit into narrowly defined expectations that few if any can actually meet. 9. If transgender people are so normal why are some families so private about it?A family with a transgender child will decide together how much they wish to share with others. Many children prefer to live their lives as the gender that reflects their internal gender identity and not adhere to what society expects based on their anatomy. In other words a child who lets her parents know that she is a girl even though she has male on her birth certificate may choose to live her life as a female. Some children and families are open and share this with everyone in their lives. Others choose to maintain a sense of complete privacy while still others find a blend of these two approaches. In most families this decision will be determined jointly by the child and guardians often in collaboration with a medical mental health or other professionals experienced in this area. If a family honors their child s wish for privacy this can have the appearance of secrecy. In reality it may be an effort to avoid potential stigmatization or to simply keep a very personal topic private. 10. How can I correct or modify the impression I have already given my child about gender?It is powerful to share with children when we don t know the answer to something and to let them know that adults as well as children are always learning. Having conversations with your children that reflect your growing understanding is wonderful. It does not undermine your parenting. If you were to discover that you had unknowingly taught your child another form of misinformation about other people you would correct the impression you had mistakenly given them. With gender it is no different. Gender diversity is something that both society and science are just beginning to explore and understand. 11. I don t really feel like I know how to answer my child s questions.Once again explain that you are learning about this too. It is important however to monitor and understand your own feelings before you initiate this kind of conversation. Children can pick up on your feelings towards a subject. So if you are still feeling uncomfortable about the concept of gender diversity then consider taking additional time to increase your understanding. Read talk to others and further educate yourself. When you have a greater understanding and increased awareness then you will likely feel more confident to talk with your children. Answer children s questions simply and let them take the lead in how deep the conversation goes. Most children are satisfied with this approach. They will guide the conversation from there and rarely ask the complex questions that occur to adults. You may be surprised at how simply children navigate this terrain. Some parents have found responses such as Hmmm I am just learning about that myself. Let me tell you what I know and then if you would like to learn more maybe we could do that together to be helpful in opening up pathways for further discussion.  555 S.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/how-to-teach-gender-identity-in-schools/671422/,  Resources and lesson plans for those who want to teach about gender identity are becoming much more common The Washington Post reported in June. Seven states now require that curriculums include LGBTQ topics. The National Sex Education Standards developed by experts and advocacy groups name gender identity as one of seven essential topics alongside puberty consent sexual orientation and other subjects. And the federal government recommends that schools include gender identity in their sex education programs.  The push is to start young. California s Department of Education urges kindergarten teachers to dispel gender stereotypes laying groundwork for acceptance inclusiveness and an antibullying environment because some children in kindergarten or even younger have identified as transgender. Some educators favor earlier interventions. The eight coauthors of the 2019 book Supporting Gender Diversity in Early Childhood Classrooms argue that too little emphasis is given to gender identity in the years before age 6 when educators have a chance to prime all parents for supporting their children s gender health and the opportunity to educate all children about gender diversity and introduce them to role models of a variety of genders.  But a rival faction has reacted by insisting at the other extreme that instruction involving gender identity has no place at all in earlychildhood education. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis signed a law in March that prohibits public schools from presenting any instruction on gender identity until at least the fourth grade. According to NPR at least a dozen other states are considering similar legislation. The issue could be a political winner for the Republicans who are pushing it. A recent survey sponsored by the American Federation of Teachers finds that 58 percent of likely voters in battleground states disapprove of the way students are taught about sexual preference and gender identity. Asked to explain why 31 percent said students are too young for the material while 27 percent said parents are responsible for teaching it. Read Want to understand the redstate onslaught? Look at Florida. Some progressives believe that any such concern among parents is a moral panic driven by Fox News demagogues or the Twitter account Libs of TikTok which amplifies the most selfdiscrediting videos that leftist educators post online. By nutpicking on this issue rightwing media does create misleading impressions. To better understand what is actually being taught or what bans are prohibiting I turned to EvanstonSkokie School District 65 a publicschool system in the Chicago suburbs that is is laudably transparent about posting instructional material online. Last year I reported on its Black Lives Matter at School curriculum. Its educators also post the lessons that they teach starting in prekindergarten during the district s LGBTQ Equity Month. Gender identity is a major focus of the curriculum which I should note is similar to curricula I ve seen elsewhere from progressive educators. The District 65 instructional materials reveal a basic problem. Although American society s approach to matters of gender identity is clearly still in flux and reasonable people disagree on how best to engage students on the subject some educators are writing progressive activists views into detailed lessons for young children. An alternative approach might promote inclusion in the broadest plainest possible terms and reassure children There s no wrong way to be you. Instead District 65 and other systems err on the side of saying too much and mistaking dogma for established fact. To be clear I favor some instruction on gender identity. When I asked Atlantic readers last spring about what if anything minors should be taught about gender identity before puberty some of the most compelling responses convinced me that you re inevitably teaching young kids something about gender the minute you create say a preschool facility with boys and girls bathrooms. Very young kids receive countless signals about gender norms from the world at large from parents siblings television even a trip to the park or the supermarket and school cultures teach similar lessons from the start. One of my correspondents a 19yearold queer woman named Zoe noted that boys never wore dresses to her school even in hot weather and recalled that as early as first grade she was asked which boy she liked. To stay silent about gender in early childhood she argued simply educates on this subject the way a dog may learn of the location of a newly installed electric fence by receiving a shock anytime they dare cross a border they didn t know existed until they learn to stay firmly within the bounds.  That s a good description of how kids who didn t conform to prevailing gender norms felt in the classrooms of my youth. Although nothing was explicitly taught about gender identity a hundred tiny decisions implicitly acculturated kids into 1980s gender norms including the sense that being genderqueer was shameful a sense that exacerbated the sadistic bullying that too many queer kids in every generation are forced to endure. But while embracing many of the diversityaffirming values that I favor in public schools the District 65 curriculum gives ideological goals precedence over what is ageappropriate. For example in prekindergarten five days of lessons are set forth all oriented around the LGBTQ Pride flag. Students learn its history each color s meaning and how to make their own artsandcrafts version with rainbow colors plus black and brown stripes to represent people of color. After reading Pride The Story of Harvey Milk and the Rainbow Flag the teacher provides some definitions As you heard in the story sometimes people who look the same love each other and sometimes people who look different love each other. Boys can love boys girls can love girls people can love people. When a boy loves another boy they can be called gay and when a girl loves another girl they can be called a lesbian or lesbians. When a boy loves a girl they are called straight. When someone is not a boy or a girl maybe they feel both they are nonbinary or queer. This kind of love is for people not in your family. In my view kids should be taught the fact that some people identify as nonbinary at whatever age they can understand what people who use that label variously mean. At 4 children can likely grasp that there are boys and girls and people who feel like neither. But the District 65 curriculum risks oversimplifying complex matters. A tomboy who feels unlike her female peers might not necessarily be nonbinary instead she might be a masculine girl and that s okay. Nonbinary and queer are not synonyms. To some people the latter word means gay or bisexual to others it broadly includes everyone who is not both cisgender and strictly heterosexual. Meanwhile nonbinary remains a contested term among adults who have thought deeply about gender in society. Some define it in nuanced ways that are hard to explain to young children. The Yale philosophy professor Robin Dembroff for example has described nonbinary as an unabashedly political identity wielded in service of dismantling a mandatory selfreproducing gender system. Some competing theorists are wary of nonbinary because they believe it problematically imposes false gendered assumptions on everyone as if anyone s relationship to gender is fully masculine or feminine. Despite possessing female biology and calling myself a woman I do not consider myself a twodimensional gender stereotype the philosopher Rebecca ReillyCooper writes. Identity as nonbinary person depends upon the existence of a much larger group of socalled binary cisgender people people who are incapable of being outside the arbitrary masculinefeminine genders dictated by society.  I take no position in this larger debate about the merits or demerits of nonbinary and doubt that exposing children to the label will harm them even if they won t understand all its niceties. But I do think that the District 65 curriculum is acculturating kids on one side of an adult debate before they can choose what they think for themselves. The ageappropriate time to instruct on the term is when they can grasp the disagreement about it. Other lessons in the curriculum stray from affirming the dignity of nonbinary and trans people to teaching contested and in some cases contradictory claims about the nature of gender. One kindergarten lesson calls for teachers to read I Am Jazz My Princess Boy and Jack Not Jackie all books about trans or genderqueer kids. The following day s lesson introduces another important flag that has just 3 colors light blue pink and white. The ensuing script reads People who identify as TRANSGENDER have their own ways of dressing playing acting that might not be what you expect. They might look to you like a boy but dress and act like a girl.  But wait How does a girl dress and act? By day five of the school district s LGBTQ Equity Month the kindergarteners have been taught that there are no such thing as boys toys and girls toys or boys clothes and girls clothes any boy can wear a dress and any girl can play with toy trucks. But then when introducing terms such as trans and nonbinary the curriculum relies on and arguably reaffirms gender stereotypes. For example kindergarten students are shown a slide meant to represent a boy a girl and a nonbinary person. Its symbols are silhouettes of stereotypical male dress stereotypical female dress and a mashup of the two An image from District 65 s kindergarten curriculum for LGBTQ Equity Month Evanston Skokie School District 65If you tell 5yearolds that boys can wear dresses and play with dolls just as much as girls but also that Michael feels like a girl so from now on he s going to wear dresses and play with dolls act like a girl? you ve undercut the message that normative gender stereotypes are bogus. The curriculum goes on to promulgate the current politeness norms of highly educated progressives. In first grade students are introduced to gender pronouns through the children s book They She He Easy as ABC. The somewhat familiar pronoun ze is introduced as are more bespoke possibilities. On one page Diego drums and dances. Tree has all the sounds tree is Diego s preferred pronoun. For a character named Sky all of the pronouns are right. Soon students are prompted to choose their own pronouns. Whatever pronouns you pick today you can always change! the script for the teacher states. But remember that it is important to tell somebody to call you what you want to be called. Some kids may receive this exercise as a new opportunity to feel more accepted for who they are. Others may try to fit themselves into boxes they only dimly understand. Kids can struggle with too little conceptual structure as surely as too much and one wonders whether suggesting the pronoun tree whatever that signifies serves them well. Read Where genderneutral pronouns come from Is the progressive uppermiddleclass Gen Z teen approach to pronouns a new norm that will be with us henceforth because it makes society more inclusive? Or will the next generation find this approach stifling or unworkable or problematically essentialist as some feminist commentators do? I don t know so my instinct is to wait for kids to develop their own norms around pronouns. Other parts of the curriculum describe reality in inaccurate and ideologically charged ways. Second grade begins with a video featuring a grandfather who is confused when his grandchild says her nonbinary friend is coming over. The family explains what that means to Grandpa. The accompanying script for teachers includes this statement  A lot of people believe babies are given the gender that they are when they are born but we now know gender is a spectrum. When couples find out they are pregnant they have something called a gender reveal party. But really it should be called a sex assigned at birth party!  The notion that sex is something doctors assign rather than record at birth recurs in several places in the lessons. But this is misleading. A baby born with a penis testicles and a Y chromosome and without a vagina is male even if that baby is born in a forest far from any doctor or nurse or at a hospital to a doctor who erroneously records the sex as female. Recognizing that some children s gender identity differs from their biological sex does not require any insinuation that their sex was assigned thoughtlessly or that it is socially constructed. Subsequently secondgrade students are introduced to the story of Cinderella and are encouraged to focus on stereotypes around gender attraction and race. Suggested questions include the following How would the story be different if Cinderella had short hair and wore jeans and tennis shoes to the ball? How would she be treated? Why? Who is included in this book and who isn t included in this book? Are the characters in this book culturally similar to one another or is this a diverse community? The next day the teacher announces to students that as a class they are going to rewrite Cinderella to make it more inclusive relevant and less sexist. In the District 65 curriculum nontraditional gender roles are affirmed as presumptively liberatory responses to oppressive social norms traditional gender roles like a young woman wearing a dress and pretty shoes to a ball are problematized and deconstructed rather than being affirmed as equally valid identities. To read the District 65 curriculum as a whole is to see one group of progressives repeatedly advancing their widely contested beliefs about gender identity as though they are fact. Amid so many competing theories and preferences many of them relatively new I oppose indoctrinating kids into any one viewpoint regardless of whether the one being reified is Catholic or evangelical or feminist or Muslim or gendercritical or queertheorist or individualist or that of an LGBTQ activist. Why should educators adopt any one faction s understanding of sex and gender? Publicschool districts in a democratic society cannot just decide that one activist faction s favored approach to matters of sexual and gender identity is correct and then impose that view. One way or another school systems have to reckon with the preferences of the communities they serve. In fact in most places if educators imbue their lessons with the cutting edge of queer theory many who d accept the lessons that humans vary in how they express their genders and that everyone ought to be respected will decide no instruction at all is preferable. Fortunately there is a lot of middle ground between the most progressive activist approaches to teaching gender identity and the overly censorious state laws that would ban the subject entirely. If a girl at the public school nearest you tells her preschool teacher I want to play with the toy soldiers and wear a football jersey to school but the others say I can t because I m a girl the teacher could respond Don t worry you just be you. Play and dress however you like there s no wrong way to be a girl. Alternatively the teacher could respond Don t worry you just be you. Play and dress however you want and maybe you ll decide that you re a boy or nonbinary. Or the teacher could simply say Don t worry you just be you because labels are for later. Insofar as there is any position on earlychildhood education that could satisfy most people in the debate or at least mollify everyone enough to achieve compromise that may take the form of insisting on tolerance or even acceptance without being any more prescriptive. This approach would still upset some parents. I suspect however that most people would embrace it in contrast to the District 65 approach to the issue which may be viable in America s most progressive school systems but is not beyond them.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2022/06/03/schools-gender-identity-transgender-lessons/, Sometimes teachers simply shift their language to reflect gender diversity that may be in the room. Instead of Good morning boys and girls! the teacher might say Good morning scholars!  In Florida and several others states educators are restricted in teaching about gender identity but elsewhere teachers are embracing the topic as the number of transgender and gender nonbinary children rises. Resources and lesson plans for those who want to teach about gender identity are becoming much more common. Seven states now require that curriculums include LGBTQ topics. The National Sex Education Standards developed by experts and advocacy groups name gender identity as one of seven essential topics alongside puberty consent sexual orientation and other subjects. And the federal government recommends that schools include gender identity in their sex education programs.  There s years of research that demonstrate that curriculums that include respect for others regarding their sexual orientation and gender identity are more effective said Kathleen Ethier director of the division of adolescent and school health at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That s true not just for LGBTQ students she said. When you make a school environment safe and supportive for the most vulnerable youth you improve the school environment for everyone.  Opponents argue that teaching about gender identity is driven by liberal ideology and is inappropriate for children especially young children. Five states including Florida ban or limit how teachers can talk about gender identity and sexual orientation with at least 10 states considering such measures according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Books that feature transgender or nonbinary characters have been subject to numerous ban attempts. The restrictions often go beyond the classroom. Many districts have resisted efforts to allow transgender students to use the bathroom corresponding to their gender identity and 18 states limit transgender women from competing in women s and girls sports though some measures are on hold pending a court challenge. Philadelphia s school district even came under fire for informing teachers about an independent Trans Wellness Conference where some attendees discussed how to support youth who are transitioning genders. Classes that address gender identity are still the exception in American schools. But an increase in the number of young people identifying as trans or gender nonconforming has prompted many schools to change course and adopt lessons that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. A Gallup survey released last year found 16 percent of young adults in Generation Z identify as LGBT more than any other generation. The approaches vary particularly for elementary schoolchildren. In some classrooms lessons about gender identity focus on gender stereotypes. Students in first grade for instance may be prompted to consider that there are no boy colors or girl colors.  Some classes use the book I Am Jazz the story of a transgender girl. I have a girl brain but a boy body she says. This is called transgender. I was born this way!  A lesson meant for first grade called Pink Blue and Purple comes from a curriculum called Rights Respect Responsibility developed by the activist group Advocates for Youth. It tells students that gender is not a fixed attribute.  You might feel like you re a boy even if you have body parts that some people might tell you are girl parts the teachers are told to say. You might feel like a girl even if you have body parts that some people tell you are boy parts. And you might not feel like you re a boy or a girl but you re a little bit of both. No matter how you feel you re perfectly normal!  The lesson continues with students looking at various toys and assessing if each best suits boys girls or anyone. Through discussion the teacher helps students understand that all the toys dolls drums paints helicopters are for anyone. New Title IX rules set to assert rights of transgender students In his kindergarten classroom one teacher in western Massachusetts using Rights Respect Responsibility introduces the idea of gender as part of an exploration of identity. He explains that people use all sorts of pronouns he she they ze. He introduces the terms transgender and gender queer but doesn t fully define them because that is too much for kindergartners said the teacher who spoke on the condition of anonymity because his district did not authorize him to speak publicly. He talks to students about anatomy but declines to classify various body parts as male or female. We don t say a penis belongs to a man he said. It belongs to a human he explains. And he makes clear that even if a doctor proclaims at birth It s a boy! that baby may not be a boy. Someone who was born a boy may not feel they are a boy.  Similar lessons are offered in older grades in his school building in sophistication as children get older. Others take a more moderate approach. Kara Haug who teaches sex ed in several Sacramentoarea elementary schools does not bring up the question of gender identity in her classes which are mostly grades five or six. But she said her pupils often ask about it and she will answer. Once for instance a student asked Can we stop our periods if we don t want them because we feel like a boy? So she explained how hormones work. Another curriculum called HealthSmart obliquely addresses gender identity in fifth grade in the context of respect for oneself and others. Students read stories about children their age and discuss whether the characters seem to be boys or girls or whether it s unclear. They read about a child who is bullied because of gender expression and then create a text message campaign to encourage their peers to accept and respect diversity. HealthSmart explores the subject more directly in middle school where body parts are presented in a genderneutral way It might refer to a body with a penis for instance rather than specifying that boys have penises. People are referred to as partners not boyfriends or girlfriends.  There s a real push to be inclusive of all students said Suzanne Schrag senior curriculum editor at ETR which publishes the HealthSmart curriculum. She said gender identity was not discussed in the previous version of the HealthSmart curriculum published in 20122013 but was added in a 2020 update. In high school some teachers are more direct. Sam Long a transgender man who teaches biology at Denver South High School said he regularly discusses gender identity in his classes.  LGBTQ identities are a naturally occurring facet of human variation and that is why we need to learn about them in the context of biology and human anatomy he said. Long encourages students to consider that gender on a spectrum is an alternative to thinking of gender as a binary. At the start of each year he talks about his own personal story and transition. Bill Farmer a science teacher in Evanston Ill. takes a similar approach. Like Long he teaches about people with intersex traits those born with reproductive or sexual anatomy who do not fit a traditional male or female binary. And he introduces the idea that gender is a social construction not a biological fact. He teaches that there are three separate identities biologic sex or what sex organs one has at birth gender identity or what gender one identifies with and gender expression meaning how one presents to the world. So a student might paint his fingernails a typically female gender expression but still identify as a boy.  There s not many spaces where students have the opportunity to engage in these discussions in a more structured way and where there s a safe space to ask questions he said. He added that there are at least one or two trans or nonbinary students in each of his classes more than ever before. Most students are testing out or trying to figure out where they fall in their gender identity.  Out of 10 biology teachers at his school he estimated that four or five talk about these issues in class. In Maryland officials at the Education Department included gender identity in the statewide standards that were recently adopted for sex ed. But that doesn t mean all teachers will teach these topics said Lea Jaspers who helped write the plan. The framework calls for instruction to represent all students regardless of gender identity and other factors but as a matter of practice each district decides for itself how to teach the subject. Jaspers thinks it s mostly used in schools where a student has identified as transgender and she said one of the goals was to be sure those lessons were stateapproved for teachers who need them.  The framework is very comprehensive so a teacher could never say We are not allowed to say that she said. Due to the politics the landscape remains a patchwork with most students not exposed to these ideas said Melanie WillinghamJaggers executive director of GLSEN which advocates for LGBTQ students in K12 schools.  One district might have a safe and affirming and inclusive curriculum she said. Another across the way could be having a vastly different experience It s deeply uneven.  Sometimes schools add these lessons because they become aware of a particular student grappling with identity questions and want them and their peers to feel comfortable. In other cases the lessons reflect a changing culture where these subjects are considered less taboo and where school leaders want kids who haven t yet realized they might be LGBTQ to come out in a supportive climate. Kahn said the number of training requests from schools have nearly doubled in the last year with about half coming because they became aware of one or more student who is transgender or nonbinary. Nonetheless while these lessons appear to be more common they are far from universally accepted and lessons seen as too explicit or aimed at young children often face blowback. Conservatives argue that inclusive curriculums pose a special challenge. Lessons in schools amounts to cult grooming and ideological grooming in which students are taught that their gender is fluid and can be changed said James Lindsay a conservative activist who has advised legislators on measures dealing with gender and race. The rise in children identifying as transgender or gender nonbinary he argued is being driven by a culture that introduces the idea to children who might never have adopted it on their own.  The message is if you dress or act a certain way you might not be the sex you are he said. When I was a child I wanted to grow up to be a firetruck. Children do not always know exactly what is going on in the world and they need some strong boundaries to protect them.  In Maine Gov. Janet Mills D removed a video where a teacher explains gender identity to kindergartners from the state s education department website after the Maine Republican Party began airing an ad attacking the governor for it. In the video the teacher says that sometimes doctors make a mistake when they tell parents whether their newborns are boys or girls.  A review of the video led the Department to conclude that the lesson is not something we would recommend including as part of kindergarten instruction and as such has been removed from the site spokesman Marcus Mrowka said in a statement. The teacher Kailina Mills replied that she was disappointed by the move. The Maine Department of Education and Mills administration caved to pressure instead of standing up for some of the most vulnerable people families and students in Maine she said in a statement. In New Jersey statewide standards for teaching sex ed are set to take effect this fall. They include discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity. One school system caused a stir when it presented a possible firstgrade curriculum that explained to first graders that some boys may not feel like boys even if they have body parts that some people might tell you are boy parts.  Gov. Phil Murphy D responded by ordering a review of the guidelines and said some lesson plans do not accurately reflect the spirit of the standards.  The state education department then issued a clarification that discussion of gender identity should involve gender stereotypes math isn t just a boy subject for instance. It added They should also help children to understand that every person deserves respect no matter their identity or expression.

A history teacher skipped over PowerPoint slides about the fight for gay rights during a lesson on the civil rights movement. Another English teacher hinted that Oscar Wilde was you know instead of saying he was gay while teaching The Picture of Dorian Gray. Queer symbolism throughout the text went unmentioned.  To 17yearold Aneshka who asked that their last name be withheld these were all indications that a new law requiring teachers to notify parents about lessons on gender and sexuality had had an effect at their eastern Tennessee high school. The omissions and hint hint nudge nudge approach frustrated Aneshka who identifies as queer and uses they and she pronouns.  It felt kind of like turning something that s a fact of history and life and my life into something secret or taboo Aneshka said. It was very much like this odd sense of So am I not allowed to mention myself?  Also read Rising tide of censorship and scrutiny has schools scrambling to avoid backlash While a Florida law that prohibits lessons in kindergarten through third grade about sexual orientation and gender identity has drawn national attention in recent weeks several other states have imposed similar restrictions. On Friday Alabama s governor signed a law like Florida s that bans instruction about those same topics for students in kindergarten to fifth grade. Montana Tennessee and Arkansas all passed laws last year that require schools to give families advance notice of lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation and allow parents to opt their children out.  Ohio Louisiana and South Carolina are considering restrictions like Florida s. And lawmakers in Oklahoma and Tennessee have introduced proposals that would go further restricting teaching on LGBTQ issues in a history or English class for example though neither bill has advanced. Already these curriculum laws are affecting the choices some educators are making in their classrooms leaving them and their students unsure about how to talk about LGBTQ content. The result is that sometimes it gets avoided altogether. Follow Chalkbeat on Twitter and read all our national education news on Facebook. Coupled with other efforts like those seeking to remove books from school libraries that include themes of sexuality and gender it s a climate that s left many students and educators feeling a sense of whiplash.   They honestly are so overwhelmed said Nashville teacher Cassie Norton of her students.  Norton cosponsors her high school s GSA club where students gather to talk about gender and sexuality. Watching a slew of laws pass in quick succession including a law that restricts teaching about race and racism and another law that restricts transgender students access to certain school bathrooms left the students in the club feeling frustrated and isolated.  By making it harder to have conversations in the general classroom environment it s making those issues worse Norton said. Proponents of these measures have said it should be up to parents to decide when and how to teach their children about LGBTQ topics. And lawmakers who support these teaching restrictions have argued that elementary school students are too young to learn about sexual orientation and gender identity in class.   We don t need to be teaching young children about sex said Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey when she signed the state s new law. We need to focus on what matters core instruction like reading and math.  Many students school staff and LGBTQ rights advocates have vocally opposed these curriculum restrictions saying they could lead to incomplete and inaccurate lessons make some students afraid to talk about themselves or their families in class and exacerbate mental health disparities that already exist for LGBTQ youth.  While Montana s legislation was being debated for example several high school students and recent graduates said they worried the restrictions would make it harder to access factual information at school about topics like healthy relationships and consent. There is already a gap in the curriculum around comprehensive sex ed and this bill makes that gap a gaping hole said Clara Bentler a University of Montana student who graduated from high school in Billings in testimony to Montana lawmakers. These issues are not new there have been decadeslong arguments about what children should learn about gender and sexuality in school but observers say this moment is notable because of the number of proposals and the speed at which they re spreading. Federal education officials have said they re watching for potential federal civil rights violations. Related article Biden vs. GOP states Where will the battle over transgender rights leave students? Some educators in states with these laws now find they re being extra careful when LGBTQ issues come up at school. One contemporary issues teacher in Tennessee said she added a disclaimer to her syllabus to let students and parents know the class would touch on topics like gender and sexuality. When Norton taught students about the civil rights movement in U.S. history class this year she let them pick which parallel movement they wanted to research on their own and made it an option to learn about LGBTQ protests during the Stonewall uprising so it didn t require a form. And when Norton taught about President Reagan and the AIDS epidemic she sent students home with the entire text of the state history standard to show the lesson was required. At Aneshka s high school for example GSA club members had plans to host an ally week to teach their classmates about how they could support their LGBTQ peers. They found a short PBS video that provided tips and compiled a list of resources. Then they asked their principal if they could share those tools during the school s advisory period.  But the principal told the students it wouldn t be possible because there wasn t enough time to provide parents with the legally required 30 days notice. So instead Aneshka and other GSA members held smaller optional events after school and during lunch.  It s definitely a lot more impactful than I thought but in a much quieter way Aneshka said of Tennessee s law. She d expected some visible fuss and some bureaucratic mess with extra permission slips. But the reality has been just like silence.  State education officials in Montana Arkansas and Tennessee have left it to local school districts to carry out their state s laws about lessons on gender identity and sexual orientation. None issued guidance to schools and none track how often parents are notified about these lessons or how often they opt out.  Both the Arkansas and Tennessee laws say teachers can mention the sexual orientation or gender identity of a historical or public figure without an optout form if it provides necessary context during a lesson. Teachers can also answer students questions on those matters if they re tied to a class discussion. In Florida the new law requires that lessons about sexual orientation and gender identity for students above third grade must be age appropriate or developmentally appropriate and in line with state standards. But who decides that is up for debate and the state has until June 2023 to provide guidance.  That s left teachers trying to figure out the limits of these laws on their own creating a climate in which some teachers worry that if they say the wrong thing they could lose their job.  Anita Hatcher Powderly who teaches sixthgrade English in Jackson County Florida and is part of a federal lawsuit challenging the Florida law has already seen some evidence of that.  Shortly after Florida s law passed her schools sixth graders lined up to board school buses for a field trip. At first there were going to be separate buses for boys and girls. But one transgender student who wasn t out to all their teachers and classmates looked baffled about where to sit. Two of her colleagues looked at me like What do we say? Hatcher Powderly said. Before anyone could step in it was announced there was only one bus so it would be mixedgender. But the scenario left Hatcher Powderly concerned.  If we say the wrong thing now is it going to be retroactive against us? she said. How do we comfort this child how do we provide inclusivity how do we provide equity?  When elementary schoolers turn to Nashville counselor Alyssa McGuire on issues related to gender or sexuality she still does her best to help. Now though the fear it could cost her her job hangs over her like a constant cloud.  Recently a few female third graders at McGuire s school told their classmates they were interested in being in a relationship with another girl. The girls got teased by their classmates and wanted McGuire to help them understand what was happening. They had lots of questions.  They were like a lesbian s not bad right? McGuire recalled. Am I allowed to say that? Can I be a lesbian?  McGuire talked to them about how people can label themselves in different ways. She would rather risk a parent complaining and give her students the words to describe how they feel she said than make the girls feel dismissed.   There are times when I think about the law and think about the policy and I decide I don t care what the law says I m just going to help my student because that s the priority McGuire said. But it s just sad that that s even a thing I have to think about.  Kalyn Belsha is a national education reporter based in Chicago. Contact her at kbelshachalkbeat.org.

But as Americans began to see through the stilted headlines about the socalled Don t Say Gay bill they scratched their heads and became disturbed by how eager many seemed to defend teaching gender identity to kids in grades K3. But amidst all the hyperbole and hyperventilation the bill s opponents overlooked the kicker clause. The law outright forbade instruction about gender identity in grades K3 but it stipulated that for other grades it must merely be developmentally appropriate. But last week the Florida Board of Education issued a regulation stating that teaching about gender identity is never developmentally appropriate except for in health classes that students can opt out of. Once again Florida has changed the terms of a national culture war debate. The question is no longer whether young children should be taught about gender identity rather the question is should schools teach it at all? If by teaching about gender identity one means presenting gender theory as fact then the answer is certainly no. Gender theory asserts a sectarian truth claim and one which most Americans do not believe. We as a society have long decided that public schools may not teach children sectarian truth claims even those that a majority do believe. Our schools may not teach for instance that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who died for our sins and that through faith in him their souls will be saved. So too our schools should not teach that everyone has a gendered soul distinct from and not necessarily related to their physical body which compels moral deference and affirmation by society upon one s mere declaration that it is so. But given the novelty and pervasiveness of the transgender phenomenon there is a strong case for teaching the scientific and sociological facts about it. Schools teach about the paradigmshattering insights of great scientists how Galileo pioneered the heliocentric model of the solar system how Newton intuited the theory of gravity and so forth. Perhaps schools should teach about the origin of gender identity theory and tell the story of Dr. John Money. Money claimed that because individuals with sexual development disorders could be brought up as either gender gender was therefore a social construct distinct from biological sex. This theory took the scientific community by storm. But one young scientist pointed out two inconvenient facts 1 Money s conclusion did not flow logically from his premise and 2 Money had no experimental evidence to substantiate his claim. Money then conducted an experiment on male twins one of whose genitals had been burned off in a freak circumcision accident. Money persuaded the parents to raise that child as a girl and then published results claiming that his experiment was a striking success. This cemented the status of the gender identity thesis in the scientific community. Money s results however were fraudulent. The child who was raised as a girl experienced severe psychic distress and desisted. Later both twins tragically committed suicide. The revelation of Money s fraud however did not dent the theory s credibility within the scientific community. Depending on the grade level teachers who teach about the origin of gender identity theory could choose whether to mention that Money allegedly coerced the twins to perform sex acts on each other and took pictures of it. The CDCendorsed Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education recommend that schools present fifth graders with information about puberty blockers. And perhaps that is appropriate so long as it is done in a balanced and comprehensive way. Children could be taught that the most popular pubertyblocking drug was long used to chemically castrate sex offenders and that blockers can cause permanent bone density problems mood disorders seizures brain swelling and cognitive impairment. They should learn that this drug has not been approved by the FDA for use with children experiencing gender dysphoria. And they should learn that those who take puberty blockers almost invariably progress to take crosssex hormones which can prevent those taking them from ever experiencing sexual satisfaction sterilize them and keep them hooked on synthetic hormones for life. There is also a fascinating lesson to be learned in international comparative science. Children could be taught that after countries such as Sweden Finland and the United Kingdom conducted scientific reviews of the medical evidence surrounding transgender procedures on children they all decided that because the evidence of harm was clear and the evidence of any benefit shaky such treatments should be confined to rigorously conducted experimental research. By comparison children could be taught that the authorities advising doctors in the United States to pursue these treatments have conducted no such scientific reviews. Rather teachers should point out the guidelines endorsed by the American Academy of Pediatricians were designed by a single doctor and apparently were not reviewed or factchecked by anyone else in the organization. Students should also be taught the debate about social contagion. They could read excerpts from Dr. Lisa Littman s study on rapidonset gender dysphoria a previously unknown phenomenon that currently presents in groups of postpubescent girls based on internetaffinity clusters. They should certainly be taught the data about the high rate of comorbid psychiatric issues present in children with gender dysphoria as well as the remarkably high rate of autism among those children. They can review the data and ponder why gender dysphoria is far more common in politically liberal locales than in politically conservative ones. And they should obviously be taught that historically almost all children diagnosed with gender dysphoria became more comfortable with their biological sex once they went through puberty. Public schools should not inculcate any sectarian dogma or expound any doctrine. But they should present students with the facts and information they need to critically examine society and arrive at their own conclusions. There is a strong argument that straightforward factbased balanced instruction regarding gender identity issues has a proper place in public school curricula. Still one can t help but suspect that when framed as a question of information rather than indoctrination the partisan politics of teaching about gender identity would be totally transformed.
