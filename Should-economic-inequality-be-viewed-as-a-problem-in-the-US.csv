Recent crises have accelerated these divisions and the COVID19 pandemic has deepened them further. Striking McDonald s workers demanding a 15 minimum wage demonstrate in Las Vegas Nevada. Mike SegarReuters Written By Anshu Siripurapu Updated Last updated April 20 2022 514 pm EST Print Email Share Summary Income and wealth inequality is higher in the United States than in almost any other developed country and it is rising. There are large wealth and income gaps across racial groups which many experts attribute to the country s legacy of slavery and racist economic policies. Proposals to reduce inequality include a more progressive income tax a higher minimum wage and expanded educational opportunities. IntroductionIncome and wealth inequality in the United States is substantially higher than in almost any other developed nation and it is on the rise sparking an intensifying national debate. The 2008 global financial crisis the slow and uneven recovery and the economic shock caused by the COVID19 pandemic have deepened these trends and challenged policymakers to respond. Economists say the causes of worsening inequality are complex and include a failure to adapt to globalization and technological change shifting tax policy reduced bargaining power among workers and longstanding racial and gender discrimination. The effects of inequality are similarly varied and they have exacerbated crises such as the pandemic and deepened societal divisions. Inequality can also weaken democracy and give rise to authoritarian movements. President Joe Biden has pledged to reduce economic inequality with new social spending financed by higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations but he faces opposition from those who say his plans go too far.  Inequality   U.S. Economy   COVID19   Globalization   Trade  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office PDF income inequality in the United States has been rising for decades with the incomes of the highest echelon of earners rapidly outpacing the rest of the population. Even among high earners income gains have been heavily skewed toward the top of that bracket.  The growth of CEO pay is illustrative of this trend. In 1965 a typical corporate CEO earned about twenty times that earned by a typical worker by 2018 the ratio was 2781 according to the Economic Policy Institute a progressive think tank. Between 1978 and 2018 CEO compensation increased by more than 900 percent while worker compensation increased by just 11.9 percent.  The picture is much the same when looking at wealth that is total net worth rather than yearly income. In 2021 the top 10 percent of Americans held nearly 70 percent of U.S. wealth up from about 61 percent at the end of 1989. The share held by the next 40 percent fell correspondingly over that period. The bottom 50 percent roughly sixtythree million families owned about 2.5 percent of wealth in 2021.  Moreover inequality in the United States outpaces that of other rich nations. This is captured by the steady rise in the U.S. Gini coefficient a measure of a country s economic inequality that ranges from zero completely equal to one hundred completely unequal. The United States Gini coefficient was forty in 2019 the same as Bulgaria s and Turkey s and significantly higher than that of Canada France and Germany according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD a group of advanced economies.  Recent economic shocks have deepened these trends. The socalled Great Recession from 2007 to 2009 caused incomes to fall and even when they recovered to prerecession levels in 2015 the median income was the same as it was in 2000 70200. The recovery was also unequal by 2016 the top 10 percent had more wealth than they did in 2007 while the bottom 90 percent had less.   Inequality   U.S. Economy   COVID19   Globalization   Trade  Experts say the economic turmoil caused by the COVID19 pandemic including the largest spike in unemployment in modern history will similarly exacerbate inequality. Lowwage workers were far more likely to be laid off and less likely to be rehired though massive government stimulus helped blunt the impact. Meanwhile a boom in stock and home prices primarily benefited wealthy Americans who own more of these assets. Though wages rose at the fastest pace in decades so did prices and this inflation effectively canceled out wage gains.  Inequality is a drag on economic growth and fosters political dysfunction experts say. Concentrated income and wealth reduces the level of demand in the economy because rich households tend to spend less of their income than poorer ones. Reduced opportunities for lowincome households can also hurt the economy. When those at the bottom of the income distribution are at great risk of not living up to their potential the economy pays a price not only with weaker demand today but also with lower growth in the future economist Joseph Stiglitz writes PDF. Recent years have seen the election of populist leaders around the world which some researchers have linked to insecurity caused by economic inequality. Wealthy people can exert outsize influence on the government by financing political campaigns further entrenching their power. A 2020 United Nations report warned that rising inequality is eroding trust in democratic societies and fostering the spread of authoritarian and nativist movements.  We should want to live in a society with a reasonable degree of mobility rather than one where people are born into relative economic positions they can never leave conservative analyst Ramesh Ponnuru wrote in 2015. But so long as those conditions are met the ratio of the incomes of the top 1 percent to the median worker should be fairly low on our list of concerns.  Americans have long prided themselves on the ability to move up the income ladder but there are signs that U.S. economic mobility is disappearing. The fraction of Americans who earn more than their parents has shrunk from more than 90 percent of those born in the 1940s to 50 percent of those born in the 1980s. Harvard University economist Raj Chetty who has studied social mobility extensively found that mobility in the United States varies widely across the country PDF. Some wealthy cities have high mobility on par with countries such as Denmark and Canada while children in some lowerincome areas have less than a 5 percent chance of reaching the top fifth of the income distribution when starting from the bottom fifth. Overall economic mobility is lower in the United States than in many other developed countries which some experts argue hampers U.S. economic growth. In a 2016 Stanford University study PDF the United States ranked behind several other wealthy countries including Australia Canada France Germany and Japan.  The relationship between race ethnicity and inequality has been welldocumented. Since 1960 the median wealth of white households has tripled while the wealth of Black households has barely increased. For decades the unemployment rate among Black Americans has been roughly twice that of white Americans. Black Americans are also underrepresented in highpaying professions including corporate leadership. As of 2020 only four of the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies are Black. Black and American Indian children have far lower economic mobility compared to white Asian and children of Hispanic ethnicity according to Chetty s research. U.S. inequality today is rooted in systemic racism and the legacy of slavery. Through a policy known as redlining that resulted from a New Deal program in the 1930s Black Americans were systematically denied mortgages leading to housing segregation and a disparity in home ownership which is a major source of wealth. Though racial discrimination in housing was banned by the Fair Housing Act of 1968 the effects persist. Black Americans were similarly excluded from the benefits of the G.I. Bill after World War II which is widely credited with helping to grow the middle class. Black Americans also face discrimination in the labor market because hiring is often done internally via networks that exclude them says William E. Spriggs an economics professor at Howard University and the chief economist at the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations AFLCIO. The COVID19 pandemic laid bare many of these disparities. American Indian Black and Latinx Americans were more likely to be hospitalized with and die from COVID19 than white Americans an inequity that CFR s Catherine Powell calls the color of COVID. People of color were more likely to be laid off and they were more likely to be considered essential workers performing jobs that typically came with greater exposure to the virus such as cashiering and package delivery. The existence of a gender pay gap is also wellfounded though there is a debate over its causes. The pay gap has narrowed over the past forty years as women have obtained more education but it has not shrunk as much since 2000 according to the Economic Policy Institute s Elise Gould. Gould attributes this in part to discrimination and the underrepresentation of women in highpaying jobs. Most high wages come from jobs that require a high level of education. In 2016 U.S. families headed by someone with a bachelors degree earned double that of those headed by someone without and families with a postgraduate degree holder earned nearly three times as much according to a 2019 study PDF by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. The share of the nation s income earned by families with at least one bachelor s degree increased from 45 percent to 63 percent between 1989 and 2016. The difference is even starker for net worth. In 2016 families headed by a postgraduate degree holder had nearly eight times more wealth than families without a college degree. In 2015 nearly 25 percent of people without a high school diploma were living in poverty compared to just 5 percent of those with a college degree according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The percentage of Americans with a bachelor s degree has steadily increased since the end of World War II reaching around 38 percent in 2021. The United States is above the OECD average in attainment of higher education but is behind several other wealthy countries including Canada Japan and South Korea.  However college degrees do not guarantee good jobs. Though the college wage premium the percentage by which the wages of college graduates exceed those of high school graduates grew rapidly from 1979 to 2000 it has since fallen off and there is significant income inequality even among college graduates. The Federal Reserve study found that the college wealth premium the increase in net worth from having a degree has declined significantly for white Americans born in the 1980s and has disappeared entirely for Black Americans born that decade. According to the study these diminishing returns could be due to the surging cost of college which has risen by almost triple the rate of consumer price increases since 1978. The top U.S. income tax rates have been repeatedly cut over the past half century which some experts say has contributed to growing inequality. When President John F. Kennedy entered the White House in 1961 the top tax rate was more than 90 percent. Today the top rate stands at 37 percent. The top 1 percent s share of income dramatically increased after President Ronald Reagan slashed taxes in the early 1980s. Likewise the corporate income tax has declined steadily as a share of corporate profits and as a percentage of gross domestic product over the past half century. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 dramatically lowered the corporate rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. The capital gains tax a tax on the sale of assets including stocks land and art has also declined over time though the rate was increased in 2013 to 20 percent. The wealthy generally benefit more from capital gains than from regular employment income leading some experts to argue that the gap between the capital gains tax and the income tax contributes to inequality. Longterm economic forces play a role both by boosting rewards to high earners and undermining wages for low and mediumskill jobs. Those forces experts say include waning worker power increased monopolization of the economy and globalization. Some Americans have greatly benefited from a globalized world whereby they can reach more consumers and manufacture products at lower costs. But globalization has also introduced tough competition for American workers as some jobs were moved overseas and wages stagnated.  The decline of unions is another contributing factor the average union member earns roughly 25 percent more than their nonunion counterpart. In 1983 about 20 percent of all workers were represented by unions. By 2019 that number had dropped to just 6.2 percent. This has disproportionately affected Black workers who historically have been more likely to unionize. However union power is on the rise as the rapid economic recovery from the pandemic has created a tight labor market in which workers have greater leverage. Then there is trade policy a perennial controversy that was supercharged by President Donald Trump s election in 2016. Trump has long been critical of U.S. trade deals claiming that other countries particularly China have taken advantage of the United States to the detriment of U.S. workers. Many economists have disputed the role of trade in manufacturing job losses arguing that such losses were offset by gains in other sectors PDF and that wages have increased as a result of trade. Still others say that technological change including automation is primarily responsible for job losses not trade. In Foreign Affairs former U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer writes that even though trade is not the sole reason jobs have disappeared it cannot be denied that the outsourcing of jobs from high to lowwage places has devastated communities in the American Rust Belt and elsewhere.  Proposals put forward in recent years to address income and wealth inequality have included supporting unionization and raising the minimum wage making the tax code more progressive as well as taxing wealth alongside income and increasing access to education including early education and college. One tool for addressing income inequality that has received significant attention is a more progressive tax code meaning that higher incomes are taxed at a higher rate than lower ones. Some experts and politicians argue that shifting more money from the rich to the poor would reduce inequality and benefit society overall. But others say that higher taxes would stifle economic growth and innovation. Democrats generally subscribe to the former view and Republicans to the latter though some Democratic presidents have cut taxes and some Republican presidents have raised them. The parties positions on taxes have calcified in recent years. Proposed taxes on wealth rather than income have become increasingly popular among Democrats and were championed by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren in the 2020 presidential primary. In March 2022 for the first time as president Biden called for a wealth tax proposing a billionaire minimum income tax in his annual budget request. Households worth more than 100 million would have to pay a tax of at least 20 percent of their income including on socalled unrealized gains from assets such as stocks that have increased in value but have not been sold. Critics challenge the merits of such redistribution arguing that such a tax would be bad for the economy difficult to implement and even unconstitutional.  Biden has also proposed increasing the tax on inherited wealth which is known as the estate tax or to critics as the death tax. While proponents say such a tax would dramatically reduce inequality others argue that it could lead to more tax evasion and discourage investment and entrepreneurship. Biden has also called for raising the corporate tax rate the top income tax rate and the capital gains tax. To address the rising cost of college and increase access to higher education some policymakers including Sanders and Warren have proposed tuitionfree public college and the elimination of student loan debt. Some Republicans including Trump meanwhile have pushed to allocate more federal money toward teaching skills and trades as an alternative. To help close the Black employment gap Howard University s Spriggs suggests making all job postings publicly available using computer algorithms to better match job seekers with job openings and encouraging companies particularly Silicon Valley firms to recruit more Black students. Spriggs also argues for stronger monitoring and enforcement of antidiscrimination laws. Some experts including CFR s Edward Alden say the pandemic should compel Washington to retool the U.S. economy. A stronger social safety net including better unemployment benefits robust sick leave policies and more job retraining programs could help workers manage shocks and make the economy more resilient. What the country needs is not a series of shortterm bailouts but longterm plans to ensure that most Americans are protected against such crises in the future writes Alden.

FASKIANOS Welcome to CFR s Higher Education Webinar. I m Irina Faskianos vice president of the National Program and Outreach at CFR. Today s discussion is on the record and the video and transcript will be available on our website CFR.orgacademic. CFR takes no institutional positions on matters of policy.We are delighted to have Mordecai Ian Brownlee with us today to talk about the digital equity gap in higher education. Dr. Brownlee is president of the Community College of Aurora in Colorado. He also teaches for Lamar University in the College of Education and Human Development. Dr. Brownlee publishes frequently and serves as a columnist for EdSurge. He has been featured on a number of national platforms including by Diverse Issues in Higher Education magazine as a new school leader representing the next generation of college presidents and he was most recently appointed to serve on the board of directors of the American Association of Community Colleges. So Dr. Brownlee thank you very much for taking the time to be with us. I thought we could begin by having you define digital equity and give us an overview of the digital equity gap in higher education and I know you are going to share a presentation with us so we look forward to seeing that on screen. BROWNLEE Absolutely. Thank you so much for the opportunity to the Council on Foreign Relations. Just thank you all so much. And to answer that question as we talk about digital equity it s the assurance of ensuring that all have access to the information technology available and to have the capacity to engage in society and productive citizenship. And so we ll talk about that and let me just start sharing the screen and we ll jump right into it. All right. Here we go. So once again thank you all for the opportunity again to the Council of Foreign Relations for this opportunity to talk about navigating digital equity. Bringing greetings on behalf of the Community College of Aurora here in Aurora Colorado. And let s just jump right into it. You know as we talk about defining this work how to navigate this work we have to first understand the work and to understand digital equity we must first understand the digital divide. And so you know as we talked about the digital divide at the beginning of the pandemic it certainly was dealing with the voice and mindset the texture and tone of accessibility and being able to engage in learning throughout the pandemic and first of all I would say as educators it s so critical that even as we are quoteunquote coming out of the pandemic that we still acknowledge part of the challenges that are happening across the country and across the world in regards to accessibility equitable accessibility to information technology to the tools and to have the capacity to not only learn but certainly engage in the economy and society. So as we talk about digital equity we must understand the digital divide and so let s kind of define that. One of my favorite definitions for the digital divide defined comes from the National League of Cities and they say the digital divide is the gap between individuals who have access to computers highspeed internet and the skills to use them and those who do not. There s two critical components as we talk about digital equity that I want to call out with the digital divide definition here. One is access. The other is skill. Access and skill. So as we think about equity and just think about how do we level the playing field how do we close the gap on accessibility and skill attainment to engage. And it s not just being able to access and that s the other I think the complexity here as we think about the term equity because just because I provide you the computer right and we found this during the pandemic just because I provide you the computer do you even have broadband access? And if you have broadband access do you have dependable sustainable broadband access? And then if you have sustainable broadband access are you skilled to not only learn but and engage through this instrument and tool and that in itself is where we have found there to be challenges as we think throughout the pandemic and certainly beyond the pandemic on what we must do to close the gap for equity and the digital divide. So digital divide provides that access skill. Equity will then take us deeper into this work.Here are key factors I want to call out in regards to how we must eradicate or address these challenges these factors in order to close the gap on the digital divide. Number one what we have seen through research and digitalresponsibility.org has done a great job of calling this out number one agerelated issues as we think about the various generations that are engaged in society and still present in society.We have digital natives. I consider myself to be a digital native as a millennial. But this is very different than previous generations that may not have had the proper training and skill and their jobs do not have them engaging utilizing these tools and instruments on a regular basis and so that in itself has created some challenges. And again there is certainly all those that are outliers and those among the generations that have been able to engage in these instruments and tools. However it is truly a fact through research that agerelated issues have been a part of this challenge more specifically speaking to our older population.Socioeconomic factors have to talk about it. I think about it especially in the higher education space. Our tribal institutions is where I ve heard throughout the pandemic some of our most severe challenges that have been experienced in regards to the digital divide. One of the stories that I heard that just breaks my heart I remember the first time I heard it it truly had me in tears we were at the height of the pandemic at this point and what we were learning is in one particular tribal community in order for those students to complete these are young K12 students in order for them to complete their assignments they had elders and community members of that tribe that would walk the students up to the highest point on the mountain within that particular tribal territory just to be able to pick up an internet signal and they were able to do this when there was not as much traffic on that internet broadband access that grid if you will. And so those students were having to do their work their homework between the hours of 200 a.m. and 500 a.m. in the morning. Very interesting reality unfortunate reality. We certainly have to come up with the solutions to addressing this. This in itself is part of that digital divide conversation.Geographic causes it depends on where you are in the country. I remember at one point in time I was teaching and served the University of Charleston out of Charleston West Virginia and for those that are familiar with that part of the country in the Appalachia I would have my students that were having to use their own cell phones in order to complete their assignments and upload their assignments. They did not have either in some cases the actual tools or accessibility would have to drive in to more populated spaces to pick up a signal. This was impacting their learning experience. This in itself is all a part of that digital divide. Last certainly not least racial culture language. All of this plays a role and more in that skill set component along with accessibility component and how are we going to as educators as key stakeholders within our community leaders be a part of the solution to close that divide.Agerelated issues socioeconomic factors geographic causes racial cultural and language. Again digitalresponsibility.org is the source on that there. Step two to navigate digital equity we must understand digital equity and so now we re going to go and delve into what does it mean what does digital equity mean. So I m taking my definition again from the National League of Cities. Digital equity is a condition in which all individuals and communities have the information technology capacity needed for full participation in our society democracy and economy. This is huge. So again as you heard me talk about the digital divide just moments ago it s the component of accessibility and skill. That skill is then where we get into productive citizenship through society democracy and economy and so now we re talking about how does this tool this instrument it s much more than just accessibility. Now how do I engage? How am I advancing my family my economic social economic realities through this instrument and tool? The definition goes on to say again by the National League of Cities digital equity is necessary for civic and cultural participation employment lifelong learning and access to essential services. Case in point life. As we think about all aspects of life from employment to social participation as we think social media engagement employment we all understand what that means lifelong learning certainly as educators we have to think about that component and then accessibility to the tools that we need I think about my own child who this past weekend had to reach out for virtual assistance from medical care for an earache that he was having. My ability to have the skill set and accessibility to reach out obtain those resources for my family and engage through an electronic means to fulfill what my needs were are all a part of this equity. Life in itself should be able to remain whole in what I produce and how it is able to produce within me and that is in itself digital equity. So step three let s discuss how to navigate digital equity in higher education and again hello to all of our educators that are on the call today. So here s some tips that I want to leave for you on today just to think about and I look forward to our conversation that we re about to have here in a moment.Number one as educators and we re talking about navigating digital equity it is so important that we understand who we re serving. I say that because unfortunately what can happen is especially as educators and we think about the economy the disruptions that we re experiencing in the marketplace right now we ll sometimes pursue who we want not necessarily who we have and that s unfortunate. As we think about the respective institutional missions and the spaces in which we serve we have to be mission centered and embrace who it is that we re serving because we owe it to those students who are pursuing their academic endeavors and their professional endeavors through our respective institutions to totally be served. We must understand their realities.One of the conversations we have here at the Community College of Aurora is the conversation about you don t know who is actually sitting respectively in that seat in that classroom and what they had to overcome in order to sit in that seat that particular day. Do we know how many bus routes they had to take? Do we understand the challenges that they were having with their children? Do we know are they now leaving their second job that they ve worked for the past twentyfour hours to now sit in your classroom?So we have to understand be aware and approach that engagement with a sense of grace. I think that s a word that we perhaps haven t necessarily embraced in the academy in the way in which we have should have but now more than ever we have to.Secondly create systems that level the learning engagement field. So it s this idea of privilege this thought of privilege and perhaps what we assumed that everyone had access to and what everyone had the ability to engage with that they don t necessarily have and if they do have accessibility to it do we have a true understanding of what all they have to do to have that level of engagement and accessibility? Again case in point bus routes. Think about what s happening around our country. There has been a reduction from a transportation standpoint financially and many of the routes and the transportation services that have been provided some of this due to disruption others due to areas in which there have had to be a funneling of tax dollars and resources in other spaces and places in our communities. Long story short the reality is is that in many communities the bus routes have had to be reduced which means that individuals are either having to walk or find ways to public accessibility to some of these resources in terms of broadband access and computer access. So then as we re teaching and we re instructing and we re providing services we have to think about how can we level the playing field and remove barriers? Does it have to be performed does that learning outcome have to come in the form of computer access and broadband accessibility? And maybe it does so this takes us to point number three. Let s promote community resources to close the digital divide. I think that laser focus on how we re going to close that divide creates this space for equity and so perhaps it s through libraries. There s one organization out of North Carolina in some of their rural spaces they have now through grant funds created different spaces in their rural communities for those in more rural spaces to gain access to a computer lab and the grants are sustaining that accessibility through computer labs in those rural spaces. Amazing resource.There s many others and examples that we can share around the country. So with that said let s promote these community resources. Sometimes it s a library. Sometimes it s a grantfunded opportunity. Sometimes it s a local nonprofit. So let s talk about how we can be creative in our respective communities to close the gap there. Fourth adjust learning experiences to be more inclusive. Not only do we need to create the systems to level the playing field but we must then adjust the learning experiences to be more inclusive to create learning spaces and engagement spaces for all going back to not only accessibility but skill. Last certainly not least providing institutional resources to close the digital divide. What I mean by this is is that in closing due to through the pandemic and many of our institutions received the Higher Education Emergency Relief Funds the HEERF funds. Those HEERF funds were utilized in many different ways. In many cases we were able to do laptop loan programs. In some spaces they were even doing hotspot loan programs. And so now that we are coming out of the pandemic what does it look like to sustain these resources OK because now that we provide these resources how do we sustain them? How do we ensure that we re having longterm engagements? One of the things that I want and I ask from my educators especially administrators to look at How do we close this inaudible without placing the costs on the backs of our students? They already have enough going on. We don t need to just move the cost of something on to their tuition and fees. How can we be even more creative with the engagements and enrollments of our students to being laser focused on what we re doing to close again many of those factors and gaps that were highlighted earlier? So grateful for the opportunity. Have a website. Would love to engage with you all more. I know we re getting ready to go into conversation. But itsdrmordecai.com and again thank you all so much for the opportunity. FASKIANOS Fantastic. Thank you so much for that overview. So we re going to go to all of you for your questions now. You can click the raised hand icon on your screen to ask a question and on an iPad or a tablet click the more button to access the raised hand feature. When you re called upon accept the unmute prompt and please state your name and affiliation followed by a question. You can also submit a written question by the Q A icon and I will read out the question and if you do write your question please include your affiliation just to give us a sense of where you re coming from. And there are no questions as of yet but I know that will change or else you were so thorough that nobody has questions. Laughs.So do you see now with the pandemic experience that there will be continued I m going to ask the first question you know that this has opened up the space now for deeper understanding of the digital divide and bringing the resources to bear? Or now that we re kind of postpandemic or whatever this is people have forgotten about it and are moving on?BROWNLEE Thank you so much for the question my friend.I think that it s twofold. There s two sides of this coin right. So there s the one side of the coin where the awareness now is so much deeper and richer than it ever has been because of the amount of resources and what it took to sustain since 2020 those resources that were being provided to the students in the community. So now there s many that have learned and they re now having those conversations about how to sustain the resources because as we all know while there s been an extension of HEERF funds through the Department of Education that day is coming to an end here pretty soon and so we have to talk about sustainability. The other side of that coin is unfortunately there are those that acknowledge what the realities were but their agenda is more on how do we move past it not necessarily sustain what we were providing. That s part of the issue for some that we have to address because we don t just move on from hardship right. That hardship is real and we have to still maintain a laser focus on how we re going to close the digital divide especially in the academic spaces but also understanding our responsibility as not only educators but community leaders stakeholders within our community to be a part of the solutions and the expansions on equitable access and resources being made available. And so I think with both sides of those coins we re seeing two different realities. But I think that there s also a need now more than ever to maintain the senses of urgency around the haves and have nots and what we re going to do to be a part of the solution to ensure that we re raising the level of accessibility and skill for all within our communities. FASKIANOS I noted in your presentation you talked about knowing who your students are. So what advice do you have for higher education educators and leaders who are trying to navigate the digital divide in their classroom and to get to know to figure out where their students are coming from and what their needs may be?BROWNLEE So as we all know especially in the IR space right there s different tools resources that we can use to survey our students. There s different splash pages if you will that we can utilize in terms of the enrollment processes or the readvising processes or even think of some of our learning management tools that we can engage with students to determine what their needs truly are. I think that it s important that we create tools and instruments that will have high engagement rates. Sometimes those have to be incentivized. But we have to think about outside of our normal student leader responses how we re capturing the voice of all of our students. And so that s those that would not typically provide response and as we think about the digital divide we have to acknowledge that that tool that instrument can t just be electronic. What are we going to do to have paper resources or maybe through phone conversations outreach being able to have certainly the walk around conversations around our respective campuses and the universities. And so we need to have those conversations to make sure that we re capturing the voice of all of our students I think is in the true spirit of continued improvement. We have to understand who we serve and then acknowledge through the development of systems and the recalibration of our student experiences are the voice of these students. FASKIANOS Right. And in terms of the skills because community colleges are so focused on developing the skills what specifically are you doing at Aurora or are you seeing in the community college space to help students develop those skills that they need to navigate digitally?BROWNLEE Absolutely. One of the things I ll talk about and those that may not be aware and I don t know who all has visited Denver but the history of Aurora Aurora is the most diverse community city in the state of Colorado. I call that out because immigrants it has a strong there s a strong population in this community and so part of our young thirtynine years of existence in this community has been providing English second language courses. We re noticing that especially our immigrant families and communities that are seeking social and economic mobility highly skilled from where they come from but now we must create learning opportunities to close that gap not only through language but through accessibility in this American market. And so through our community ESL programs we ve been able to educate upwards of two thousand students a year and walk them through the various levels of learning and engagement with the English language and then at some point in that process learning process we then engage and begin the computer engagement in utilizing the English language in their native language and beginning to close that gap. So I think that that work in itself is a part of that digital equity that must be created how do you create the foundation to build upon to then advance the engagement. And there s been some other great examples that I ve seen around the country in doing that work a lot of grant programs that I ve seen in respective communities. You heard me talk about what s happening out there in the Carolinas. But I think about what s also happening over in California. California has been a great state that s been able to do some work about working and identifying through heat maps and institutional resource research and resources and community resources looking at demographics identifying low socioeconomic spaces and putting concentrated efforts in those particular communities to increase the level of engagement accessibility and skill and it s critical and key. FASKIANOS Great. We have a question from Gloria Ayee. So if you can unmute yourself and state your affiliation. Q Hello. Thank you so much for sharing this important work that you re doing. I am Gloria Ayee and I am a lecturer and senior research fellow at Harvard University and my question is about the connection between the digital divide and also how it mirrors to current inequities that we see in the educational system in general. So thinking about that type of relationship what do you think are the most significant challenges to addressing the digital divide given the issues that we continue to see with the educational system in general at all types of institutions and what do you foresee as the best way to actually address these challenges?BROWNLEE Oh that s a great question. Great question. Thank you so much for asking that question Gloria.I would say two things come to mind funding and agenda right. So if I ll tell you what comes to mind for me. So as we think about financially and we look at how these institutions are funded around the country let s think K12. So grade schools. Think K12. Let s also think higher education. Are we talking headcount? Are we talking fulltime equivalency? Are we talking success points? Are we talking even as we think about developmental education how are these institutions being funded to sustain the work of working especially with low socioeconomic communities? Let s just take for example fulltime equivalency especially in this higher education space. So if I were someone who wanted to work to create programs that I m going to help in the advancing and addressing of the digital divide and advancing digital equity I need funds in order to do that. Now could I pursue grant funds? Absolutely. But even we all know that grant funds are not necessarily all the time sustainable funds. Shortterm funds but it still has to be a hardlined. So then as we think about doing this work I ll go back to funding and agenda realizing and looking at what would need to shift within particularly my state s legislative agenda or perhaps in that particular district how the funding is occurring. If I m working with a high population which we are here at the Community College of Aurora a high population of parttime students these are students that are maybe taking one class and engaging. However if I m funded by a fulltime equivalency model it then takes several students that are taking one class to then equal that one fulltime equivalent which then impacts my funding structure. So then how do I then serve yet I am seeking to obtain? And this is where we then get into I think a part of that friction of agenda and funding models. So I think that as we think equity with an equity mindset beyond just the initiatives of overlay we actually want to bake in the equity experience within our respective states and communities then we re going to have to take a look at the funding agenda the agenda and funding how are we truly going to advance equity and closing the digital divide. It has to be funded properly towards sustainability. We ve seen this same thing occur in developmental education as well for those who ve been a part of those conversations where we saw around the country there will be a reduction in developmental education funding which has been impacted in some cases the success rates and resources that were historically provided through community colleges in certain communities. Same thing in this digital divide space and digital equity. So funding an agenda and I think that the solution is is really coming to the table and saying what does equity look like without it being an overlaid agenda without it just being a conversation? What does it look like for it to be baked into the experience of how we re going to transform lives which then means that in many cases legislatively and funding models. We have to move from a transactional mindset to a transformational mindset and we have to go all in on ensuring that we re creating equitable communities and engagements for those that we serve. Oh you re muted my friend. FASKIANOS Yes. Thank you. After twoandahalf years laughter I should know that. Encourage all of you to share your best practices and what you re doing in your communities as well. You know we have seen the Biden administration really focusing on diversity equity and inclusion. They re focusing on bringing more diversity to the State Department and other parts of the government. Is the Department of Education looking at the funding model? Is this an area that they are actively trying to reform and adjust? BROWNLEE I get the sense and I ve had the pleasure of speaking in front of several legislators in different venues I get the sense that there is a major conversation that s happening. I do. I truly get the sense that there s a major conversation happening not just with our current administration from thinking about our U.S. president but also thinking local legislators as well.I really think that there s conversations many conversations that are happening. If anything I feel as though the major I don t want to use the word barrier so I m searching for the appropriate word here. But I think the major hurdle that we re going to have to think about is how we have built and designed our funding models to date. You know some of these funding models were built in early 1990s mid1990s in some cases. Really you don t see it too much early 2000s and so we have older financial modeling infrastructure that we re trying to pursue this work and how to change it. And so it can t be a BandAid approach. I think in some spaces and communities that s what s been done is that rather than changing the actual model the infrastructure itself it s received a BandAid in the form of grants. And I do believe that grants are significant and certainly necessary and appreciated. However I think that we re reaching a point in society where there has to be a total restructuring of our funding models and taking a look at what percentages are going where taking a look at the demographics in our respective communities taking a look at the economic realities in our respective communities. Take a look at just how much the demographics are shifting in our respective communities and building a model that s ready to engage sustain and raise the level for all and I think that we re on our way. I certainly hope that we are. FASKIANOS Thank you. I m going to take the next question from Rufus Glasper. Q I am here.FASKIANOS Wonderful.Q Hi Mordecai. How are you today? BROWNLEE How are you sir?Q Hi Irina.FASKIANOS Hi Rufus. Great to hear from you. Q Mordecai talk a little bit about digital equity and faculty. How have they accepted rejected embraced what you were describing as all of the different factors that are affecting our students and what kind of practices have you developed or can be developed to ensure that faculty can continue the progress and include our students who are most needy? BROWNLEE Great question Dr. Glasper. I didn t expect anything different coming from you. So let me just say we ve had some very intense conversations and I have to really give our faculty and our instructors kudos because I will tell you this is probably by far one of the most engaged communities that I ve ever worked in of educators that are committed to just truly getting to the solution. There s some strong work that was done around inclusive excellence here at the Community College of Aurora certainly prior to my arrival. It led to this college receiving an Inclusive Excellence Award from the American Association of Community Colleges right around 2017.Part of their work at that time was looking at as our faculty and our academy how were we going to close the gap on success rates particularly in English and math and part of that work was creating resources towards gap closure to ensure that those that had not traditionally and historically had access to some of those learning materials and plans and resources that they were being provided those in a more intensive way. Now as we think more into the digital space and certainly think through the pandemic what we ve now done as an institution is that we ve become Community College of Aurora has become the very first Achieving the Dream institution in the state of Colorado and one of the projects that our faculty and our instructors are delving into I ve got a big meeting tomorrow on this matter of fact is taking a look at the respective success rates in our gateway courses our key courses that are gateways into our respective academic programs and asking ourselves how can we create more equitable learning experiences.Two things critical things that I ve seen our faculty do.Number one looking at the data. I think that the data is key and critical taking a look disaggregating that data. And our faculty and our instructors continue to do that work looking at a threeyear spread a fiveyear spread and saying Where is the success occurring? Who s it occurring with and those respective identities of those students? And then really asking the hard questions Why isn t this population succeeding at the same rate as this population?The other part of this criticality is is also then accepting that there can t be an excuse in the work. There can t be an excuse in the work and that we must ensure then that we are creating the equitable resources and infrastructure to close the gap create learning experiences and say listen if our students can t access the internet and the Web then what can we do to create for them the resources whether it be paper? If they can t come to the teaching demonstration at this particular day how can I create an opportunity for them to engage and obtain that information at another given time? Perhaps they re a working parent and can t necessarily attend at 1000 a.m. but they can at 500 p.m. What are we doing to level the playing field with accessibility? And the other aspect of that is just that our faculty and instructors have been partnering to create these more holistic learning engagement opportunities where if we re having a conversation in English then what can we do within our math department and almost cohorting in a sense the learning experiences amongst those two separate classes but then creating like engagements where the same conversations happening in English could be happening in math and science to begin to bring about a new learning within the students to say OK well this particular world issue now I m understanding it through various lenses and I understand the interconnectivity in these learning experiences.And so more integrated learning and I think that we ve got a long way to go but we re committed to doing that work. FASKIANOS So Rufus Glasper is the chancellor of Maricopa Community Colleges and I just thought I would ask you Rufus to maybe share your experience as the chancellor what has been working in your community. Q I am the chancellor emeritus. I have not been at the colleges for a little over six years now. But I am the president and CEO for the League for Innovation in the Community College.And one of the things that I d like to connect with with our experience right now we are involved in the state of Arizona with a project which is which we are embracing. We are working with four different types of institutions right now urban metropolitan we have a couple of rural institutions and we have a couple of tribal and we re trying to make that connectiveness between insecurities student insecurities. So we re looking at housing. We re looking at hunger. We re looking at jobs. And one of the things that we have found is that we can t make either of these items connect and work without broadband first and the reason being when you re looking at access it s critical when you start to look at the activities that are occurring throughout the U.S. now and specifically within Arizona I ll talk about the connections we have now made that are national in scope that are city town and county in scope and the commitments that we are now working to obtain from all of those who are in position relative to enhancing broadband access and digital equity. There s actually a Center for Digital Equity at Arizona State University ASU and last week we had a gathering of all of our institutions to get a better understanding of what does digital equity mean as it comes from the ASU center. What does it mean for each of our different types of institutions and I will tell you that the one that was hardest hit was the one you talked about and that s tribal just in terms of access in terms of resources. But I am pleased with the dollars that are out there now at all levels. So if this is a time for us to increase access increase affordability than I think we should seize the moment. My question then which would lead to another one is on the whole notion of sustainability and you talked about that in terms of stimulus kinds of resources and equity is in everyone s face right now especially broadband and others. Is it a sustainable initiative and focus and what are the elements that need to be connected in order to make sure that it stays in the forefront and that our students who may have benefited from buses sitting in their neighborhood during the pandemic and others but are still trying to make choices? And I ll make the last connection point and you made the opening how flexible should our institutions be around workbased learning so that our students who are not able to come to the campus and be there on a regular basis but want to balance having a virtual environment? Do you see a balance coming or do you see us forced into staying the old antiquated model of facetoface classes and sixteen and eighteen weeks? BROWNLEE Let me start with the sustainability component then. Thank you again Dr. Glasper. From a sustainability standpoint I ll say here at the institution part of the conversation it s a hard conversation. But I encourage every educator to have this conversation this brave conversation in your spaces. Let s take a look at your success rates and I m just particularly speaking to higher education right now. Let s take a look at your various academic profiles. Let s take a look at what has been your engagements with your workforce partners your advisory councils in many cases and let s talk about two things one the sustainability of those programs and two the social and economic mobility of those programs directly to workforce.I think what we will find is what we found here at the Community College of Aurora is that over time the various disruptions that have occurred has shifted the needs of our students. However the institutions respectively delivering these services have not shifted with the times. And so it is quite possible that either our approach to the work or the actual lack of proper programming is prohibiting social and economic mobility in many of these communities and especially for us. Fiftytwo percent of our students are first generation. Sixtyseven percent of our students are students of color. So as we talk about sustainability we re right there on the front line of having to take a look at enrollment fulltime equivalency completion graduation and employment rates and we began to find a shifting of that. And so when we talk sustainability I bring this up as a framework if you will to say once you ve had those conversations now let s talk about where there are losses financial losses and areas in which we can truly be innovative and reallocate dollars that were once going in certain areas and infuse that into other areas that are going to have a higher return. So I think thinking truly with a return on investment an ROI mindset will then help us to not only meet the needs of our mission meet it in its current state and its current needs and the disruption that s currently being experienced which will then help create new opportunities for sustainability beyond what has just been HEERF funding or potential grant funding it can be hardlined into the institutional mission. I think the other component of that sustainability too is looking at the strategic plans of our respective organizations looking at those not only the mission but the objectives and asking how equity is not necessarily a separate objective but equity is actually ingrained in all aspects of the objectives the strategic objectives because at that point we can then understand the significance in resourcing and funding equity all the way through the entirety of the institution. In regards to your latter question about workbased learning and the old model of doing things I certainly believe and hope Dr. Glasper that there s this new movement that s occurring where we re going to have to embrace whether we like it or not the next era of higher education and that next era will require us to not approach things in the same modalities and same ways.We re watching especially in research the confidence levels reduce heavily reduced now in the public s perception of what higher education is to provide in comparison to what it once provided. Higher education in many communities isn t necessarily being seen as the sole or the primary tool towards social economic mobility as it once was twenty thirty years ago. So what does this mean? Our approach to sixteenweek instruction is certainly going to have to be transformed. What does it look like to have fiveweek instruction? Eightweek instruction? What does it look like for us to have true noncredit instructional programs that s in direct partnership with business and industry to ramp up the training and social economic mobility opportunities within our communities? Folks aren t necessarily looking for a twoyear or a fouryear or a sixyear learning experience. They need to put food on their family s table today. What does it look like for them to engage with the institution and have that kind of learning experience and we have to do it with a digital equity mindset right because they re seeking opportunity. So it doesn t necessarily mean that they have accessibility in their current state. We want to get them to a state where they can have that accessibility. So how then do we create those tools? One key component of this is even looking at our college application processes. What is the readability score on some of these applications? We want to educate those that may have a reading level of a seventh or eighth grade reading level. But some of these college applications are reading at a fourteen fifteen grade reading level. That in itself is creating a barrier to those that are seeking opportunity that need the opportunity to up skill. And so I think that the old model is going to in my opinion and hopefully quickly deteriorate and we re going to have to be more effective. But let me also say this. It is critical that we have our faculty and our instructors at the table. These decisions shouldn t be thrown upon them. It should be conversations that we re having collectively together and then how can then we resource our faculty and our instructors and our staff to be a part of those solutions drive those solutions reinvest in them to be able to create more innovative and more I ll say the word relevant learning experiences because I truly believe that relevance is not necessarily a word that we ve used in higher education in terms of our approach but now more than ever we re going to have to. FASKIANOS OK. So I m going to take a written question from Nicole Muthoni who is an entrepreneur and innovator at the University of Connecticut. She has been passionately working on bridging the divide in emergent nations especially Kenya. Therefore in this regard the key factors creating the digital divide in this space is geographic causes socioeconomic factors and culture.So the question is what tools and programs can we use to effectively educate teachers to learn the necessary skills that they can use to teach their students in the classrooms. This is because most of the teachers have not been empowered with the necessary and needed skills for educating in the space of digital equity.BROWNLEE I think I began to speak to that right towards the end of what I was just sharing right. FASKIANOS Right.BROWNLEE It s this idea of we ve got to get out of the blame game. Oh I want you to come up with the solution. Well how are you investing in me to be a part of the solution? How are you even engaging me in part of being the solution? You know as I talked earlier about those conversations we re having at CCA about what are those programs that have been unsustainable or times have shifted and changed and we needed to create some more relevant learning experiences. It is our faculty and our instructors that made that decision to be able to say hey it s time to pivot.They were at the table. Not just present for the sake of inclusion but truly the decision makers in that work. Now I think the next component of this work as we talked about achieving the dream and us being the first in the state of Colorado part of our strategic plan is creating a we don t have a name so just work with me here conceptually.We don t have a name yet. But I can tell you what the desired outcome is and the desired outcome is that we create a learning center for our faculty and our instructors to grow and to be invested in and to learn what are those emerging approaches that will on the verge of becoming best practices. However they re not quoteunquote best practices around the country yet.What could we create here at CCA to be a part of those solutions? And also exposure to national best practice. What are we doing to invest into our people? So I think that part of that shifting that Dr. Glasper was calling out is going to have to occur now more than ever because unfortunately what s happened I think in the academy too many of our instructors and faculty have been blamed. Too many of our staff had been blamed not engaged and brought about to be the solution and not just thrown right out there in the fire to say come up with something.No. You need to care for your folks more deeply more passionately and more genuinely than we have ever before and really ask the question how are we going to be relevant and make sure that our folks feel cared for and that they re valued in the spaces in which they re serving.FASKIANOS Thank you. So the next question is from Krishna GarzaBaker from the University of Texas at San Antonio. What would you say is the role of private service providers and their ability to assist in reducing the digital divide? Are they doing enough to collaborate with higher education institutions to address this area specifically internet service providers? And I m going to add on to that. What are your recommendations for how schools can and should be leveraging corporate and community partnerships to help address the digital divide?BROWNLEE You know you heard me earlier talk about how we can t just do this overlay approach. Yes I want to give you a voucher for reduced broadband access. That s wonderful. It is. It is grateful. It s better than not having it.But now let s talk about how we re truly going to hardline in opportunities for all. As we think about the spirit of advocacy unfortunately sometimes as they say it s the squeaky wheel gets the grease I think is how it s communicated. And so what I would say is is that now we have to think about those that don t have a voice how we re still meeting their needs. And so working directly with corporate industry partners those who have the access. What does it look like if we focus less on trying to make a dollar and more on trying to create opportunity? What would it look like if we all came about and said we want to be the solution to the issue? Yes there s areas and opportunities where we ll make that dollar. But as we think about society as a whole what does it look like to create experiences and a life for the goodness of all? And so I think that now we really more than ever have to have these conversations. More than ever it just can t be who gets the voucher. It s how do you create the accessibility for all those who have a voice and those who know how to use their voice. And I think that if I understand the nature of that question now I will say with private entities corporate partnerships I think it s more visibility in these colleges and universities and these nonprofit spaces beyond the cameras and just looking at the campaigns. What does it look like for us to have the conversations day in and day out to say we re neighbors we re all going to collectively be a part of the solutions and to bring the rising up if you will of our communities to raise the level for all and that s certainly what we re seeking to do. We ve seen some major responsiveness in this particular community to say listen outside of just some campaign and a picture what does it look like for you all to be a part of our learning experience a part of our community a part of our solutions and to hardline these experiences for all.So equity causes and it charges and it demands that and we have to realize the power of that.FASKIANOS Thank you. I m going to take the next question from Laila Bichara from SUNY Farmingdale.Many of my students are immigrants and are firstgeneration college students. My question is about skill transfer once our students get access to technology for themselves and their families who are then losing their jobs due to automation. BROWNLEE Demographic shift. I talked about it earlier.You know I think about here in the Denver Metro area and I m going to I attended a site visit conversation with their chamber of commerce there in Denver. It was pretty telling. In looking at the demographics it broke down how for millennials I think there s currently so there s 3.3 million in the greater Denver area. It broke down for millennials which I fall into this group I think it was eight hundred and sixtyfour thousand millennials currently in that space.Then it had Xers. Not Xers. It had generation Z. Z accounted for roughly six hundred thousand. But get this. So my children my eight and my fouryearold they re generation alpha were only accounting for roughly three hundred thousand in the space currently right now. I say that as an example that I m going to walk us through really quickly and that is is with the lens of equity and we think about the shifting and the disruptions in market and we think about especially now in the markets humanization versus automation and we want to create social and economic mobility for these respective spaces wherever those realities are and we think about accessibility to the internet and we talk about that digital equity and the digital divide we then have to have a high degree of urgency within us to say that what will can we create today that will prevent communities of color and low socioeconomic communities that traditionally in this current market would have been given opportunities but that in the future market due to a lack of potential skill and accessibility will not be provided the resources and the opportunities that they once were in an automated world. And so what do we do then to make sure that they re not the one pressing the button. They re the one that s coding the button right and that s all a part of that work and that shifting. So it s going to take stronger math and science skills and accessibility and equity all built into their learning experiences because if not the wide we will widen the gap the poverty gap because we move again deeper into automation lessen the humanization and then we are essentially moving an entire population of folks further down the supply chain if you will which then will prohibit their learning not learning their earning ability. And so we have to be laser focused on those realities and really look to eradicate what s going to be future barriers now so systematically we are able to address it. FASKIANOS Great. So the last question I wanted to ask you is you ve just completed your first year as president. What are the lessons that you ve learned? BROWNLEE Oh my gosh. I will tell you that you know I just released an article on this talking about my first year in the presidency and through EdSurge and lessons learned and one of those lessons I would say is is that I highlighted in that article is you know don t do more for an institution than you would do for your own family. I think that as educators as community leaders and anyone that s on this call I ll just take the opportunity to encourage you. You know sometimes we give our all to these entities in which we serve and we do it and we give it countless hours. You know we say it s a fortyhour job but we re probably spending fifty sixty seventy if not more and we get lost in that right.And so there s good work to be done. However what is the biggest mockery of all to save the world but lose your own family? And I think that part of my lesson that I had to really reflect on was like right now as I m giving this lecture my eightyearold son is here in the office with me right now that I m trying to get to be quiet and work with me as I m giving having this time with you all now right. He doesn t have school today. It s an inservice day. But really creating those engagements for my family to be engaged in the experiences and making sure that they re part of the process. I think the other component of this is too and I talked about this in the article is realizing that it is a privilege to serve never taking for granted the ability the opportunity that we have to serve because there s others that wish that they had these opportunities. So yes even in our most our days of most frustration it still is a pleasure and a blessing and an opportunity to serve and honor. And so what would life look like if we embraced it for the pleasure and the honor that it truly is and how we treat and create spaces for others to thrive because they re sacrificing being away from their families and loved ones to do this work. We need to create more communities for all to thrive. FASKIANOS Oh your son should be very proud of you. I have to say that what a role model. BROWNLEE Thank you.FASKIANOS I m going to go next to Laurette Foster.Laurette please say your affiliation. It s great to have you on.Q Hi. Laurette Foster Prairie View A M University in Texas. And I really don t have a question. I just want to say how delighted I was to hear the conversation and hear about what the next steps are because looking back at the pandemic and how we wanted to step up and do so much and I m just afraid that even though we did those things that needed to be done that many of us now are settling back into the old ways.And it s still funny that when you told the story about the tribal community happened to go to the top of the mountain from 200 in the morning to do the passion for education is there with the kids. But we have to continue to do our part. So I just appreciate all the comments and that you did today. It was really enlightening. So thank you very much. BROWNLEE And thank you and I will say that my wife is a proud product of Prairie View A M. The Hill as well. So just thank you for your comments. FASKIANOS We have another thank you from John Marks of LSU of Alexandria just saying that it was really great to take time out of his day and to said they definitely in Louisiana access and skills are indeed real obstacles that are typical of every online class that he s taught. I m going to take the final question from Haetham AbdulRazaq from Northwest Vista College again from San Antonio Texas working on a research project regarding online learning and community college students. One of the interesting findings is that some students might be considered as tech savvy yet they have problems engaging in online classes. Do you think that we should build on the strengths of our students digital knowledge when it comes to these sorts of skills?BROWNLEE Great question. Absolutely. I think you know we talk about creating studentcentered approaches and sometimes we re successful at that and other times we re not perhaps because if we were to really delve into studentcentered approaches just how far from our base currently of how we approach higher education just how far it ll take us. But I would say going back to an earlier conversation now s the time more than ever to go there. Matter of fact we should have went there already before. It s time truly for a revolution and an evolution in our approach to learning and engagement and advancement with an equity lens. And I go back to that word relevance. We have to create more relevant learning experiences. Think about business and industry. If we look at what s happened over the past ten years due to some of our bureaucracies and our lack of responsiveness.Look at business and industry. They re creating learning experiences right around higher education in some cases not even engaging higher education anymore directly working with middle schools and high schools to create their own strong pipelines. What has happened that that even came about right? And so due to a lack of responsiveness perhaps innovation true innovation and that studentcentered approach that we perhaps moved far from or maybe just took parts of that was easier to tackle not the harder aspects of that and so we now have to tackle it. We have to embrace it because if not I think that five ten years from now certainly twenty years from now we ll have more institutional closures more reductions in enrollments if we fail to be responsive and create these more equitable learning opportunities that are geared at creating a digital equity. FASKIANOS Right. Well we are just at the end of our time.Thank you very much Dr. Mordecai Brownlee. We really appreciate your being with us and sharing your insights and to all of you for your questions and comments. And so you can follow Dr. Mordecai and also go to his website itsdrmordecai.com and at itsdrmordecai correct?BROWNLEE That is correct. That is correct. I look forward to engaging with everyone. FASKIANOS Wonderful. We really appreciate it. Just as a reminder for all of you our next Higher Education webinar will be on Wednesday November 2 at 100 p.m. Eastern time.

Related concepts are lifetime Inequality inequality in incomes for an individual over his or her lifetime Inequality of Wealth distribution of wealth across households or individuals at a moment in time and Inequality of Opportunity impact on income of circumstances over which individuals have no control such as family socioeconomic status gender or ethnic background. All of these inequality concepts are related and offer different yet complementary insights into the causes and consequences of inequality hence providing better guidance to governments when designing specific policies aimed at addressing inequality. Gini coefficient is a typical measure of income inequality. The coefficient varies between 0 and 1 with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 perfect inequality. Most of the analysis is centered on the concept of income inequality as captured by the Gini coefficient which is available for a large number of countries and relatively long periods. Unless specified otherwise Gini income inequality refers to disposable income or consumption and thus already reflects any redistribution through taxes and transfers.  A range of global and domestic factors which may reinforce each other have been proposed in the theory and empirical literature to account for the income inequality trends. The key forces include the following  Sources Historical series are from Van Zaden and others 2014 who build on Bourguignon and Morrisson 2002. Recent data is from Lakner and Milanovich 2013.  Source IMF Fiscal Monitor October 2017  Inequality is at the center stage of economic policy debate across the globe. A fair and equitable distribution of income is a fundamental element of the social contract. Macroeconomic policies including government tax and spending policies have significant effects on income distribution and that inequality can have adverse political and social consequences with the potential to undermine macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. Inequality is thus without any surprise an important issue for the IMF in all three of its core activities  2 macroeconomic surveillance including related policy analysis and  3 technical assistance to build capacity especially on government taxation and spending. Historically distributive issues have been an important part of the IMF s dialogue with member countries. Work on them has especially intensified in the wake of the global financial crisis that began in 2008. IMF work on income inequality before the global financial crisis that began in 2008 was particularly influenced by the experience gained from IMFsupported programs. In practice this experience led to greater attention to integrating social safety nets into adjustment programs and safeguarding access to basic public services in health and education. Other initiatives such as the introduction of the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility in 1999 brought growth and poverty reduction objectives to the center of program design in lowincome countries as did the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries debtrelief initiative. IMFsupported programs were successful in raising social spending including in comparison with similar countries without programs. The IMF has further deepened its work on inequality issues in the years since the beginning of the global financial crisis. This effort has encompassed an expansion of both crosscountry analytical studies and countrylevel assessments of fiscal consolidation and inequality a variety of fiscal policy instruments to achieve equity goals in an efficient manner and the macroeconomic gains from strengthening gender equity. An important lesson is that with the right design government tax and spending policies can help achieve both stronger growth and greater equality of outcomes and opportunities. For example boosting access to basic health and education services and reducing barriers to female labor market participation can help raise growth and meet equity objectives. Even in the design of fiscal consolidation a number of options can help reduce budget deficits without aggravating inequality. These include measures to raise revenues from income taxes and targeted rather than acrosstheboard reductions in social benefits. Measures that are good for both equity and efficiency for example an increase in revenues from recurrent property taxation should also be given strong consideration when designing fiscal consolidation packages. The IMF will continue to strengthen its analytical work on income distribution issues. These efforts will involve further crosscountry analysis on different aspects of macroeconomic policies and how they affect income distribution. Work at the country level on income distribution issues will also be deepened. The approach will be selective and it will be concentrated on countries where these issues are critical. The IMF expects considerable synergies between countrylevel and crosscountry analysis and the IMF will continue to draw on the profession s work in these areas. In sum the IMF will continue to deepen understanding of the nexus between income distribution and macroeconomics with the goal of providing relevant policy advice. With the expected increase in income inequality as a result of the COVID19 pandemic the IMF s work on inequality issues is expected to become even more intense.  2022 International Monetary Fund.

https://www.epi.org/publication/secular-stagnation/, Report Raising Americas Pay Report By Josh Bivens December 12 2017  Download PDF Press release What this report finds Income inequality in the United States is suppressing growth in aggregate demand spending by households businesses and governments by shifting an ever larger share of income to rich households that save rather than spend. This rise in inequality has been overwhelmingly driven by the failure of pay for typical American workers to keep pace with economywide productivity growth. EPI estimates that rising inequality has slowed growth in aggregate demand by 2 to 4 percentage points of GDP annually in recent years. Why it matters For decades the drag on demand growth stemming from rising inequality has been compensated for by other economic and policy developments notably a longrunning decline in interest rates. Going forward however these compensating mechanisms are likely to fail which means that the inequalityinduced drag on demand would translate directly into slower economic growth overall. What we can do about it In the near term we need more expansionary macroeconomic policies lower interest rates and larger budget deficits to counter the downward pressure on demand. In the longer run we need to stop or reverse rising inequality by enacting policies that spur faster wage growth for low and middlewage workers. Raising these workers wages would not only raise living standards for American families it would also ensure robust economic growth. Executive summaryIncome inequality in the United States has risen dramatically since the late 1970s and the issue has drawn heightened attention in recent years. In the past decade economic observers have also become increasingly worried about secular stagnation or a chronic shortfall of aggregate demand fearing that this shortfall will constrain American economic growth in coming years. These two phenomena rising inequality and chronic weakness of demand are related. Specifically rising inequality transfers income from lowsaving households in the bottom and middle of the income distribution to highersaving households at the top. All else equal this redistribution away from low to highsaving households reduces consumption spending which drags on demand growth. This paper argues that a key lever for solving the problem of secular stagnation is halting or even reversing the root cause of rising inequality the growing wedge between productivity and pay for typical American workers. Following are our key findings The rise in inequality has contributed significantly to the downward pressure on demand growth that is labeled secular stagnation. Inequality has transferred income from low and middleincome households with relatively low savings rates towards higherincome households with higher savings rates. All else equal this transfer drags on demand growth as consumption grows more slowly. This transfer will likely slow growth in aggregate demand by an estimated 2 to 4 percentage points of gross domestic product GDP every year going forward from today. 1 The problem of anemic wage growth recognized for decades by American workers wishing for higher paychecks has finally reached the frontburner of American politics. Angst over the stagnant pay of lowwage workers has for example sparked recent movements to raise minimum federal state and local minimum wages far above levels that have characterized the recent past and often even to levels that would constitute historical highs.2 This new attention to the crisis of American pay is totally proper. The failure of wages of the vast majority of Americans to benefit from economywide growth in productivity or income generated in an average hour of work has been the root cause of the stratospheric rise in inequality and the concentration of economic growth at the very top of the income distribution. Had this upward redistribution not happened incomes for the bottom 90 percent of Americans would be roughly 20 percent higher today.3 In short the rise in inequality driven by anemic wage growth has imposed an inequality tax on American households that has robbed them of a fifth of their potential income. There would be huge benefits to American wellbeing from blocking or reversing this upward redistribution. This welfare gain stemming from blocking upward redistribution is the primary reason to champion policy measures to boost wage growth and lead to a more equal distribution of income gains. Put simply a dollar is worth more to a family living paycheck to paycheck than it is to families comfortably in the top 1 percent of the income distribution. Proponents of increases in the minimum wage and other measures to boost American wages have often argued that there are benefits to these policies besides the welfare gains stemming from pure redistribution. These proponents have often argued that boosting wages would even benefit aggregate economic outcomes like growth in gross domestic product GDP or employment. Recent evidence about developments in the American and global economies strongly indicate that these arguments are correct boosting wages of the bottom 90 percent would not just raise these households incomes and welfare a morethansufficient reason to do so it would also boost overall growth. For the past decade and maybe even longer the primary constraint on American economic growth has been tooslow spending by households businesses and governments. In economists jargon the constraint has been growth in aggregate demand lagging behind growth in the economy s productive capacity including growth of the labor force and the stock of productive capital such as plants and equipment. Much research indicates that this shortfall of demand could become a chronic problem in the future constantly pulling down growth unless macroeconomic policy changes dramatically. It is now wellknown that incomes in America grew much less equally after 1979. Probably the most important fact about this growing inequality is that it has overwhelmingly been driven by trends in marketbased income rather than in the taxes and transfers component of income. Table 1 shows the sources of income growth for the top 1 percent of households in the three decades before the Great Recession. It uses Congressional Budget Office CBO 2016 data on comprehensive household income which includes noncash marketbased income such as employer contributions to health insurance premiums as well as non marketbased income such as government transfers. The CBO data show that inequality is increasing the share of all income that is going to the top is rising because the top 1 percent are getting a greater share of each type of market income and because the types of market income that are most concentrated at the top particularly capital gains and business income constitute a growing share of all income whereas income from lessconcentrated sources particularly labor compensation is falling as a share of overall income. The data in the table also indicate that the direct arithmetic influence of taxes and transfers has been minimal with rising inequality of market incomes explaining more than 100 percent of the rise in the aftertax income share of the top 1 percent.4  Percentagepoint contribution of growing concentration within each income category to increasing top 1 income share  Percentagepoint contribution of shift from less to moreconcentrated income categories to increasing top 1 income share Source Authors analysis of Congressional Budget Office 2016 The first block of columns simply shows the top 1 percent share of overall household income and of various income types as identified in CBO 2016. A clear finding is that the top 1 percent share of every source of income except government transfers rose significantly between 1979 and 2007. The share of overall income held by the top 1 percent more than doubles rising from 8.9 to 18.7 percent of total income between 1979 and 2007. And even with the enormous blow to top 1 percent incomes dealt by the 40 percent loss in the stock market from 2007 to 2010 the top 1 percent share in 2012 of 17.3 percent was almost double its 1979 level. Particularly salient to this analysis is the rough doubling of both labor and total capital shares claimed by the top 1 percent from 1979 to 2007 and 2012. The next block of columns shows each income category s share of overall household income. The most striking finding here is the large decline in the labor compensation share of total income falling from 70.6 percent in 1979 to 61.0 percent in 2007 and 2012. Correspondingly the share of total capital and business income driven by capital gains and business income rose substantially from 17.5 percent in 1979 to 22.1 percent in 2007.5 Due to the stock market crash in 2007 and the hangover from that crash through 2010 capital income shares and thus total capital and business income remained lower in 2012 than in 2007 but still above the 1979 levels. Finally pension payments and transfer incomes have risen steadily over time as shares of total income. The third block of columns calculates how much growing concentration within each income category contributed to the increasing top 1 percent share of income from 1979 to 2007 and from 1979 to 2012. The growing concentration of particular income types in the top 1 percent of households contributed 7.2 percentage points to the 9.8 percentagepoint increase in the top 1 percent s income share from 1979 to 2007 accounting for essentially three quarters of the rise. The vast majority of this concentration within income sources is accounted for by labor and capital incomes. The last block of columns summarizes how much the shift from lessconcentrated labor income to moreconcentrated capital incomes boosted the top 1 percent share of overall household income. The sum of these shifts contributed 2.6 percentage points to the growth of the top 1 percent share from 1979 to 2007 and 0.4 percentage points from 2007 to 2012. One way to summarize what these data tell us is that the vast majority of households those outside the top 1 percent are losing out in claiming their proportionate share of total income growth in two significant ways. First workers as a group are losing out to capital owners with the shift from labor to capital income explaining a significant portion of the rise of the top 1 percent. Second the bottom 99 percent of income earners in America are able to claim only an evershrinking portion of the overall wage bill with the highestpaid workers in the top 1 percent more than doubling their share of labor income over the last three and a half decades. In our view these are simply two sides of the same coin a pronounced reduction in the collective and individual bargaining power of ordinary American workers that led to pay growth lagging productivity so badly in recent decades. If wages of the bottom 99 percent had kept pace with productivity growth for most of the past generation the way that typical workers wages did in the postWWII generation then most of the increase in income inequality we have seen simply would not have had space to develop as concentration within labor incomes would not have grown and the share of total output available to be claimed by capital owners would have been significantly smaller.6 But wages for the vast majority of workers stopped keeping pace with economywide productivity growth in the late 1970s and the cumulative wedge between productivity and typical workers pay has risen ever since as shown below in Figure A. This figure shows growth in economywide productivity defined as the amount of income and output generated in an average hour of work in the economy. While the pace of productivity growth slowed down in the late 1970s productivity still grew steadily in the following decades. The figure also shows a measure of hourly pay including both wages and benefits for production and nonsupervisory workers in the U.S. economy. This nonmanagerial group includes roughly 80 percent of the privatesector workforce. After growing right in line with productivity for decades following World War II hourly pay for these workers all but stagnated after 1979. Because productivity kept growing but pay for 80 percent of the privatesector workforce stagnated this means that the economy continued to generate growing incomes on average each year but pay for typical workers slowed radically. In short the growing wedge between these lines represents the disproportionate share of economic growth claimed by those at the top after 1979. Note Data are for compensation wages and benefits of productionnonsupervisory workers in the private sector and net productivity of the total economy. Net productivity is the growth of output of goods and services less depreciation per hour worked. Shaded areas denote recessions.

Table 1 and Figure A together tell a clear story about the rise in American inequality it has been made possible by the suppression of wage growth for the vast majority of American workers. Until this wage suppression ends and hourly pay for the vast majority of workers begins rising in lockstep with economywide productivity there is very little reason to hope that rising inequality can be arrested. This makes focusing policy attention on boosting wage growth absolutely crucial. A useful if admittedly toosimple way to think about an economy s growth is as an interplay between the economy s productive capacity and the level of aggregate demand. The economy s productive capacity is a measure of potential that includes three major inputs of production the labor force the capital stock and the state of technology. However for these potential inputs to be fully utilized aggregate demand or spending by households businesses and governments must be strong enough to mobilize them. Take the example of a hotel s economic fortunes from 2007 to 2010. In 2007 the building and physical plant existed the systems for taking reservations existed and there were plenty of workers both actual employees and potential workers willing to take jobs at the right wages. Also in that year there were customers rooms were likely booked to capacity and the owners may have even considered adding rooms. In 2010 this hotel still had a physical plant and reservation systems and while their own staff was likely much smaller because of layoffs in the wake of the Great Recession there was a huge increase in potential workers looking for jobs that could have been hired. But what kept the hotel s hiring constrained and profits low in 2010 was lack of customers not slow growth in the economy s potential or productive capacity. Recently a number of economists have noted that evidence over recent decades indicates that growth has been constrained more by slow growth in aggregate demand than by slow growth in the economy s productive capacity. For example the full business cycle between the peaks of 2001 and 2007 saw the slowest economic growth then on record. The result of this slow growth was that the unemployment rate never returned to prerecession levels and the primeage employmenttopopulation EPOP ratio never approached prerecession levels. See Bivens and Irons 2008 for a full accounting of this business cycle s place in historical comparisons. All of this indicates that the slow growth that took hold even before the Great Recession hit was likely a function of tooslow growth in aggregate demand or spending by households businesses and governments. Before the Great Recession most macroeconomists would have rejected the idea that economic growth could be constrained for long periods of time by tooslow demand growth relative to the economy s productive capacity. The typical view was that growth in productive capacity was driven by longrun trends that did not change very fast such as the aging of the population which determines the pace of potential labor force growth the accumulation of plants equipment and buildings that is the result of decades of past investment and accelerations and decelerations of technology that were largely exogenous unrelated to the state of the business cycle. In this view ensuring that growth in productive capacity or growth in potential GDP is fully realized essentially means ensuring that aggregate demand grows quickly enough to keep resources labor and capital fully employed. In past decades policymakers considered it relatively easy to keep aggregate demand growing fast enough high enough to fully utilize the economy s productive capacity. In fact macroeconomic policymakers thought their most difficult task was restraining not boosting growth in aggregate demand. When aggregate demand for economic output outstrips the economy s productive capacity to meet that demand the result is inflation. So policymakers focused on controlling inflation or ensuring that aggregate demand did not run chronically too fast. Of course the U.S. economy underwent recessions during which demand growth lagged behind potential GDP growth but it was thought that the demand shortfalls could be easily solved by the Federal Reserve reducing shortterm interest rates to spur more spending. Because aggregate demand was thought to need policy restraint not stimulus this implies that overall growth was constrained by how fast the economy s productive capacity could grow. Any worry that persistently slow growth say lasting more than one year in aggregate demand could be a primary constraint on economic growth over a meaningfully long time period was largely dismissed. We now know that this dismissal was premature and that sluggish demand growth can pull down economic growth for long periods of time. The data show we are in such a period and likely have been for over a decade. The extraordinarily weak GDP growth between 2001 and 2007 was accompanied by decelerating wage growth and low inflation and interest rates. These trends are strong indicators that demand was lagging growth in productive capacity. This weakness in demand was especially striking given that aggregate demand or spending by households businesses and governments was buoyed in those years initially by nearzero interest rates set by the Federal Reserve in the early 2000s and then by an enormous asset bubble in residential real estate that increased household wealth in the mid2000s. The housing bubble burst ushering in the Great Recession. The recovery from that recession was even slower than the recovery from the 2001 recession despite extraordinarily expansionary monetary policy in the wake of the Great Recession. Figure B shows the ratio of actual GDP to potential GDP since 1995. When this ratio is below 1 there is prima facie evidence that aggregate demand is constraining economic growth. As the figure shows this ratio has been well below 1 for most of the past two decades even as monetary policy has been historically expansionary. Note Potential GDP is adjusted to make 1999 a year with no output gap a ratio of 1 on this chart. This adjustment is based on a low and nonaccelerating rate of inflation in that year. Shaded areas denote recessions. Source Author s analysis of data from CBO 2017 Aggregate demand growth has lagged growth in the economy s productive capacity over much of the last two decades even as growth in this productive capacity itself slowed sharply. Crucially there is ample evidence that the degraded growth in potential output is itself another casualty of tooslack demand. It is now wellknown that changes in productive capacity i.e. the supply side of the economy are likely affected by changes in the demandside of the economy. The most obvious example concerns capital investment. When demand is weak customers disappear and workers wages don t grow as fast or grow at all as rising unemployment crushes workers bargaining power. A shortage of customers and weak wage growth blunts the incentive of firms to invest in plants or equipment to expand capacity or save on labor costs. This in turn slows the growth of the economy s capital stock a key input in its productive capacity. Short recessions will leave only a small scar on an economy s productive capacity but there is now ample evidence that longer and steeper recessions can do serious damage to even the economy s potential let alone actual growth. We have clearly seen this dynamic over the past decade.7 Growth in potential GDP has been so much slower than growth that was projected in 2008 for the next decade that forecasters by 2017 have essentially erased 2 trillion annually in potential output from the American economy as shown in Figure C. Note Shaded areas denote recession. Measures of potential output are from the 2008 and 2017 editions of the CBO Budget and Economic Outlook. Source Author s analysis of data from BEA NIPA Table 1.1.6 and the Congressional Budget Office on gross domestic product If even one quarter of this slowing growth in potential GDP is a function of sluggish demand growth affecting the course of the economy in economists terms imposing hysteresis effects then the failure to boost demand to grow in tandem with potential GDP has been an economic calamity costing 500 billion annually.8 Given these stakes a number of researchers have begun looking into this chronic shortage of demand. Some have labeled this secular stagnation which has unfortunately confused many people including many economists by obscuring that this is an argument about aggregate demand not potential GDP. Summers 2016 and Krugman 2013 offer some of the clearest statements about the problem of secular stagnation. Recently the same phenomenon has been recast as a fall in the economy s natural or neutral rate of interest. This has also been referred to as the fall in Rstar or R referencing how this natural or neutral rate of interest is often notated in economics papers.9 The relationship between a chronic shortage of aggregate demand secular stagnation and the fall in the economy s neutral interest rate is straightforward. A decline in aggregate demand growth that is exogenous to interest rates will generally spur the Federal Reserve to reduce interest rates in order to stimulate consumption and investment and keep the economy at full employment. Hence the interest rate consistent with the economy reaching full employment the neutral rate will fall over time if this exogenous drag on demand growth continues or worsens. The evidence that this neutral rate has declined over time is compelling. Figure D shows the federal funds rate FFR as well as showing its average value over recent business cycles. The evidence that the neutral FFR rate has been steadily falling since the 1980s seems quite clear. Notes Data are quarterly averages. Horizontal lines are averages over dates indicated. Shading indicates recessions. Source Author s analysis of Effective Federal Funds Rate data accessed from FRED database in September 2017 There is a relatively straightforward causal link between the rise of inequality and the chronic shortfall of aggregate demand higherincome households have much higher savings rates than low and middleincome households. So as a dollar is transferred from the bottom and middle to the top of the income distribution less of it is spent. When the economy is functioning well reduced consumer spending is offset by increased investment in plants and equipment and demand is hence unaffected. Here is how it could work. The reduced consumption stemming from this redistribution translates mechanically into higher savings. Higher savings in turn puts downward pressure on interest rates and these lower interest rates induce more business investment in plants and equipment. This interest rate adjustment hence ensures that the reduced consumption spending that follows the upward redistribution of income is matched by an increase in investment spending and hence does not constitute a drag on growth in aggregate demand. Keeping demand growth constant in the face of upward redistribution of income requires everlower interest rates consistent with the data highlighted above. But if this neutral rate falls far enough the economy s ability to seamlessly translate lower consumption or higher savings into higher investment spending will be potentially blocked by the zero lower bound ZLB on interest rates. Interest rates cannot be moved below zero or at least not too much below zero for extended periods of time because negative interest rates will just induce households to hold their wealth in cash rather than interestbearing or interestsubtracting! bonds. With the economy s ability to translate additional savings into higher investment blocked at the ZLB further increases in savings will instead show up as unused capacity and output losses rather than interest rates reductions. Figure D showed that the U.S. economy has spent most of the post2001 period hovering perilously close to the ZLB so it is valid to fear that increases in inequality have dragged on growth and will continue to drag on growth. The previous section noted that rising inequality will all else equal slow demand growth as income is transferred to highersavings households at the top of the income distribution. The empirical question is just how much rising inequality has contributed to the decline in aggregate demand growth. Again this decline in demand growth will show up in data as either a slowdown in overall growth or a pronounced decline in the neutral interest rate. Rachel and Smith 2015 using a variety of techniques estimate that the rise in inequality in recent decades will likely depress global interest rates by up to 0.6 percent in coming decades making its importance on par with any other single influence they survey. They also note that while the global interest rate is important countryspecific rates can diverge from global rates due to countryspecific factors. Given that the U.S. economy has seen a larger concentration of income at the top of the distribution than have other advanced countries the effect of inequality on the pace of aggregate demand growth and hence interest rates is likely larger as well. Cynamon and Fazzari 2015 assemble a range of indicators estimating the potential of both rising inequality and rising household debt to act as a brake on demand growth. They highlight the role of rising household debt as a buffer that kept consumption for the bottom 95 percent of households from falling in the face of relatively slow income growth in the preGreat Recession period. This buffer was annihilated by the wealth lost when the housing bubble burst and ushered in the Great Recession in 2008. Cynamon and Fazzari 2015 argue that the decaying effect on demand of the transfer to the top combined with the removal of the debtconsumption buffer can largely explain the slow recovery from the Great Recession. These findings are largely buttressed by Alichi Kantenga and Sole 2016 who use a regressionbased framework to estimate that changes in the American income distribution since 1998 had led to a demanddrag of more than 1 percent of total U.S. GDP by 2013. A key component of an analysis of demand drag caused by rising inequality is the savings rate of rich households. Figure E is constructed in the spirit of Cynamon and Fazzari 2015 but makes some slightly different choices about income definitions and presentation of percentiles. It shows average savings rates from 1989 to 2013 of the bottom fourfifths of the income distribution as well as savings rates of households between the 80th and 90th percentiles between the 90th and 95th percentiles between the 95th and 99th percentiles and of households in the top 1 percent. It replicates a procedure first identified by Maki and Palumbo 2001 to identify savings rates of the richest households. This procedure and our adaption of it uses the Survey of Consumer Finances SCF to calculate each income percentile s share of various asset holdings. It then merges this SCF data on distribution with macroeconomic data from the Financial Accounts of the United States FAUS which shows the net acquisition of various types of assets. The assumption used is that if a given income group held say half of all Treasury bonds in a given year then this group was also responsible for half of the aggregate net acquisition of those bonds in a given year. Multiplying each income group s share of assets by the net acquisition of those assets and summing across all asset types provides an estimate of total assets acquired by each income group in a given year. This gives us a measure of total savings by income group in each year.10 Notes Construction of the data is described in the appendix. Source Author s analysis of data from the Federal Reserve Boards Survey of Consumer Finances SCF the Federal Reserve Boards Financial Accounts of the United States FAUS and Congressional Budget Office data on household income and effective tax rates CBO 2016 For each group s income we again use data on comprehensive household income from the Congressional Budget Office 2016. Unlike Cynamon and Fazzari 2015 we include government transfers in our estimate of household income. This income provides purchasing power to households and this purchasing power absolutely informs households consumption decisions and savings rates. Excluding these transfers from household income gives an estimate of how marketbased income trends by themselves would have affected aggregate demand growth. Including the transfers provides an estimate of how much shifting inequality overall even including the generally equalizing effect of taxes and transfers actually slowed aggregate demand growth in recent decades. The point of Figure E is simply that savings rates vary enormously across the income distribution. The economywide savings rate averaged 11.6 percent from 1989 to 2013 while the savings rate for the top 1 percent averaged 47.4 percent. This large difference in savings rates gives rising inequality a very long lever with which to influence trends in aggregate demand growth. A straightforward backoftheenvelope estimate of how much the redistribution of income toward the top stifled consumption growth involves multiplying each group s share of income in earlier years by its savings rate and sum across groups repeating this procedure for later years and then simply subtracting the later aggregates from the earlier aggregates. Table 2 shows the results of this procedure. Notes Income shares do not sum to 100 percent because the CBO income data includes households with negative incomes. The shares in the table above are effectively income shares of households with positive income. Negative income is never more than 2 percent of total income so this failure to round to 100 has only trivial effects on our calculations. The change in aggregate demand is calculated as the change in income multiplied by one minus the savings rate essentially each income group s average propensity to consume. Source Author s analysis based on data from the Survey of Consumer Finances SCF and the Financial Accounts of the United States FAUS from the Federal Reserve Board and the Congressional Budget Office 2016 The top panel of Table 2 shows the average savings rate for each of the income groups featured in Figure E.11 In the middle panel of the table are estimates of the change in income share of each income group for three overlapping periods 1979 2007 1989 2007 and 1979 2012. Between 1989 and 2007 the share of income claimed by the 95th to 99th percentile of households and the top 1 percent of households rose by 0.6 percent and 6.5 percent respectively. Multiplying each group s change in income share over this period by their average savings rate implies that aggregate consumption spending fell by 3.1 percentage points from 1989 to 2007 due to the redistribution of income upward holding all other influences constant. This figure is found in the bottom panel which shows the demand drag potentially caused by rising inequality for the three periods. While data restrictions keep us from getting average savings rates going back to 1979 as the SCF does not have reliable data before 1989 there was a large redistribution between 1979 and 1989 as well. The implied demand drag of the 1979 2007 and 1979 2012 periods assumes that average savings rates across income percentiles from 1989 to 2013 characterize these periods as well. By 2007 the implied inequalityinduced drag on aggregate demand that began in 1979 amounted to more than 4 percentage points of GDP every year. Even if we measure from 1989 and we take as given the large but almost surely temporary decline in top 1 percent income shares from 2007 to 2012 by 2012 inequality was imposing a drag of over 2 percentage points on aggregate demand growth. It is worth restating that this hit to the level of aggregate demand generated by rising inequality is cumulative this demand drag is occurring each year by 2007 or 2012. This means that other macroeconomic influences must continuously ratchet up to keep demand growth from flatlining. We of course know one of these macroeconomic demand resuscitators the sharp fall in the neutral interest rate. To get a sense of just how large this inequalityinduced drag on aggregate demand had become before the Great Recession hit it s useful to compare it with wellknown policy interventions. Perhaps the bestknown policy effort to boost aggregate demand growth in recent decades has been the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act ARRA of 2009. Passed to help stem the downward spiral of the Great Recession and financial crisis ARRA provided the largest discretionary fiscal stimulus ever provided to the American economy. Its year of peak effectiveness was 2010 when the Congressional Budget Office CBO 2015 estimated it boosted aggregate demand growth and hence GDP growth by between 0.7 and 4.1 percentage points of GDP. This upper bound is roughly in line with the estimates above of the demand drag placed on the U.S. economy by rising inequality by 2007. This means that to fully offset the demand drag stemming from inequality using available policy tools policymakers would need to pass the equivalent of a new ARRA each year. Of course in the years between 1979 and 2007 other influences boosted demand as inequality sapped it. The most obvious influences were asset market bubbles in the stock and housing markets. But absent transitory and damaging influences like large asset market bubbles the scale of policy intervention needed to keep aggregate demand growth constant in the face of rising inequality is absolutely huge. The assertion that a large upward redistribution of income over the past generation has slowed growth in aggregate demand implies an increase in economywide savings because more of overall income is going to households that save more. That is why some skeptics could point to the most commonly referenced measure of economywide savings the personal savings rate estimated each month by the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA in the National Income and Product Accounts NIPA to question our conclusion. Over the past generation this rate has fallen sharply from 9.8 percent in 1979 to just 3.0 percent by 2007. This rate spiked upward during and after the Great Recession as households responded to huge wealth losses by cutting back on spending to rebuild their net worth. This decline in the NIPA savings rate needs to be wrestled with. But both theory and evidence indicate that a falling NIPA personal savings rate can be reconciled with the story of inequality tamping down demand growth. Of all the evidence the strongest support comes from data that suggest that the NIPA personal savings rate is falling at least in part because it does not include a huge source of savings for the wealthy unrealized capital gains. In regards to theory interest rates are set by the interplay of desired savings and investment in the economy not actual savings. It is theoretically possible that because the redistribution of income to the top of the income distribution slowed demand growth by increasing the American households sector desired savings rate this slow demand growth constricted overall economic growth and thereby slowed the growth of actual savings since savings are a function of income growth.12 In regards to data while a crosssectional redistribution of income from the bottom 95 percent to the top 5 percent will unambiguously reduce savings all else being equal holding everything else constant in the real world it is not likely that everything else holds constant. For example as income was shifting to the top 1 percent from 1989 to 2012 there were often periods when these households were reducing their own savings rates over time. As Cynamon and Fazzari 2015 document and the appendix of this paper shows savings rates of top income households are quite volatile. If rich households perceived the shift in income toward themselves over this period as permanent a reduction in savings would have indeed been the textbook economic response. This timeseries behavior of rich households with regard to their savings rates does not change the fact that a shift of income growth between income classes has potentially large effects on demand growth. Importantly even when looking at the lowest savings rate recorded in a single year by top 1 percent households in the Survey of Consumer Finances data between 1989 and 2016 the top 1 percent savings rate is still roughly 10 times higher than the savings rate of the bottom 80 percent. Finally and most importantly it is likely that much of the rise in savings from our decadeslong upward redistribution of income has actually materialized as unrealized capital gains which are not captured by the NIPA personal savings rates. Essentially there are two ways that households accrue net wealth they consume less than the full amount of income they earn and save the remainder or their stock of accumulated past savings gains in value. This gain in value of the stock of accumulated savings is a capital gain. If households sell the asset then they have realized this capital gain. Realized gains are captured in some income sources such as the CBO income data we used in Table 1. But even if a household does not sell the asset as the asset s price increases the household has still seen an increase in wealth due to a rise in unrealized capital gains. The NIPA personal savings rate only measures savings out of current income flows the difference between income and consumption spending in the U.S. household sector. Figure F shows the change in household net worth as a share of GDP. A broader definition of savings sometimes used by economists this measure includes not only current income flows that are not consumed but also the changes to wealth occurring from rising or falling asset prices i.e. unrealized capital gains. This measure shows no obvious downward trend although it clearly has become more volatile in recent years. Source Author s analysis of data from the Financial Accounts of the United States from the Federal Reserve Board FAUS and the National Income and Product Accounts NIPA of the Bureau of Economic Analysis BEA As can be inferred from this data showing no downward trend in net worth even in the face of falling flows of savings out of current income shown in NIPA data capital gains have been large larger than flows of household savings and growing in recent decades. For example as can be seen in Figure G unrealized capital gains on financial assets constituted more than three quarters of the annual rise in household net worth on average between 1979 and 2016. The remaining quarter was contributed by household savings out of current income. Further the rise in capital gains is likely driven by a shift in corporate strategy that has redistributed more profits to shareholding households in the form of stock repurchases and less in dividend payments as shown in Figure H. Dividends and stock repurchases are just two different methods by which corporations can return the benefits of profits to their owners shareholders. If firms decide to repurchase their own stock this bids up the firm s stock price and causes a capital gain. If the firm instead decides to take money that was being used to repurchase stock and use it instead to just pay dividends to shareholders these dividends would show up in the NIPA measure of personal income and would be captured in the personal savings rate. Capital gains again are not measured as personal income and hence the change in corporate strategy to emphasize share repurchases over dividend payments affects measured savings rates. In short much savings among highincome households in recent decades has likely shown up more on corporate balance sheets than on household balance sheets. Further the specific corporate actions most notably the use of profits to repurchase stocks rather than pay dividends has kept most measures of national savings from registering the pronounced increase in wealth deriving from the upward distribution of income. This helps explain why some measures of household savings show strong declines in recent decades even as total income claimed by highincome highsavings households has increased dramatically the extra savings resulting from that upward redistribution may be showing up in places besides household balance sheets.

Recent work has highlighted the possibility that rising inequality constitutes an exogenous shock to aggregate demand growth in the American economy. For years this negative shock could largely be ameliorated by declining interest rates set by the Federal Reserve. But since 2000 the American economy has often found itself with a shortfall of aggregate demand even with shortterm interest rates essentially at zero. This means that further increases in inequality will be damaging indeed to prospects of economic growth over the short and medium term unless some other lever of policy fills in the demand shortfall caused by the upward redistribution of income to highsaving households. Further there is growing evidence that prolonged periods of toolow aggregate demand can damage the economy s productive capacity. Policymakers need to get much more serious about avoiding this vicious spiral of chronic demand shortages caused in part by rising inequality degrading productive capacity. Getting serious would mean adopting a more expansionary monetary and fiscal policy portfolio public investments and expansions to social insurance programs than has been pursued in recent decades. But as Taylor et al. 2015 highlight the scale of upward redistribution of income in recent years would require historically unprecedented changes in taxes and transfers to reverse. They also note that to move the dial on aggregate demand policy efforts to spur wage increases will have to be much more ambitious than the adjustments to the federal minimum wage in recent decades. We need to enact a much larger raise in the minimum wage and advance policies to boost wage growth for workers making substantially more than the minimum wage. This makes the EPI s Raising America s Pay agenda so vital. It proposes a series of policies that together could raise wages for American workers. Pay increases for the bottom 80 percent of households would not just raise the welfare and living standards of these families. Pay increases would also substantially loosen a binding constraint on economic growth the chronic shortfall in aggregate demand. In short boosting pay for America s workers will indeed not only be good for their living standards it would create a healthier economy overall.

The construction of savings rates by income percentile draws heavily on methods pioneered by Maki and Palumbo 2001. Measuring savings rates at the top of the income distribution with the mostused data on consumption income and savings the Consumer Expenditures Survey CEX is difficult because incomes are topcoded to preserve confidentiality. This means that reporting on incomes above a certain threshold is suppressed and instead a single value the topcode is given to all incomes above the threshold. Further much recent evidence suggests that the CEX misses a large amount of consumption spending by the rich see Aguiar and Bils 2015. Maki and Palumbo 2001 turn to the Survey of Consumer Finances to obtain better measures of savings behavior among highincome households. Besides oversampling wealthy households the SCF also provides finegrained income percentile rankings allowing researchers to identify the top 1 percent of households by income. The measure of saving used by Maki and Palumbo 2001 and this paper is the net acquisition of assets. This is calculated by using the SCF to obtain the share of a particular asset that is held by a given income class. Forty percent of equities for example were held by the top 1 percent of income owners in 2013 while 8 percent of residential real estate was held by this top 1 percent. From this acquisition of assets we subtract the acquisition of household debt using the same methodology. Then the SCF shares are applied to data from the Financial Accounts of the United States on the economywide net acquisition of those assets by the household sector. So in 2013 roughly 650 billion in corporate equities was acquired by the U.S. household sector. Assuming that the acquisition was proportional to the crosssectional share held by each income group we can measure asset acquisition by income percentile. Finally we can divide these measures of total asset acquisition or savings by data on incomes from the Congressional Budget Office dataset on effective tax rates and household incomes by percentile. Using the CBO data is one innovation of this paper as it provides a more comprehensive measure of household income by percentile than what has been used by Maki and Palumbo 2001. Figure E in the paper reports the average savings rates by income group between 1989 and 2013. While the relative ranking of savings is apparent in each year of the data there is substantial volatility between individual years in both average savings as well as savings by income group. Much of this volatility seems clearly linked to large movements in asset prices the bubbles in the stock market and residential real estate markets that characterized the late 1990s and early 2000s respectively. Figure A1 shows the estimates for each year of savings by income group. What is apparent is the large swings in savings behavior of the top 1 percent. Between 1989 and 2001 their savings rates declined substantially. From 2001 to 2004 their savings rate increased markedly. However what is also apparent is that the rich always save orders of magnitude more than the bottom 80 percent. Source Author s analysis of data from the Federal Reserve Boards Survey of Consumer Finances SCF the Federal Reserve Boards Financial Accounts of the United States FAUS and Congressional Budget Office data on household income and effective tax rates CBO 2016 1. The estimate is 4 percentage points when measuring how much the drag on demand that began in 1979 was slowing growth by 2007 3.1 percentage points when measuring how much the drag on demand that began in 1989 was slowing growth by 2007 and 2 percentage points when measuring how much the drag on demand that began in 1979 was slowing growth by 2012. 2. In 2016 dollars the federal minimum wage peaked in 1968 at just under 10 or about 25 percent higher than today s federal minimum wage of 7.25. A recent proposal would raise the federal minimum to 15 by 2024 which would be roughly equivalent to 12.50 in 2016 dollars or about 25 percent higher than the 1968 peak Cooper 2017. 3. See Bivens 2016 for the measure of the inequality tax. The 20 percent refers to the peak level of this tax in 2007 and the collapse in top 1 percent incomes following the Great Recession reduced this inequality tax for a number of years. Given that most measures of inequality have begun marching upward post2011 it seems a safe bet that the 2007 level of the inequality tax is either with us again today or will be soon. 4. This analysis focuses on the impact of inequality on demand through 2007 instead of 2012 or 2013 because top incomes by 2012 and 2013 still had not recovered from the combination of the stock and housing markets declines associated with the Great Recession. Including only the stilldepressed top 1 percent shares of 2012 or 2013 in this analysis would underestimate the effect of rising inequality. The latest year we use is 2012 even though income data from 2013 does exist. We chose not to use the 2013 data because of the pronounced incomeshifting for tax reasons that occurred in this year that lowered reported capital incomes. Specifically asset holders shifted capital income realizations to 2012 to avoid some tax changes that were set to become law in 2013. To get a sense of the extent of this taxshifting note that the 2012 top 1 percent share of total income was 17.3 percent a full 2.3 percentage points higher than the 15.0 percent share held by the top 1 percent in 2013. 5. As noted in Mishel et al. 2012 the rise in capital income s share is driven overwhelmingly by a higher profit rate not a rise in capitaloutput ratios. 6. This presumes of course that overall income growth over the period would not have been hurt by not allowing inequality to rise. This is a fair presumption and Bivens 2016 showed that there is no evidence to support worries that a more equal distribution of income growth in the past generation would have somehow impeded average growth rates. 7. See Bivens 2017 and Ball 2014 for some empirical support for the view that prolonged demandside weakness eventually bleeds over into serious damage to the economy s supply side. 8. The difference between potential GDP in 2017 as projected by the CBO in 2008 and potential GDP in 2017 as estimated by the CBO in 2017 is roughly 2 trillion. If the damage inflicted by demand shortfalls that led to the Great Recession and subsequent slow recovery is responsible for a quarter of that gap it would be 500 billion. See Bivens 2017 and Yagan 2017 for examples of how demand weakness has bled into slower growth in potential GDP. 9. Holston Laubach and Williams 2016 provide a recent example of the analysis and labeling of the falling Rstar phenomenon. 10. From a household perspective savings income minus consumption spending by definition must show up as the acquisition of an asset even if that asset is just a larger balance in a checking account. 11. We noted previously in footnote 4 why we do not use 2013 as an endpoint in our analysis of incomes. The savings rates from the SCF are constructed using averages from 1989 to 2013. We use the 2013 data in this case because the SCF is only available every 3 years. 12. The dynamic where an increase in desired savings actually induces a demandshortfall that leads to lower realized savings is wellknown to macroeconomists it has traditionally been called the paradox of thrift. In the decades before the Great Recession it was largely thought to be a theoretical curiosity but Eggersston and Krugman 2012 have noted that it is quite possible particularly when the ZLB binds.

Rising inequality and related disparities and anxieties have been stoking social discontent and are a major driver of the increased political polarization and populist nationalism that are so evident today. An increasingly unequal society can weaken trust in public institutions and undermine democratic governance. Mounting global disparities can imperil geopolitical stability. Rising inequality has emerged as an important topic of political debate and a major public policy concern. Current inequality levels are high. Contemporary global inequalities are close to the peak levels observed in the early 20th century at the end of the prewar era variously described as the Belle poque or the Gilded Age that saw sharp increases in global inequality. Over the past four decades there has been a broad trend of rising income inequality across countries. Income inequality has risen in most advanced economies and major emerging economies which together account for about twothirds of the world s population and 85 percent of global GDP Figure 1. The increase has been particularly large in the United States among advanced economies and in China India and Russia among major emerging economies.   Source Author using data from World Inequality Database.Note Pretax national income. Some data points are extrapolated. Beyond these groups of countries the trend in the developing world at large has been more mixed but many countries have seen increases in inequality. In regions such as Latin America the Middle East and North Africa and subSaharan Africa income inequality levels on average have been relatively more stable but inequality was already at high levels in these regions the highest in the world. Wealth inequality within countries is typically much higher than income inequality. It has followed a rising trend across countries since around 1980 similar to income inequality. Higher wealth inequality feeds higher future income inequality through capital income and inheritance. The increase in inequality has been especially marked at the top end of the income distribution with the income share of the top 10 percent and even more so that of the top 1 percent rising sharply in many countries. This was so particularly up to the global financial crisis of 200809. Those in low and middleincome groups have suffered a loss of income share with those in the bottom 50 percent typically experiencing larger losses of income share. These trends in inequality have been associated with an erosion of the middle class and a decline in intergenerational mobility especially in advanced economies experiencing larger increases in inequality and a greater polarization in income distribution. While withincountry inequality has been rising inequality between countries reflecting per capita income differences has been falling in recent decades. Fastergrowing emerging economies especially the large ones such as China and India have been narrowing the income gap with advanced economies. Global inequality the sum of withincountry and betweencountry inequality has declined somewhat since around 2000 with the fall in betweencountry inequality more than offsetting the rise in withincountry inequality. As withincountry inequality has been rising it now accounts for a much larger part of global inequality about twothirds in 2020 up from less than half in 1980. Looking ahead how withincountry inequality evolves will matter even more for global inequality. Zia Qureshi Cheonsik Woo HyeonWook Kim Zia Qureshi The interplay between the evolution of withincountry inequality and betweencountry inequality coupled with the differential growth performance of emerging and advanced economies in recent decades presents an interesting picture of middleclass dynamics at the global level as depicted by the wellknown elephant curve of the incidence of global economic growth. It shows for the period since 1980 a rising middle class in the emerging world and a squeezed middle class in rich countries. It also shows an increasing concentration of income at the very top of the income distribution globally. Shifting economic paradigms are altering distributional dynamics. Transformative technological change led by digital technologies has been reshaping markets business models and the nature of work in ways that can increase inequality within economies. While the specifics differ across countries this has been happening broadly through three channels more unequal distribution of labor income with rising wage inequality as technology shifts labor demand from routine low to middlelevel skills to new higherlevel skills shift of income from labor to capital with increasing automation and a decoupling of wages from firm profitability and more unequal distribution of capital income with rising market power and economic rents enjoyed by dominant firms in increasingly concentrated and winnertakesall markets. These dynamics are more evident in advanced economies but could increasingly impact developing economies as the new technologies favoring capital and higherlevel skills make deeper inroads there. Globalization international trade offshoring also has contributed to rising inequality within economies especially in advanced economies by negatively affecting wages and jobs of lowerskilled workers in tradable sectors. These sectors increasingly extend beyond manufacturing as digital globalization expands the range of activities including services deliverable across borders. In emerging economies technology is reshaping how international trade affects national inequality. The new technologies born in advanced economies are shifting manufacturing and global value chains toward higher capital and skill intensity. Leading manufacturing firms located in emerging economies and engaged in exporting are adopting these technologies in order to be able to compete diminishing employment generation and wage growth prospects for lessskilled workers from this higherproductivity segment of industry in economies whose factor endowments would warrant less capital and skillintensive technologies and thus limiting the potential of international trade to reduce inequality within these economies by boosting demand for their more abundant factor endowment lessskilled workers. Meanwhile smaller firms that absorb most such workers in these economies remain engaged in lowproductivity activities many in the informal economy and in petty service sectors. Globalization has been a force in recent decades for reducing inequality between economies by expanding export opportunities for emerging economies and spurring their economic growth. But globalization s role in promoting international economic convergence faces new challenges as technological change alters production processes and trade patterns more on this below. Other broad trends in recent decades affecting the distribution of income and wealth include changes in institutional settings such as economic deregulation increasing financialization of economies coupled with a high concentration of financial income and wealth and erosion of labor market institutions such as minimum wage laws and collective bargaining. Moreover the redistributive role of the state has been weakening with declining tax progressivity and with transfer programs facing the pressure of tighter fiscal constraints. Large and persistent increases in inequality within economies are not an inevitable consequence of forces such as technological change and globalization. Much depends on how public policy responds to the new dynamics that these forces generate. In the midst of these common forces of change the rise in inequality has been uneven across countries. The difference lies largely in countries institutional and policy settings and how they have responded. In general looking across countries public policy has been behind the curve. It has been slow to rise to the new challenges to promote more inclusive outcomes from economic change. Public policy to reduce inequality is often viewed narrowly in terms of redistribution taxes and transfers. This is indeed an important element especially in view of the erosion of the state s redistributive role in recent decades. But there is a much broader policy agenda of predistribution that can make the growth process itself more inclusive and produce better market outcomes by promoting wider access to new opportunities for firms and workers and enhancing their capabilities to adjust as market dynamics shift. This latter agenda of reforms spans competition policy and regulatory frameworks to keep markets competitive and inclusive in the digital age innovation ecosystems and technology policies to put innovation to work for broader groups of people digital infrastructure and literacy to reduce the digital divide education and retraining programs to upskill and reskill workers while addressing inequalities in access to these programs and labor market policies and social protection systems to enable workers to obtain a fair share of economic returns and to support them in times of transition. In many of these reform areas the new dynamics that economies are facing call for fresh thinking and significant policy overhaul. Absent more responsive policies to combat inequality the current high levels of inequality are likely to persist or even rise further. Artificial intelligence and related new waves of digital technologies and automation could increase inequality further within countries. Even as new technologies increase productivity and produce greater economic affluence and new jobs and tasks emerge to replace those displaced and so prevent large technological unemployment inequality could reach much higher levels. The economic fallout of the COVID19 pandemic has reinforced some of the inequalityincreasing dynamics. Also a high and increasing concentration of wealth can exacerbate income inequality in a mutually reinforcing cycle. Technological change also poses new challenges to global economic convergence that has reduced inequality between countries in the past couple of decades. Faster growth in emerging economies led by export of manufactures has depended greatly on their comparative advantage in laborintensive manufacturing based on large populations of lowskill lowwage workers. This source of comparative advantage increasingly will erode as automation of lowskill work expands. Emerging economies face the challenge of recalibrating their growth models as technology disrupts traditional pathways to growth and development. Emerging economies growth prospects also face other headwinds including the scarring effects of the pandemic and global supply chain disruptions exacerbated by the war in Ukraine and an unsettled global geopolitical environment which would hit the more tradedependent economies harder. If growth in emerging economies falters the decline in betweencountry inequality will slow which could stall or even reverse the modest decline in global inequality observed since about 2000 if withincountry inequality continues to mount. Climate change is another factor that could worsen inequality within and between countries. Lowincome groups and countries are more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and have less capacity to cope with them. Income and wealth inequality is elevated. In the absence of policies to counter recent trends inequality could rise to still higher levels. High and rising inequality entails adverse economic social and political consequences. Policymakers must pay more attention to the changing distributional dynamics in the digital age and harness the forces of change for more inclusive prosperity. History tells us that large and unabated rises in inequality can end up badly.  Kersten Stamm Dana Vorisek   Sarah E.

The report also includes some findings from a separate survey conducted in early September. The adults who were surveyed are members of Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. Recruiting our panelists by phone or mail ensures that nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. This gives us confidence that any sample can represent the whole U.S. adult population see our Methods 101 explainer on random sampling. To further ensure that each ATP survey reflects a balanced crosssection of the nation the data are weighted to match the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology and the methodology for this report. To create the upper middle and lowerincome tiers used in this report family incomes were adjusted for differences in purchasing power by geographic region and for household size. Respondents were then placed into income tiers using a similar methodology to the Center s previous work on the American middle class Middle income is defined as twothirds to double the median annual income for the survey sample. Lower income falls below that range and upper income falls above it. For more information about how the income tiers were created see the methodology section of this report. With about a month to go before the first caucuses and primaries the issue of economic inequality and how to tackle it remains a focal point in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination and it will likely continue to be a central issue in the general election. About sixinten U.S. adults say there s too much economic inequality in the country these days and among that group most say addressing it requires significant changes to the country s economic system according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Still relative to other issues reducing economic inequality doesn t rank high on the public s list of priorities for the federal government to address. About fourinten say this should be a top priority far smaller than the shares who say the same about making health care more affordable dealing with terrorism or reducing gun violence. Democrats and Democratic leaners are much more likely than Republicans and those who lean to the GOP to say reducing economic inequality should be a top priority for the government 61 vs. 20.1 Similarly Democrats are nearly twice as likely as Republicans to say there s too much economic inequality in the U.S. these days 78 vs. 41. Among those who say there s too much economic inequality seveninten think some amount of inequality is acceptable and this is the case among majorities of Democrats 68 and Republicans 77. About threequarters of Democrats who say there s too much economic inequality 74 say addressing it would require major changes to the economic system and 14 say the system needs to be completely rebuilt. Half of their Republican counterparts say the system requires major changes and 12 think it needs to be rebuilt. In addition to partisan differences the survey finds that views on economic inequality often vary across income levels. For example about half of lowerincome Americans 52 say reducing economic inequality should be a top priority for the federal government to address smaller shares of those with middle 39 or upper incomes 36 agree. And while somewhat similar shares across income groups say there s too much inequality in the country these days 85 of upperincome adults who say this think some amount of inequality is acceptable compared with 72 of those with middle incomes and 59 of those with lower incomes. Asked about what contributes to economic inequality in this country Democrats are more likely than Republicans to point to structural factors such as the tax system 56 of Democrats vs. 30 of Republicans say this contributes a great deal and problems with the U.S. educational system 49 vs. 38. In turn Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that the different life choices people make 60 of Republicans vs. 27 of Democrats and some people working harder than others 48 vs. 22 contribute a great deal to economic inequality. These findings come as economic inequality in the U.S. continues to widen. In 2018 households near the top of the income ladder had incomes that were 12.6 times higher than those near the bottom. By comparison in 1980 households near the top had incomes about nine times the incomes of households near the bottom.2 When it comes to wealth accumulation only those families ranked in the top 20 in terms of net worth have gained back the wealth lost during the Great Recession. Today the median net worth of those families is 13 higher than it was in 2007 while the net worth of families in the 20th to the 40th percentiles of the wealth distribution is 39 lower than in 2007 according to Pew Research Center analysis of government data.3 The nationally representative survey of 6878 U.S. adults was conducted online from Sept. 1629 2019 using Pew Research Center s American Trends Panel.4 Among the other key findings About twothirds of Americans who think there s too much economic inequality in the country these days 66 say the federal government should have a lot of responsibility in reducing it and 62 say large businesses and corporations should have a lot of responsibility in this area. About half 52 say state governments should have a lot of responsibility in reducing inequality and 46 say the same about wealthy individuals. By doubledigit margins Democrats who say there s too much economic inequality in the country are more likely than their Republican counterparts to say the state or federal government corporations and wealthy individuals should have a lot of responsibility in reducing inequality. Fully threequarters of Democrats who say there s too much economic inequality say the federal government should have a lot of responsibility in reducing it compared with 44 of Republicans who say there s currently too much inequality. Most adults who say there s too much economic inequality in the U.S. say ensuring workers have the skills they need for today s jobs 62 and increasing taxes on the wealthiest Americans 60 would do a great deal to reduce inequality regardless of whether or not they personally support these measures. More than fourinten say making college tuition free at public two and fouryear colleges and universities expanding Medicare to cover Americans of all ages increasing the federal minimum wage and eliminating college debt would do a great deal to reduce economic inequality. Republicans and Democrats who say there s too much economic inequality in the country have widely different views on the extent to which various measures would be effective in reducing inequality although majorities in both groups say ensuring workers have the right job skills would do a great deal in this regard 56 of Republicans and 65 of Democrats say this. Among those who say there s too much inequality only one of ten measures tested reducing illegal immigration is seen by a larger share of Republicans 45 than Democrats 8 as something that would do a great deal to reduce it. More than eightinten adults who say there s too much economic inequality 84 including similar shares across income groups say the government should raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans in order to address inequality in this country. Democrats who say there s too much inequality 91 are more likely than Republicans 65 who say the same to say the government should raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans in order to address economic inequality but majorities of both groups share this view. At the same time 86 of Americans who say there s too much economic inequality in the country these days say that the government should not raise taxes on people like them in order to address the issue. Just 12 say the government should raise taxes on people like them. Among Americans with the highest incomes a subset of upper income adults who are in the top 7 of the sample s adjusted income distribution about a third 34 of those who say there s too much economic inequality say the government should raise taxes on people like them to deal with this while 64 say this should not be done. Twothirds of Americans who say there s too much economic inequality in the U.S. think addressing this inequality requires major changes to the economic system and another 14 think the economic system needs to be completely rebuilt 19 say the economic system requires only minor changes in order to address economic inequality. Among those who think there s too much economic inequality Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the economic system needs major changes to address inequality 74 vs. 50. In turn 36 of Republicans vs. 11 of Democrats say the economic system needs only minor changes. Among Republicans who see too much economic inequality those with lower incomes are particularly likely to say the U.S. economic system needs major changes in order to address this inequality 63 say this compared with 48 of middleincome and 43 of upperincome Republicans. Income differences are less pronounced among Democrats who say there s too much economic inequality although those with lower incomes 18 are more likely than those with middle 13 and upper 8 incomes to say the economic system needs to be completely rebuilt in order to address economic inequality. Eightinten Americans including majorities of Democrats and Republicans say the federal government has a responsibility to provide highquality K12 education to all Americans. More than sixinten also say the government has a responsibility to provide adequate medical care 73 and health insurance 64. Solid majorities of about nineinten Democrats say the government has a responsibility in these areas while about half or fewer among Republicans say the same. Majorities of Democrats but fewer than half of Republicans also say the government has a responsibility to provide adequate income in retirement an adequate standard of living and adequate housing to all Americans. Views on this also vary by income with lowerincome adults more likely than those with middle or upper incomes to say the government has a responsibility to provide each of the eight items asked about in the survey. To create upper middle and lowerincome tiers respondents 2018 family incomes were adjusted for differences in purchasing power by geographic region and for household size. Middleincome adults live in families with annual incomes that are twothirds to double the median family income in our sample after incomes have been adjusted for the local cost of living and for household size. The middleincome range for this analysis is about 40100 to 120400 annually for a threeperson household. Lowerincome families have incomes less than roughly 40100 and upperincome families have incomes greater than roughly 120400. Based on these adjustments among respondents who provided their income 31 are lower income 46 are middle income and 17 fall into the upperincome tier. See the methodology for more information about how the income tiers were determined. Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2020/01/09/views-of-economic-inequality/, Roughly fourinten Americans 42 say reducing inequality should be a top priority for the federal government. Among this group large majorities say the influence it gives to the wealthy and the limits it places on people s opportunities are major reasons why inequality should be given priority status. Relative to other issues though the public does not rank inequality among the country s biggest problems. Views on economic inequality differ significantly by party and by household income. And they differ by income within party coalitions particularly among Republicans. Overall 61 of Americans say there is too much economic inequality in the country today. Roughly a quarter 23 say the country has about the right amount of inequality and 13 say there is too little inequality. Across income groups the public is about equally likely to say there is too much economic inequality. However upper 27 and middleincome Americans 26 are more likely than those with lower incomes 17 to say that there is about the right amount of economic inequality. Lowerincome adults are more likely than those with middle and upper incomes to say there s too little inequality. Views on this differ substantially by party. About fourinten Republicans and those who lean toward the Republican Party 41 say there is too much inequality compared with roughly eightinten Democrats and Democratic leaners 78. Instead Republicans 43 are much more likely than Democrats 7 to say there is about the right amount of economic inequality in the country these days. There are also differences by income tier within each party. Lowerincome Republicans are more likely than higherincome Republicans to say there s too much inequality in the country today 48 vs. 34. In turn higherincome Republicans are more likely than those with lower incomes to say there is the right amount of inequality 54 vs. 28. Among Democrats majorities in all income groups say there is too much economic inequality. But higherincome Democrats are more likely to express concern over this issue 93 of upperincome Democrats say there s too much economic inequality in the country today compared with 84 of middleincome Democrats and 65 of lowerincome Democrats. Most Americans who see too much inequality in the country say that major changes are needed in order to address the issue. About twothirds 67 say this while 14 say the system needs to be completely rebuilt. Roughly oneinfive 19 say that only minor changes are required in order to address inequality. Among those who say there is too much inequality lowerincome Americans are the most likely to say the system needs to be completely rebuilt 18 say this compared with 13 of middleincome adults and 8 of those in the upperincome tier. Across income groups roughly equal shares say the system will require major changes. Again there are differences by party. About a third of Republicans who say there is currently too much economic inequality 36 say that only minor changes are required to fix the problem. Only 11 of Democrats who see too much inequality say the same. Instead 74 of these Democrats think major changes are needed to fix the issue compared with half of their Republican counterparts. Republicans views about how much work is needed to address economic inequality differ by income. A majority of lowerincome Republicans who see too much inequality 63 say major changes are needed in order to address the issue. By comparison only 43 of upperincome Republicans who see too much inequality say the same. About oneinten lower income Republicans 14 say the system needs to be completely rebuilt in order to address inequality. Among Democrats there is generally more agreement across income groups. Upper and lowerincome Democrats who say there is too much inequality largely agree that the system requires major changes 78 among upperincome and 72 among lowerincome. Even so lowerincome Democrats are more likely than middle and upperincome Democrats to say the system needs to be completely rebuilt. While most Americans say there is too much economic inequality in the country these days many are willing to accept some level of it. Among those who say there is too much inequality 70 say some amount is acceptable. About threeinten 29 say no amount is acceptable. Across all income groups majorities of those who say there s too much economic inequality say that some amount is acceptable. Still upperincome Americans 85 are more likely to say this than those with middle 72 or lower incomes 59. Among lowerincome Americans who say there is too much inequality 40 say that no amount of economic inequality is acceptable in the country. Republicans and Democrats who say there is too much economic equality are largely in agreement on this point. Majorities from each group say some inequality is acceptable 77 among Republicans and 68 among Democrats. When asked about 11 major issues facing the country today concern about economic inequality ranks around the middle of the pack with 44 saying this is a very big problem. By comparison about twothirds say the affordability of health care 66 and drug addiction 64 are very big problems. The affordability of college the federal budget deficit and climate change are also viewed as big problems by higher shares of adults. Inequality is roughly on par with concerns about illegal immigration and racism. And more view it as a very big problem than say the same about terrorism sexism and job opportunities for all Americans. Adults with lower incomes are more likely than those with middle or upper incomes to say that economic inequality is a very big problem in the country today. About half of lowerincome adults 53 say this compared with 41 of middleincome Americans and 42 of those with higher incomes.17 Concern over economic inequality also varies by partisanship. Twothirds of Democrats compared with just 19 of Republicans say inequality is a very big problem in the country today. Again Republicans views on this differ significantly by income. Lowerincome Republicans 35 are much more likely than their middleincome 15 and higherincome 8 counterparts to say that economic inequality is a very big problem. Among Democrats majorities of upper middle and lowerincome adults say economic inequality is a very big problem. Upperincome Democrats are somewhat more likely than lowerincome Democrats to express this view 71 vs. 63. Just as economic inequality doesn t rise to the top of the list of very big problems according to the American public it s not viewed as the most pressing policy priority for the federal government to address. About fourinten U.S. adults 42 say that reducing economic inequality should be a top priority for the federal government placing it lower on the list than making health care more affordable 72 dealing with terrorism 65 reducing gun violence 58 and climate change 49 and roughly equivalent to reducing illegal immigration 39. The degree to which Americans see reducing income inequality as a priority differs by income and by party. Adults with lower incomes are more likely than those with middle and upper incomes to say this should be a top priority. And by a margin of roughly threetoone Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say the same 61 vs. 20. Among Republicans differences by income tier persist. While few Republicans overall say economic inequality should be a top government priority lowerincome Republicans are far more likely than higherincome Republicans to say this 35 vs 9. Democrats on the other hand are united across income tiers. About sixinten Democrats across income groups say that reducing economic inequality should be a top priority for the federal government. For those who say reducing inequality should be a government priority large majorities point to unfair access it affords the wealthy and limits it places on others When Americans who say reducing economic inequality should be a top priority for the federal government are asked why they believe that 87 say inequality limits people s opportunities. A similar share 86 says a major reason why reducing inequality should be a priority is that inequality gives the wealthy too much political influence and access. About seveninten 71 point to the harmful effect inequality has on economic growth while 55 say inequality goes against the country s values. Views on why reducing inequality should be a top priority for the federal government differ somewhat by party. For example 89 of Democrats who say reducing inequality should be a top priority say the fact that inequality limits people s opportunities is a major reason why it should be addressed while 79 of Republicans say the same. Majorities of Republicans and Democrats who say reducing inequality should be a top priority also point to inequality giving the wealthy too much political influence and access and being harmful to economic growth as major reasons why they think reducing inequality should be a priority.

AbstractIncreasing economic inequality in recent years has triggered an outpouring of analysis and reflection on the causes and consequences of these changes. Several commentators have argued that inequality does not merit all the attention it has been receiving noting that the focus on inequality can divert attention from the real problem which is poverty. This article reviews the arguments for and against this position highlighting the effects of economic inequality on economic growth and efficiency politics and democracy individual behaviors that result in poor health outcomes and social disruption social cohesion and environmental degradation. Poverty is of course a very important social issue but this review of the arguments about inequality shows that economic inequality in itself is also an important social ill that should be addressed.Keywords income inequality wealth inequality economic growth democracy health social cohesion environmental degradation Peterson E.W.F.Is Economic Inequality Really a Problem?
