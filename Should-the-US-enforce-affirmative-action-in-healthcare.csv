https://blog.amopportunities.org/2023/07/06/the-need-for-affirmative-action/, On March 6 1961 President John F. Kennedy signed Executive Order 10925 a bill that in part would lead to the creation of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. E.O. 10925 also mandated that federally funded projects must take affirmative action to keep their hiring processes free from racial bias. In the U.S. where civil rights activists had nearly a decade of increased activity around the country E.O. 10925 foreshadowed the larger impact protests would have on reshaping civil rights at the federal level. E.O. 10925 is also the first instance of the phrase affirmative action used in federal documents. When he succeeded Kennedy President Lyndon B. Johnson continued Kennedy s work of creating equal opportunities for racial and gender minorities in spaces of education and employment. Johnson s contributions to affirmative action culminated in signing Executive Order 11246 on September 24 1965 which required federal contractors to implement measurable steps into their hiring processes that increased racial diversity. In 1967 this E.O. would be expanded to include gender. Four months before signing E.O. 11246 Johnson gave a graduation speech at Howard Univesity a historically black university in Washington D.C. and the alma mater of some of the most recognizable names in U.S. culture and politics TaNehisi Coates Elijah Cummings Toni Morrison and Kamala Harris. During his speech Johnson gave the clearest articulation to date of affirmative action s purpose saying  You do not wipe away the scars of centuries by saying now you are free to go where you want do as you desire and choose the leaders you please. You do not take a man who for years has been hobbled by chains liberate him bring him to the starting line of a race saying you are free to compete with all the others and still justly believe you have been completely fair . . . This is the next and more profound stage of the battle for civil rights. We seek not just freedom but opportunity not just legal equity but human ability not just equality as a right and a theory but equality as a fact and as a result.  Throughout the rest of the 1960s and into the 1970s affirmative action existed uninhibited changing the way a generation of Americans would experience education and employment. However by 1978 affirmative action was challenged for the first time finding itself the focal point of a Supreme Court case California v. Bakke that wrongfully warned of affirmative action leading to reverse discrimination hiring practices at the cost of the racial majority. In this case the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a white medical school applicant and claimed that affirmative action violated the Equal Protection Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment a measure separate from Kennedy s Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Not only would this decision open the door for a number of highprofile challenges to affirmative action throughout the 20th and early 21st centuries it would also be a precedent for last week s Supreme Court decisions on Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina that prioritized a longstanding conservative social belief that misunderstands racial discrimination in the U.S. as harmful to white people. The decisions are an end to affirmative action as the U.S. had known it. Diversity s impact on healthcare is no secret. From improved patient outcomes to better cultural competency throughout care diverse physician workforces administrative leaders nursing teams and more help not just improve community care but improves access to care. According to 2021 AAMC data 64 percent of U.S. physicians were white a rate only slightly higher than the 58.9 percent of Americans per 2022 U.S. census estimates. However for black and Hispanic Americans who account for 13.6 percent and 19.1 percent of the U.S. population physician rates are much lower. Black physicians account for just 5.7 percent of the U.S. physician workforce and Hispanic physicians just 6.9 percent. Whether race or gender it research has proven that patients prefer a physician who looks like them. There are even improved health outcomes among patients of the racial minority who receive care from a physician of the same race. For two of the U.S. biggest minority populations this means that finding their preferred physicians is not just less accessible but less likely than it is for white patients. Beyond means of inclusion in employment and education institutions affirmative action functions in the larger social sphere through instances like access to care educators who share identities with their students actors in movies and beyond. Due in large part to affirmative action the growth of black and Hispanic medical school matriculants for the 20222023 school year outpaced the medical school average. You can read the report from the AAMC here. The end to affirmative action is an end to the momentum of the growth in minority matriculants into U.S. medical schools which in a few years time will be noticed in the rate of black Hispanic Asian and Native physicians entering the workforce. There is a healthcare worker shortage in the United States. To help address it efforts have grown over the past few decades to increase access for foreigntrained physicians to the U.S. workforce. Graduates of international medical schools now account for nearly 25 percent of the U.S. workforce and they come from countries like India Ghana Japan Pakistan China Brazil and beyond. That is to say most internationallytrained physicians are not white and European but come from a wide network of countries and bring a spectrum of diverse identities to the U.S. healthcare system. Even today statelevel bills some even proposed by Republican lawmakers recognize the untapped skills of nonpracticing internationallytrained healthcare workers already in the U.S. and aim to expand their access to jobs in the U.S. workforce. These efforts are not one of taking opportunity away from more qualified workers as is the case often made against affirmative action but filling a need with trained qualified and skilled healthcare workers. Without affirmative action the contributions of foreigntrained doctors to the U.S. healthcare workforce are as equally at risk as black Hispanic Native and Asian physicians born and trained in the U.S. The Supreme Court s decision to deem affirmative action an illegal practice is a decision contradictory to furthering the progress of civil rights. It is not a decision rooted in the principle of equity. AMO condemns the U.S. Supreme Court s decisions in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard University and Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina and will continue to work toward creating a healthcare system that is representative and inclusive for patients and physicians of all identities.     document.getElementById ak_js_1 .setAttribute value new Date .getTime  ABOUT AMO Our Story Contact FAQs EXPLORE ROTATIONS Create an Account How It Works Search
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11606-023-08545-1,  5 Altmetric Explore all metrics  Affirmative action relates to procedures that seek to eliminate discrimination and to support those that have been historically discriminated against. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 sought to reduce disparities by applying affirmative action practices to educational institutions.1 Even prior to the 2023 Court decision banning racebased affirmative action in higher education the practice had been challenged at both federal and state levels. Starting with California in 1996 in total nine states had already banned racebased affirmative action in higher education.2 On the federal level starting in 1978 with Bakke and reaffirmed in the landmark 2003 Grutter case the Court recognized that a diverse student body is a compelling government interest and creates educational benefits. Therefore a raceconscious affirmative action admission policy was considered to pass constitutional muster. However the Court placed guardrails around the use of race in admission policies and required affirmative action plans to be narrowly tailored. In Grutter the Court defined five hallmarks of a narrowly tailored affirmative action plan 1 the absence of quota 2 individualized consideration of applicants 3 serious goodfaith consideration of raceneutral alternatives to the affirmative action program 4 that no member of any racial group was unduly harmed and 5 that the program had a sunset provision or some other end point. In reference to the fifth point the Court arbitrarily chose 25 years as the anticipated end point of when affirmative action would be necessary to advance this governmental interest.3 4 The Grutter precedent was successfully challenged in two separate cases filed by Students for Fair Admissions Inc. SFFA one against Harvard and another against the University of North Carolina UNC alleging violation of the Equal Protection Clause and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 based on these institutions use of race as a factor in their admission decisions. The Court held that admission practices that use race as a factor violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Referencing Grutter s 25year anticipated sunset provision the Court noted that the challenged admission policies had no end in sight. Therefore in June 2023 a full 5 years before Grutter had anticipated the potential end of raceconscious affirmative action this longstanding precedent was overturned and raceconscious affirmative action was deemed no longer permissible. Nonetheless the Court recognized that the student s individual experiences which their race may have shaped can still be used in admission decisions.5 Though the percentage of bachelor s degrees awarded to historically underrepresented groups HUGs increased from 10 in 1976 to 36 in 2021 there was a concurrent tripling of these populations which have been historically discriminated against from approximately 13 of the US population in 1975 to an estimated 35 40 data confounded by introduction of mixedrace categories in US census as well as change in age categories.6 This relative flat rate of bachelor s degree attainment by HUGs is supported further by discrete analysis by Long and Bateman of the University of California Berkeley.7 The authors shared that despite the percentage of HUG high school graduates in California rising from 37 to 55 from 1994 to 2015 the percent of HUGs applying to University of California campuses in the same time period remained fairly flat. Additionally there was a large decline in the percentage of HUG admitted students immediately after the California ban.7 Census data from 2016 indicates that Black or African American people comprised approximately 13 Hispanic people comprised approximately 18 and American Indian and Alaska native people comprised 0.15 of the nation s population.8 Yet over the last four decades leading to 2016 allopathic schools saw Black or African American matriculants increase from 6 to only 7.1 Hispanic or Latino matriculants increase from 4.9 to just 6.3 and American Indian and Alaska Native matriculants decline from 0.4 to 0.3 of all matriculants.9 US osteopathic school matriculant data in 2016 was similarly discordant from census data with less than 10 of matriculants from HUGs.10 In addition to disproportionate underrepresentation of HUGs in medical schools in the years since statelevel bans on affirmative action were instituted public medical schools in ban states had significant reductions in the percentage of HUG students compared to the years prior to ban implementation. HUG enrollment in public medical schools in banned states decreased by 4.8 percentage points 5 years after ban implementation while adjusted percentage in control schools in nonban states increased by 0.7 percentage points.11 The recent Court ruling has the potential to amplify this effect on HUG enrollment nationally. The current lack of diversity in our medical workforce was not accidental. In addition to segregation and lack of access to quality education the Flexner report led to the closure of historically Black medical schools which has continued impact today.12 As such a passive approach toward righting this problem will not solve it. Just as policies have created the current inequities that we see today it is imperative that support for new programs to correct the issue be generated. Affirmative action has been viewed as a positive force moving our entire medical system closer to diversity and increasing racial and ethnic representation in the medical workforce.13 However given persistent disproportionate underrepresentation of HUGs one might argue that though beneficial affirmative action has not been sufficient to bring accurate representation of the US population to the medical workforce. Recognizing diversity as a priority the National Institutes of Health issued the Notice of Interest in Diversity encouraging diversification of the workforce in biomedical and social sciences with respect to raceethnicity as well as other underrepresented populations i.e. individuals with disabilities andor lower socioeconomic status.14 The bodies that oversee the education of medical students and residents not only support but require diversity in our schools and training programs. The Liaison Committee on Medical Education mandates A medical school recognizes the benefits of diversity and promotes students attainment of competencies required of future physicians. A medical school has effective policies and practices in place and engages in ongoing systematic and focused recruitment and retention activities to achieve missionappropriate diversity outcomes among its students faculty administrative staff and other relevant members of its academic community .15 The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education requires that residency programs engage in practices that focus on missiondriven ongoing systematic recruitment and retention of a diverse and inclusive workforce of residents fellows faculty and other relevant members of its academic community. It also mandates that residents demonstrate competence in respect and responsiveness to diverse patient populations.16 With these varied mandates and the larger cultural dialog around race in the USA many medical schools and residency training programs had moved toward a raceconscious recruitment and enrollment process so that HUG trainees are more equitably represented in the physician training pathway. The benefits of wider representation of HUGs in medicine are clear patientphysician concordance improves communication quality of care and adherence to treatment plans.171819 Students from HUGs are more interested in practicing in geographic areas underserved in healthcare and underserved groups are more likely to be cared for by physicians that identify as HUGs.20 21 In addition diverse teams produce better science which furthers technological advances in healthcare.22 Diversity in medical student bodies benefits patients from backgrounds that are congruent with HUGs in medicine. Also students trained at schools with diverse student bodies are more comfortable treating patients from different racial and ethnic backgrounds therefore improving care for all patients that they encounter.23 Moreover white students who train in schools with more diverse student bodies are more prepared to provide equitable care to patients.24 In addition to improved clinical care of patients racial diversity positively impacts the students educational experience. For instance students from top medical schools report that diversity in their classmates improved their educational experience and their ability to treat patients with diverse backgrounds within clinical settings. Importantly medical students surveyed anonymously strongly supported affirmative action policies to admit more underrepresented students.23 In the absence of affirmative action we must employ and strengthen other effective mitigation strategies to help improve diversity. Some schools have been recognized for improving diversity despite affirmative action bans in their states examining their processes can be of great benefit to all medical programs. For example University of California Davis School of Medicine increased enrollment of HUG students from 10 in 2006 to 52 in 2020 after implementing multilevel structural changes to the admission process including emphasis on metrics alternative to test scores such as a socioeconomic disadvantage score.25 Institutions can create similar rubrics measuring life experiences such as family hardships employment caregiver experience community service volunteerism leadership roles and other characteristics of excellence. They can individualize these rubrics to best align with their mission and the needs of the patients they serve. Other approaches to improve diversity can include targeted outreach to underrepresented communities and pathway programs where medical schools partner with undergraduate institutions and high schools to support students as well as financial aid and scholarships to students from underrepresented groups. Diversity training for faculty and staff involved in medical education from use of bias mitigation tools by admissions committees to training interviewers how to write unbiased narrative comments is essential. Additionally institutions should enlist a holistic admissions process that incorporates missionaligned selection processes taking into consideration traditional factors as well as an applicant s experiences attributes and personal charactervalues. Programs should also consider the entirety of the application process including use of standardized letters of recommendation to reduce bias and missionaligned filters to select applicants to interview rather than relying on traditional rankings e.g. home school ranking research productivity. Ultimately a multifaceted approach that includes multiple strategies is likely to be most effective in promoting equity in medical school admissions and create a more diverse and inclusive medical school environment. These strategies to increase representation of HUGs cannot exist just in medical schools. Action to increase diversity in undergraduate institutions must also occur. The COVID pandemic forced some institutions to move in a positive direction. In part due to waning enrollment many colleges and universities adopted testoptional policies and most have pledged to maintain their decision with the pandemic s end. During this same time period many institutions abandoned legacy admissions practices noting such practices drive inequity.26 Unfortunately few undergraduate or postgraduate programs are completely transparent with their holistic review processes. To ensure a diverse medical workforce we implore full transparency seeking institutions to indicate to what degree they utilize the holistic approach. Do they use one metric or several and to what degree are those elements weighted with other elements such as prior school ranking GPA test scores etc.? We recognize that not all institutions of higher learning have the same goals and that each applicant must also be viewed by the value they would contribute to the learning environment and mission. To quote Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson deeming race irrelevant in law does not make it so in life .5 As educators and physicians we must work to build a society wherein one s race is no longer a determinant of the quality of healthcare one receives. Increasing the diversity of medical workforce is critical to this mission to the education of our learners and the care of our patients especially those made most vulnerable. Raceconscious affirmative action had been an integral aspect of the recruitment and retention of a diverse trainee pathway. Though many health professions schools implement other methods to increase the matriculation of HUGs these interventions may come too late to adequately overcome external factors of systemic racism on applicants.27 The preclusion or further limitation of holistic review would compound loss of diversity and threaten patients health. Medical institutions must work with our community to ensure that does not happen. Further study must take place to demonstrate the ongoing value of a diversified medical workforce to our learners our physicians and our patients. As current initiatives have failed to deliver progress in improving racial and ethnic diversity in our physician workforce we must consider innovative actions to create change now and for generations to follow.

American Medical Association Chief Experience Officer Todd Unger hosts.  AMA Recovery Plan for America s Physicians After fighting for physicians during the pandemic the AMA is taking on the next extraordinary challenge Renewing the nation s commitment to physicians. Unger Hello and welcome to the AMA Update Video and Podcast series. Today were talking about the Supreme Courts ruling on affirmative action and its impact on medical education. Im joined by Dr. Sanjay Desai AMAs chief academic officer and group vice president of medical education in Chicago. We also have Dr. Dave Henderson AMAs vice president for equity diversity and belonging in medical education calling in from West Hartford Connecticut. Im Todd Unger AMAs chief experience officer also in Chicago. Dr. Desai Thank you so much Todd for having us here for this important topic. Dr. Henderson Thank you very much Todd. Its great to be here. Unger Dr. Desai lets start with you first a little background with its ruling on affirmative action the Supreme Court has upended decades of legal precedent which will have a significant impact on higher education including medical education. Dr. Desai can you start by giving us an overview of the courts ruling? Dr. Desai Sure Todd. I think hopefully as many people have probably read by now in the news last Thursday almost a week ago the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action programs at the University of North Carolina and at Harvard University judging it illegal to use race as a consideration in the admissions process. They essentially ruled that it violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. The vote was 6 to 3 in the case with University of North Carolina and 6 to 2 in the case with Harvard because Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson recused herself from that latter case. Unger Now the AMA has been tracking this case and actually filed an amicus brief. Dr. Desai tell us a little bit more about that and the AMA stance on the ruling. Dr. Desai The AMAs had a loud voice in this. We joined more than 40 other organizations alongside the amicus brief that was filed by the Association of American Colleges and essentially urged the Supreme Court Todd to take no action that would disrupt the admissions processes that the nations health professional schools have carefully crafted in reliance on this courts long standing precedents. You refer to the precedents yourself and that amicus brief was cited by the dissenting justices in their comments on this case. And we feel policies that permit race as a component of selection are critical to diversifying the health care workforce. Unger Thank you Dr. Desai. Dr. Henderson what impact will this ruling have on medical education and the diversity of future med school classes? Dr. Henderson Well Todd its likely to have a significant impact because affirmative action has been much more effective than any of the other strategies that have been employed. There have been some race neutral strategies that have been employed and have been studied. As an example affirmative action sort of provides about a 20 increase in diversity according to a number of studies. There are also strategies of holistic review that arent inclusive of race and they bump matriculation and diversity in medical schools about 7. In addition there are test optional policies policies that dont require say SAT scores for entry into undergraduate education. And in a study in 2022 they found that they only increased diversity by 1. And there are a number of states that have sort of top 10 of plans states that have passed legislation that allow the students in the top percent of their graduating class in high school to be admitted to any of the state institutions. And in a study of those plans they found a lot of mixed results. Specifically they found that there were many instances in which students sort of underenrolled that is to say they chose institutions other than the top tier schools in their state even though they qualified for admission there. It should also be noted I think that there are large racial gaps in kindergarten readiness between students from affluent neighborhoods and students from poor communities. And these gaps in achievement actually continue throughout K to 12 education. So if you are a poor child if you are from a group thats underrepresented and disadvantaged you have challenges from the time you begin education in this country in kindergarten. Unger So thats quite a pipeline problem that youre talking about there and real concern that a change like this is going to lead to a less diverse medical school class. Now that follows that we might be then seeing a much less diverse physician workforce. Dr. Desai why is that a problem? And why is it an issue when we think about delivering better patient care? Dr. Desai This relates directly to the health of our country. Systemic and structural racism are major contributors to the existing health inequity that we see in this country. Ameliorating racism must be central to our workforce development strategy if we hope to make progress towards achieving health equity. So while our country continues to grow more and more diverse historically marginalized communities have been left behind on nearly every health indicator. A physician workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation is key to eliminating those health inequities. And theres convincing evidence there are data for this Todd theres evidence that racially diverse care teams produce measurably positive health outcomes for patients in historically marginalized populations. Patients in minority communities they demonstrate improved primary care management adherence and health behaviors when clinicians have race concordance. And this has been noted by Justice Jackson in her dissent that racial concordance between high risk Black newborns and physicians was associated with decreases in mortality. And the goal to be clear is not that we create a system of racially segregated care but rather a health care workforce Todd in which racial and ethnic representation is a more common aspect of our care teams. Unger So its clear that diversity can improve patient outcomes. But in most places those outcomes are not yet a reality for patients as youre kind of laying out already. What is the level of diversity in our current physician workforce? And where does it need to be? Dr. Desai In the United States the demographics of the current health care workforce do not align with the demographics of the population. According to the latest data from the Association of American Medical Colleges only 6.9 of physicians in the United States identify as Hispanic while 5.7 identify as Black or African American and only 0.3 of physicians identify as American Indian or Alaska Native. However if you look at the population almost 20 of the U.S. population identifies as Hispanic or Latino over 13 identify as Black or African American. And over 1.3 identify as American Indian or Alaskan Native. And between 1997 and 2017 the number of matriculants to medical school from underrepresented groups declined declined Todd by 16 a big gap. Unger So were already seeing major challenges even with affirmative action in place. Dr. Henderson what are some of the biggest barriers that were up against in getting a more diverse group of medical school applicants and graduates? Dr. Henderson As I sort of alluded to before there are inequities in K12 education in the way that our public education system is structured being funded by local taxes. So if you live in a poor neighborhood you are more likely to attend an underresourced school. I think the issue of diversity in higher education which creates a pipeline that provides matriculants to medical school universities and colleges cant manage the work of diversifying the workforce by themselves. The solution cant be found in a patchwork of state level policies. Action from the federal government is required. And it needs to begin well before high school which is where a lot of pathways programs start. Unger So with all of those kind of barriers that youre outlining and the loss of affirmative action what are some of the ways that medical schools can still increase diversity at their institutions? Dr. Henderson Well I think there are a number of possible options for schools. One option is to advocate within their state for better K to 12 education to eliminate some of the existing inequities. That will take a long time but if successful that will actually create the pipeline or the pathway that is needed. Additionally I think that there needs to be closer collaboration between medical schools and graduate schools in general and their undergraduate institutions locally again to help foster the creation of a pathway. And in addition to that medical schools universities need to really advocate very strongly at a state level for improved education throughout the continuum because that I think is the best way forward for us. Another pool of potential applicants thats often overlooked are students who begin their education in community colleges. I think making inroads and creating relationships with community colleges is another sort of important mechanism for bringing a more diverse applicant pool to medical school admissions. Unger What about lets think about folks that are submitting their applications and having a more holistic review. Whats that look like? Dr. Henderson Well there are a number of approaches for that. And some schools have started to use adversity metrics. It could be said that everyone walks a mile to come to the door of medical education but some people walk much longer miles and much harder miles than others. And I think taking a look at what a given student has had to overcome and taking that into consideration I think can help identify some very worthy students that might be overlooked in more normative race neutral admissions settings. Unger Dr. Desai this is an issue the AMA has been working on long before the Supreme Court decision. Can you talk about how the AMA is supporting efforts to increase diversity in our physician workforce? Dr. Desai Todd as you mentioned this is a core issue for us. Thankfully we have a long standing history of supporting diversity in medical schools. We have a substantial body of policy that supports equity diversity and belonging in medical schools and diversification of the medical student body and using race conscious practices in admissions. In fact at our annual meeting just a month ago this was reaffirmed. Within medical education we work across the AMA with our Center for Health Equity as well as with other areas within the American Medical Association to really do as much as we can to promote the diversification of medical student body and the physician workforce. Some examples include education content so we are leading really the dissemination of health system science. How do we educate our physicians on the health system? And within that there is a core content area related to structural drivers of health where things such as structural racism and the need for a diversified workforce comes in. We also have programming on combating structural racism in both medical schools as well as in residency programs and offer guidance on how to combat these to help our partners who are educating physicians and developing them across the country. We have helped these same universities develop research and action plans to understand the challenges to developing a diversified student body and physician workforce. Weve hosted webinars with experts from across the country to promote awareness in this space and to help disseminate and learn best practices related to this issue. We have a Council of Medical Education Todd thats quite active in the country and theyve produced reports describing promising practices on pathway programs that Dr. Henderson was just describing. Were currently actually leading the creation of a study that is looking at how to embed and promote racial justice in medical education. A component of that will certainly be this topic. And were organizing a proposal now to particularly on the heels of this judgment to identify and disseminate practices around diversifying the medical student body. So many areas in which the American Medical Association is active in this space. But I would just take one step back. This is a space where I believe everybody is humbled. It is an overwhelming problem and in my view is a problem beyond diversity its a problem about health equity and health. And so as much as we are doing we also recognize and are trying our best to partner with other organizations with universities with health systems with others that see this as urgent of an issue as we do because we think only through collaboration given the complexity of this issue are we going to be able to have the change that we aspire to have as quickly as we all believe that its necessary. So our hopes in this space are ambitious and urgent. But the space itself is quite overwhelming and so were eager to continue this work. Unger Well thank you so much Dr. Desai and Dr. Henderson for your perspective on this important change. I appreciate you joining us today. That wraps up todays episode.

https://publichealth.jhu.edu/center-for-health-equity/2023/what-does-the-end-of-affirmative-action-mean-for-health-equity,  Photo by Tingey Injury Law Firm on Unsplash Following the Supreme Court s 2003 decision upholding raceconscious affirmative action policies former Justice Sandra Day O Connor stated that in 25 years affirmative action will not be necessary. However two decades after her original statement affirmative action policies continue to be necessary. Research shows that racially and ethnically minoritized groups are underrepresented in higher education compared to their white counterparts. Despite this such policies have since been ruled unconstitutional.  The June 29th Supreme Court decision to end affirmative action comes after years of cases in which the court has generally ruled in favor of policies that continue racebased affirmative action in college admissions. Such policies are designed to combat hundreds of years of discriminatory hiring and educational practices that failed to give opportunities to populations experiencing disadvantage due to race or ethnicity. Beginning in 1978 the court famously concluded that colleges universities and employers have a compelling interest in creating a diverse student body. Therefore race was just one of many aspects colleges have considered when admitting students for the past several decades.  In contrast banning affirmative action policies has been shown to harm diversity and representation within college classrooms. For states that have already done so for their public colleges in the past research has presented vast declines in enrollment and graduation rates for minoritized students before and after the bans were enacted. These results reflect in undergraduate and graduate programs like medical school as well as the quality of colleges attended by students. According to the Urban Institute after the passage of Proposition 209 the law that banned affirmative action in California there was a 12 decrease in the enrollment of Black Latinx and other underrepresented populations with the decrease becoming even more stark a 60 reduction when considering University of California Berkeley and University of California Los Angeles alone. This drop in educational achievement was also associated with at least a 5 drop in income for students from marginalized groups. These economic barriers circle back into the vicious cycle of negative social determinants that make it difficult to achieve better health. As our Founder and Director Lisa Cooper told Scientific American economic barriers contribute to a lack of access to healthy foods unsafe living conditions and limited options of space to exercise.  Decades of research have shown an association between educational attainment and health outcomes. It is well documented that educational attainment is an essential factor in social mobility and is a precursor to stable employment financial security and healthcare access. While education was once described as the great equalizer others have also considered it a reproducer of inequality . Individuals from higher socioeconomic backgrounds are better positioned to educational opportunities. Zajacova 2018 argues that policies must ensure that marginalized groups have equal or greater access to similar opportunities to avoid further intensifying such disparities. Even before the recent Supreme Court ruling there were stark differences in educational attainment across racial lines. In 2018 the Center for American Progress reported that in the U.S. white students were nearly twice as likely to hold a bachelor s degree in engineering physical science and other STEM degrees than Black students. The recent Supreme Court ruling to end affirmative action is likely to exacerbate the current trends predicting that we will only see an increase in these disparities in educational attainment.  Along with this comes the confirmation of the continued legality of legacy admissions giving students who are the children of university alumni an advantage in their admission to the given school. While this only permits colleges to consider legacy rather than requires it should the admissions process continue in the same manner with the omission of affirmative action and continuation of legacy admissions practices this bidirectional suppression of access to education for students from disadvantaged backgrounds will create a future ripple effect into our society and employment opportunities particularly in the health professions. In response to the decision President of the American Medical Association Jesse Ehrenfeld states This ruling is bad for health care bad for medicine and undermines the health of our nation. A physician workforce that reflects the diversity of the nation is key to eliminating racial inequities.  The representation of marginalized groups in health care is critical to our understanding of health inequities as well as key to patientphysician relationships and improvement in quality of care and health outcomes. In research roles it is crucial to include researchers and collaborators that represent the groups studied and to prioritize finding solutions and interventions that promote health equity. Should these admissions trends continue the 5.7 of physicians that identify as Black will decline the 9.6 of epidemiologists that are Hispanic or Latinx will wane and the 8.5 of nurses that identify as Asian American or Pacific Islander will lessen in a time that direly requires an increase in diversity of health professionals to meet the needs of our increasingly diverse nation.  To ensure diversity in public college and university classes that are more representative of the population at large postsecondary institutions around the country will need to rethink other aspects of admissions that overlook communities marginalized due to race ethnicity income or geography to create a more holistic process. Amidst all of the recent changes in legislation postsecondary researchers educators and scholars give us hope through their proposed solutions to create a more equitable future of access to education. Some of these solutions include investing more resources into recruitment and outreach in more diverse areas and high schools tuitionfree programs and initiatives that automatically admit the top 10 of a high school class to a local college and the deemphasis of standardized test scores or even making applications testoptional.  As Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson said in her dissent on the ruling Our country has never been colorblind. Racially and ethnically tied disparities are present in every aspect of health and wellness in the United States. Education is one piece of the puzzle but a critical one in which we must continue to uplift diverse voices and experiences. Like our approach to advancing health equity the change to college admissions practices requires a shift in perspective. One where we take the opportunity to listen to the stories of Americans of diverse racial ethnic and social class backgrounds and learn about the barriers they face in order to adequately address them all in the name of empowering people to live a better healthier life.

https://www.brouse.com/compliance-checkup-affirmative-action-is-your-health-care-entity-subject-to-affirmative-action-laws-, Have you ever seen a section in a contract that reads something like this?  Your company shall abide by the equal employment opportunity and affirmative action requirements set forth in 41 C.F.R. Part 601.4a 41 C.F.R. Part 60250.5a and Part 60300.5a and 41 C.F.R. Part 60741.5a.  Watch out for this language! Your practice or facility may not be subject to affirmative action laws so read on to understand whether you should accept this provision in an agreement or not. The basics All contractors and subcontractors of the federal government must comply with legal requirements regarding affirmative action and nondiscrimination. A health care entity becomes a federal contractor when it performs services that are used by the federal government either through a direct contract with a federal government agency or an indirect arrangement with another entity that has a federal contract.  How do I know if my health care entity falls under the jurisdiction of OFCCP?In the past the U.S. Department of Labor s Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs OFCCP has aggressively argued that health care providers that participate in one of three federal health care programs Medicare TRICARE and the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program are federal subcontractors. There s little concrete guidance on this complex issue but here s what we do know about common areas of concern  The provider agreements pursuant to which hospitals and other health care providers receive reimbursement for services covered under Medicare Parts A and B and the provider agreements that hospitals and other health care facilities have entered into with State Medicaid agencies are not covered Government contracts under the laws enforced by OFCCP. Accordingly a hospital or other health care provider is not covered under the laws enforced by OFCCP if its only relationship with the Federal government is as a participating provider under Medicare Parts A and B and Medicaid. Please note that a hospital or other health care provider may be a covered contractor because of other contractual arrangements such as providing health care to active or retired military under a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense. Likewise a teaching hospital doing research for a university that has a contract with the Federal government may be covered.  What if my health care entity does fall under the jurisdiction of OFCCP? If your entity is a federal contractor or subcontractor you must be sure to maintain affirmative action program compliance. Compliance also includes but is not limited to writing and maintaining an affirmative action program requiring equal employment opportunity in employment processes and including an equal opportunity clause in all job advertisements and contracts. For additional qualifications and requirements please visit the U.S. Department of Labor Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs website at httpswww.dol.govofccp and ask your attorney to ensure your health care entity is in compliance.  If your entity is not subject to affirmative action requirements make sure you don t inadvertently agree to comply in any contract you may have with a federal contractor. If you have any doubts about your entity s status be sure to ask your Brouse attorney for assistance in evaluating whether you need to comply with affirmative action requirements.

https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2023-07-06/how-health-care-may-be-affected-by-the-supreme-courts-affirmative-action-ruling,  Health News Florida How health care may be affected by the Supreme Court s affirmative action ruling Health News Florida By Michelle Andrews KFF Health News Published July 6 2023 at 746 AM EDT Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Jose Luis Magana APDemonstrators protest outside of the Supreme Court in Washington Thursday June 29 2023 after the Supreme Court struck down affirmative action in college admissions saying race cannot be a factor. Some medical professionals are concerned the decision could have implications for the diversity of medical students the practice of medicine and patient care. Doctors are concerned that a Supreme Court ruling issued June 29 will have farreaching effects not only on the diversity of doctors and other care providers in training but ultimately also on patient care. The decision found it is unconstitutional for colleges and universities to use race as a factor in student admissions which will affect enrollment decisions at public and private educational institutions including medical schools. Like other academic institutions medical schools have long factored race into admission decisions. The schools operated under the principle and there is considerable evidence they are correct that a more diverse workforce of doctors does a better job of treating diverse patients. UNEQUAL SHOTSHow distribution of COVID vaccine exposes inequities in Florida s health care system. The decision demonstrates a lack of understanding of the critical benefits of racial and ethnic diversity in educational settings and a failure to recognize the urgent need to address health inequities read a statement from David Skorton president and CEO of the Association of American Medical Colleges and Frank Trinity its chief legal officer. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the majority opinion. It held that the admissions programs of defendants Harvard College and the University of North Carolina violate the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment which prohibits racial discrimination. The decision overturned decades of legal precedent that had allowed colleges and universities to evaluate prospective students by their race in addition to factors such as academic records and test scores. In a dissent Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote on behalf of the court s three liberal justices that the ruling cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter.  The decision may have serious repercussions medical educators say. The AAMC which represents more than 500 medical schools and teaching hospitals filed an amicus brief with the court arguing that diversity in medical education literally saves lives by ensuring that doctors nurses and other medical professionals can competently care for an increasingly diverse population.  Diversity in health care providers contributes to increased student trainee and physician confidence in working with patient populations who are different from their own identities said Norma PollHunter senior director of workforce diversity at the AAMC. Although it s impossible to predict the full impact of the court s ruling looking to some of the nine states that already have bans on raceconscious college admissions may provide clues. An analysis of bans in six states found that medical school enrollment of students of color who were members of underrepresented groups fell roughly 17 after the bans were instituted. Despite the United States having one of the world s most advanced systems of medical research and clinical care Black people and some other minorities often fare worse than white people across a range of health measures. Their life expectancies are shorter 65.2 years for American Indian and Alaska Native people and 70.8 for Blacks in 2021 versus 76.4 for whites according to KFF. Black and AIAN infants were roughly twice as likely to die as white infants and women in those minority groups had the highest rates of mortality related to pregnancy in 2021. Research shows people of all races tend to prefer to see physicians who are similar to them in race or ethnicity according to PollHunter. When patients are of the same race as their provider they report higher levels of satisfaction and trust and better communication. When patients are of the same race or gender as their provider they may also have better health outcomes research shows. For example in a study of 1.8 million infants born in Florida hospitals between 1992 and 2015 Black newborns were half as likely to die when cared for by Black physicians as when their doctors were white. Research has historically focused on white newborns with white doctors said the study s lead author Brad Greenwood a professor of information systems and operations management at George Mason University.  To the extent that physicians of a social outgroup are more likely to be aware of the challenges and issues that arise when treating their group it stands to reason that these physicians may be more equipped to treat patients with complex needs according to the study. However the solution is not to try to ensure all Black patients are seen by Black physicians Greenwood said.  Jim Crowing medicine is not going to solve this he said referring to laws enacted in the 19th and 20th centuries that enforced racial segregation. Ensuring a diverse physician base can improve care for all patients including those from marginalized groups. As you increase diversity the diversity of opinion increases the scope of how people think about things and express best practices he said. Do No Harm a group of medical and policy professionals who oppose raceconscious medical school admissions and other policies that incorporate identitybased considerations into health care decisionmaking says raceconscious admission is about discrimination not diversity.  Our view is that whoever gets into health care should be the most qualified said Stanley Goldfarb who chairs the board of Do No Harm. It doesn t matter the gender or the race. The only thing that matters is that they re good ethical people and good at what they do.  Goldfarb cited studies that showed no relationship between race or ethnicity concordance and the quality of communication and inconclusive evidence for patient outcomes. The first med school class that will be affected will be the class of 2028. Some experts have suggested that colleges and medical schools may adopt policies that take income or family wealth into account when determining whom to admit. After California banned raceconscious admissions in 1996 the medical school at the University of CaliforniaDavis upended its process to put less emphasis on MCAT scores and grades and more on socioeconomic measures according to Stat. PollHunter with the AAMC isn t convinced. There s no substitute or proxy for race she said. The reality is that in the United States we have a history of exclusion displacement and colonization such that we can t ignore the reality of race.
