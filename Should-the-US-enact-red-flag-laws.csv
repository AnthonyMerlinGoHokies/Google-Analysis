https://www.crapo.senate.gov/news/in-the-news/weekly-column-we-must-be-careful-about-red-flag-laws, Congress recently passed and the President signed into law S. 2938 the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Although this law contained some needed solutions to address mental illness threat identification and school safety I voted against this bill because it will abridge the rights of lawabiding citizens through the use of federal funds to help states establish gun banconfiscation programs also known as red flag laws.  Congress should not incentivize states to establish red flag programs in violation of Americans Second Amendment rights. As demonstrated in some states with red flag laws states can use red flag laws to deny access to firearms without requiring adjudication in a court of law that a person is an imminent danger to self or others. An individual does not need a criminal record or a history of mental illness to lose their firearms. And there is not a mandated requirement that a court must adjudicate the decision to deprive an individual of their constitutional rights.  These types of problems have also surfaced at the federal level. For example the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs VA follows a practice of reporting veterans to the National Instant Criminal Background System NICS thereby prohibiting the veteran from possessing a firearm with the threat of fines and imprisonment if in the opinion of the VA the veteran needs a legal representative to assist them with their benefit payments. These determinations are based on the agency s process and not a court or other lawful authority determining the veteran is a danger. I cosponsored legislation to prohibit this practice at the VA to reinforce the constitutional rights of the veterans who defended them.  During the Obama Administration the Social Security Administration SSA also sought via regulation to declare Americans who need assistance managing their benefits as mentally defective and subject to having their Second Amendment rights revoked. In 2015 I led a letter to the SSA outlining concerns with the proposed rule. Entering millions of seniors into a system designed to prevent the sale of guns to bad actors is not the solution to stopping violence in society. Fortunately in 2017 Congress passed and President Trump signed a resolution that nullified the regulation. I was an original cosponsor of the Senate version of the resolution.  The Idaho Legislature pushed back on federal overreach through red flag laws and other regulatory efforts by passing the Idaho Firearm and Firearm Accessories and Components Protection Act in 2021. This law prevents all Idaho government entities from enforcing executive orders federal laws treaties agency orders and rules of the U.S. government involving firearms firearm components and accessories or ammunition that conflict with the Idaho Constitution.  As Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee I have been working with Committee members on policies to improve our mental health system. Our effort includes seeking meaningful solutions to address violence related to mental health concerns. These policies which expand access to essential care by supporting telehealth options and creating more sites of service are the types of bipartisan targeted solutions that address root causes of gun violence. Several parts of our work were incorporated into S. 2938. I will continue to work to advance these types of sensible solutions that address root causes of gun violence without abridging Second Amendment rights.

Extreme Risk Protection Orders The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act incentivized states to implement extreme risk protection orders and provide information about them to the public. A new study focuses on what messages are likely to work best. A sweeping study released this week found that public knowledge of Extreme Risk Protection Order laws and public attitudes toward their implementation is crucial to how effective and expansive they are. Sometimes referred to as red flag laws ERPOs work to prevent gun tragedies by allowing law enforcement family members or friends to petition courts for a civil order to temporarily separate people in crisis from access to firearms.  Forms of the law have been enacted in 21 states and Washington D.C. many of them in reaction to the Parkland mass shooting in 2018.  Commissioned by the Joyce Foundation the study was undertaken by the Ad Council Research Institute and published in conjunction with the institute s public messaging campaign begun in August 2018 on safe storage. Among its findings is that more effective communication about how these laws work can help keep communities safe from gun violence. The Joyce Foundation provides funding to The Trace.  A forthcoming toolkit related to the study will provide guidance on public awareness messaging and implementation including how to identify a trusted source and how to best frame educational messaging around the laws. This toolkit and research set up organizations with knowing what we know bypassing some of the challenges and focusing on opportunities where there is common ground said Derrick Feldmann the lead researcher on the study and managing director of the Ad Council Research Institute. One of the most comprehensive of its kind the study surveyed more than 10000 respondents from 19 states that currently have laws for extreme risk protection orders in addition to Washington D.C. The research comes at a time when ERPO Programs are being developed and implemented nationwide following the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act which incentivized states by including provisions for mental health school safety and the process of obtaining or accessing a firearm. The Biden administration followed up on these reforms by directing the federal government to increase public awareness of such programs and their uses nationwide. The study was made up of a racially educationally economically and politically diverse pool including gun owners nongunowners law enforcement and veterans. It found that 65 percent of respondents were aware of protection orders but only 7 percent considered themselves very familiar with the laws.  Along with statespecific information the authors suggest that two frames work best to inform and motivate the public about ERPOs success stories or personal anecdotes from people who used the law successfully and what the study referred to as lethal combination a frame which places an emphasis on the laws design to prevent negative action by a person at risk and who has access to a firearm rather than being a punishment.  Respondents in the study wanted clear and precise information on what evidence is needed for a successful ERPO petition and individuals who are close to someone in crisis at risk of harming themselves or others wanted more information on the laws as well as crisis resources generally. By contrast the study noted that people who didn t know someone in crisis were less likely to find relevance in the messaging though the majority of all respondents found the message frames somewhat relevant.  With more detail about the ERPO process respondents concerns about the law s temporary nature how it is used by law enforcement and how the legal system applies it increased. While fewer than half of all respondents believed the laws would be fairly enforced or trusted the legal system to apply it correctly there was more concern among Black and Hispanic participants as well as those in Gen Z and millennial generations about law enforcement s discretion to enforce them. There was slightly lower awareness of the laws among Black and Gen Z respondents. As in the ACRI study factors like political affiliation race and gender all have been found to play a role in Americans attitudes toward gun policy and their storage practices. But among these respondents the general population often agreed 75 percent had positive feelings towards red flag laws once detailed information was shared about the laws ability to prevent suicides and mass shootings through the removal of firearms. Studies led by the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health found that ERPOs have been used to prevent threats of suicide and other acts of violence like mass shootings and studies that have analyzed ERPO laws in California found that these orders prevented 21 mass shootings from taking place between 2016 through 2018. The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors recently began a public outreach campaign to increase public knowledge about using gun violence restraining orders because although there is a law in place it is rarely used. Feldmann the researcher said the toolkit provides a starting point for organizations to reexamine their existing work on these laws to create momentum around the communication work they are doing and try to avoid some of the pitfalls that could come up in the process.

Keeping students safe from gun violence in their school communities is a top priority for the BidenHarris Administration. According to the Washington Post there have been 394 school shootings that exposed more than 360000 students to gun violence since the mass shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado in 1999. The BidenHarris Administration is committed to preventing gun violence. President Biden and Vice President Harris worked to enact the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act BSCA the most significant gun safety law in nearly 30 years. Following this the President created the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention which is being overseen by Vice President Harris. The unprecedented Office is accelerating the implementation of BSCA identifying new executive actions partnering with state and local officials and coordinating the first ever federal interagency response to mass shootings and concentrations of community violence. The President has also taken more executive actions on preventing gun violence than any other President. The BidenAdministration has invested more resources in school safety and taken significant steps to keeps firearms out of school. The strategy has focused on 1 stopping people in crisis and juveniles from accessing firearms 2 implementing evidencebased schoolbased preventative solutions and 3 addressing the mental health needs of students particularly those impacted by gun violence. During her visit to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida the Vice President is announcing two solutions to keep guns out of the hands of people in crisis First Vice President Harris is announcing the launch of the firstever National Extreme Risk Protection Order ERPO Resource Center which will support the effective implementation of state red flag laws. Second the Vice President is calling on states to pass red flag laws and to use BSCA funding to help implement laws already enacted. Extreme Risk Protection Order or Red Flag Laws Can Prevent Shootings The Department of Homeland Security s National Threat Assessment Center conducted a systematic review of targeted school violence incidents and found that there were often warning signs. The review which is corroborated by other analysis found that these incidents were often preceded by observed warning signs including instances where the individual told other about their plan ahead of time. ERPO or red flag laws generally create a civil process for law enforcement and often times family members to seek a judicial order that a person is a danger to themselves or others and should temporarily lose the ability to purchase and possess firearms. The laws have due process protections that ensure people s rights are respected but also enable a concrete way to intervene. The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School occurred after there were clear warning signs but there were no tools to remove the shooter s firearm. The survivors of the shooting advocated for passage of a red flag law in Florida and the tragedy helped to inspire the passage of red flag laws in other states across the country. Currently 21 states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws on the books. These laws have been shown to prevent mass shootings and suicides but the tools made available under these laws are only effective if people are aware of them and can properly invoke them. Additional BidenHarris Administration Actions to Keep Schools Safe Addressing Access to Firearms by People in Crisis or Under 21 The National Threat Assessment Center found that 76 percent of incidents of targeted school shootings are committed with guns from the home. There are approximately 4.6 million children living in homes with unsecured firearms so the BidenHarris Administration has prioritized raising awareness about how safe gun storage can keep schools and young people safe. For example U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona sent a letter and template to school principals across the country explaining the importance of safe storage and encouraging them to communicate with parents families caregivers and the broader community about how safe storage can protect students in school and in their communities. The DOJ released a comprehensive guide to safe storage of firearms in order to provide subject matter expertise on different types of storage devices and best practices for safely storing firearms. This is the most comprehensive guide on safe storage ever released by the federal government. In addition DOJ s Byrne State Crisis Intervention Program made grant funds available for law enforcement to acquire gun locks and storage devices that can be distributed to individuals and businesses. The BidenHarris Administration has quickly implemented BSCA to enhance background check for individuals under 21 who seek to purchase a firearm at a licensed gun dealer. Federal law has longprohibited firearms dealers from selling handguns to persons under 21 . The BSCA requires enhanced background checks before any sale or transfer of a firearm to a person under the age of 21. Since implementing BSCA s enhanced background checks in October 2022 DOJ has conducted enhanced background checks on more than 230000 transactions. Those checks have kept more than 2300 firearms out of the hands of dangerous and prohibited persons and over a quarter of those denials 667 as of this month were based solely on information received through the additional BSCAenabled outreach. Just a few of the transactions denied under the new background check illustrate how important this new tool is working Lastly untraceable ghost guns that could be ordered online and easily completed at home were starting to show up in school shootings. The BidenHarris Administration cracked down on ghost guns by making clear that businesses manufacturing the most accessible ghost guns including buybuildshoot kits must comply with federal firearm laws requiring background checks a federal license and inclusion of serial numbers. Largest Dedicated Effort on EvidenceBased SchoolBased Solutions The BidenHarris Administration provided 1 billion to schools through the Stronger Connections Grant program which helps provide students with safe and supportive learning opportunities and environments that are critical for their success and overall wellbeing. Stronger Connections funding is allocated to underserved school districts including those that have a high rate of community or school violence on a competitive basis and may be used for a variety of strategies including schoolbased mental health services safety and violence prevention and intervention programs and physical security measures.  Over the past 3 years the BidenHarris Administration has awarded nearly 500 million for schools to invest in evidencebased solutions through the STOP School Violence Program with funding supplemented by BSCA. The program is designed to improve K12 school security by providing schools students and teachers with the tools they need to recognize respond quickly to and help prevent acts of violence and ensure a positive school climate. This includes developing and operating anonymous reporting systems and training school personnel on preventing school violence. The DOJ anticipates approximately 160 million in additional funding opportunities for the STOP program this year. The Biden Harris Administration has established the Federal School Safety Clearinghouse pursuant to the Luke and Alex School Safety Act that was part of BSCA. The Clearinghouse located at SchoolSafety.gov provides evidencebased practices and recommendations to improve school safety for use by states local educational agencies institutions of higher education state and local law enforcement agencies health professionals and the general public. Historic Investment in Student Mental Health The BidenHarris Administration awarded 122 billion in American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief funds to help schools reopen and recover and experts indicate more than 2 billion has been directed to hire more school psychologists counselors and other mental health professionals in K12 schools. With the help of these funds the number of school social workers school counselors school nurses and school psychologists have all increased over prepandemic levels. The BidenHarris Administration will invest more than 1 billion to help underserved school districts hire and train schoolbased mental health professionals over the next five years. To date the U.S. Department of Education ED has awarded 571 million across 264 grantees in 48 states and the District of Columbia to boost the training hiring and diversity of mental health professionals in schools. The funding was made available through BSCA and grantees estimate that these funds will collectively support the training and hiring of more than 14000 new mental health professionals to serve America s school children. ED anticipates making approximately 38 million of new funding available for new applicants his year. The BidenHarris Administration will continue to take action to ensure that our schools and our communities are safe from gun violence. At the same time President Biden and Vice President Harris call on Congress to pass universal background checks a national red flag law an assault weapons ban and a secure storage law to repeal the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act PLCAA which gives gun dealers and manufactures special immunity from certain liability for their products and to increase appropriations to support youth mental health and violence prevention strategies.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/23/red-flag-laws-gun-control, The vicepresident announced the creation of a national office to help implement the laws in the states that have them On the books in less than half of US states red flag laws vary from place to place but generally require that people who are deemed a threat to themselves or others turn over their guns for a certain period of time. While research shows they lead to significant drops in firearm suicides and may also have prevented dozens of mass shootings the concept is frequently rebuffed by Republican politicians who say they infringe on due process rights. On Saturday the vicepresident Kamala Harris announced that the White House has created a new national office to help states implement red flag laws an initiative funded by the justice department. The announcement comes after Joe Biden s establishment in September of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention which Harris is leading. In announcing the office Harris called on the states without red flag laws to enact them citing their ability to prevent mass shootings. Here s a look at how red flag laws actually work their potential to prevent gun violence and the right s efforts to undo them. A red flag law refers to a civil proceeding that allows people usually police officers and family members to petition a judge for an emergency order that would temporarily remove firearms from a person found to be at risk of harming themselves or someone else. Depending on the state these are also called extreme risk protection orders Erpos extreme risk laws or gun violence restraining orders. Though names vary they broadly operate in the same ways and are modeled after domestic violence restraining orders DVROs that are meant to protect victims of household or intimate partner violence. The first Erpo law was established in Connecticut in 1999 one year after a 35yearold accountant at the state lottery killed four of his bosses before turning his firearm on himself. The second law was put in place five years later in Indiana. Since the mid to late 2010s following several highprofile mass shootings on school campuses and other public spaces the number of states with some type of red flag law grew mainly across blue states like Oregon New York Connecticut and Minnesota but also in Florida and Nevada. In all 21 states where Erpos exist law enforcement is eligible to petition a judge for an order and in some states such as New Mexico and Florida they re the only ones eligible to do so. In other states such as California Colorado and Hawaii eligible petitioners include family members teachers and medical professionals. Though routinely invoked by news media officials and commentators in the wake of a highprofile mass shooting Erpos are also used as suicideprevention tools. Upon learning that someone is threatening to harm themselves or another person and they know or believe that person has access to a firearm a petition can be submitted to a judge. The judge will evaluate whether the situation warrants an immediate order based on the specificity of the threats and access to a firearm. If the judge finds that the risk of violence is high they can issue an emergency ex parte order which will go into immediate effect without the subject of the order being present or notified in advance. In this case the subject of the petition can request their guns back from law enforcement which then conducts a background check before returning the firearms. The emergency order requires an immediate surrender of firearms for two weeks until an evidentiary hearing is held during which the subject can present evidence that they are not a threat. The judge can uphold the order in which case the person s guns continue to be withheld usually for a year and then returned. If the judge accepts the subject s defense they can get their guns back immediately. Due process is established by the 14th amendment of the US constitution and guarantees that someone whose constitutional rights will be affected has a right to be notified and able to participate in legal proceedings. In the context of gun seizures based on extreme and immediate risk this right is weighed against public and private interest which in the case of Erpos is the physical safety of the gun owner and the community. Erpos aren t the only arena in which someone can be subject to a court action before they have their day in court. A similar process is used with restraining orders in which someone is barred from being in the same space as another person under threat of arrest and jail time. And while the initial emergency ruling to take someone s guns happens without a hearing a longterm order isn t put into place until a hearing is held. Usually it is set for one to three weeks after the ex parte order. During these hearings people have the opportunity to appear before a judge to present evidence that refutes the original petition. They can hire representation or speak for themselves but people subject to these orders are not offered a public defender since Erpos are civil not criminal matters. While there is no centralized data on the use of Erpos statelevel research suggests these laws have an impact on suicide and massshooting prevention. According to research on extreme risk laws in Indiana and Connecticut two of the first states to establish Erpo laws these orders were credited with 13 and 7 decreases in firearm suicides between 1981 and 2015 respectively. In California which established its gun violence restraining order law in 2016 the orders were used 58 times when mass shootings were threatened. Six of these cases involved minors who had planned to target schools according to the violence prevention research center at the University of California Davis. It s difficult to get a picture of the universal effectiveness of Erpos because most of the state statutes are less than a decade old and can take years to implement through education among the public and law enforcement. Experts say that Erpos are only as effective as their implementation which requires education campaigns to let people know these laws exist and how to file for an order. This effort has to reach all of the systems and individuals involved in the process. This includes judges administrative staff law enforcement officers and advocates who walk petitioners through the Erpo process. In February 2023 the US Department of Justice doled out 231m to support states Erpo and other crisis response programs. Since 2010 1200 US counties across 42 states have declared themselves second amendment sanctuaries where law enforcement won t adhere to any gun policy that it believes violates the second amendment. As red flag laws expand throughout the country starting in the late 2010s questions about their constitutionality have consistently come up from gun rights advocates and rightleaning officials. These debates have only grown since the US supreme court s 2022 ruling in the New York State Rifle Pistol Association v Bruen case which established a new standard to determine the constitutionality of a gun law based on whether it s consistent with the nation s historical tradition .However the United States v Rahimi case may put the future of red flag laws at stake. The case centers on whether the second amendment rights of Zackey Rahimi who was subject to a domestic violence restraining order for assaulting his then girlfriend were violated. The future of DVROs and Erpos can be thrown into question if the supreme court rules that they are not in line with the historical test created by the Bruen decision.
https://journalistsresource.org/criminal-justice/mass-shootings-red-flag-laws-update/, There is research suggesting red flag laws are effective in preventing suicides along with a small but growing body of research on red flag laws and mass shootings.

Five people were killed and 18 were injured on Nov. 19 when a shooter began firing in Club Q an LGBTQ club in Colorado Springs before patrons stopped the attacker. Colorado is one of 19 states along with the District of Columbia that have extreme risk protection order or red flag laws. These laws allow courts through due process to temporarily take firearms from people whom family friends police officers or others report as potentially dangerous to themselves or others. Colorado s red flag law went into effect on Jan. 1 2020. A police officer relative or roommate in the state can initiate the process of temporarily removing someone s firearms if that person threatens violence.  In 2021 the person accused of the Club Q attack was arrested on felony menacing and kidnapping charges in El Paso County. Those charges were dropped.  We re certainly going to take a hard look at why the red flag law wasn t used in this case Gov. Jared Polis told Meet the Press on Nov. 27 referring to the Club Q shooting. Polis has also said he wants to see Colorado s red flag law expanded so district attorneys and others can use it. This is not the first time red flag laws have entered the national conversation. Researchers raised red flag laws as one piece of the puzzle toward reducing gun violence following a mass shooting in May at a grocery store in Buffalo New York. Other massacres have brought the laws national media attention including a Nov. 13 shooting that left three University of Virginia football players dead and a shooting at a Walmart in Chesapeake Virginia that killed 6 people on Nov. 22. Virginia joined Colorado in 2020 as the states that have most recently passed red flag laws. Colorado Springs is in El Paso County which has one of the lowest countylevel red flag order approval rates in the state according to an investigation from Denverbased NBC News affiliate KUSATV. In 2019 in anticipation of Polis signing the state red flag law local officials declared El Paso County a Second Amendment sanctuary making it one of 37 Colorado counties out of 64 total counties that passed resolutions saying they would not enforce the law. A county sheriff who refused to enforce a red flag order could be held in contempt of court according to the KUSATV investigation. Research indicates the sanctuary resolutions may have had a chilling effect on red flag orders being filed. In 2020 the first full year the Colorado law went into effect there were 109 extreme risk protection order petitions filed statewide according to a paper Colorado s First Year of Extreme Risk Protection Orders published in October 2021 in the journal Injury Epidemiology. That works out to about 1.5 extreme risk protection orders filed per 100000 people in sanctuary counties compared with 2 orders filed per 100000 people in nonsanctuary counties according to the research. A flood of states passed red flag laws after a former student shot and killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida in February 2018. In August 2019 after shooters in separate incidents killed a combined 31 people in Dayton Ohio and El Paso Texas thenPresident Donald Trump reiterated his call for states to pass red flag laws. Federal gun safety legislation President Joe Biden signed in June 2022 after the school shooting in Uvalde Texas that killed 19 children and two adults includes 750 million for states to run red flag and other intervention programs. There is a lack of federally funded national research on gun violence because Congress in 1996 passed legislation prohibiting the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using funds to advocate or promote gun control.  As Drs. Arthur Kellermann and Frederick Rivara explain in a 2013 Journal of the American Medical Association retrospective essay on government efforts to curtail gun violence research Precisely what was or was not permitted under the clause was unclear. But no federal employee was willing to risk his or her career or the agency s funding to find out.  While there is not an overwhelming amount of research on whether red flag laws can prevent mass shootings there are some recent papers on the topic. An October 2022 paper Extreme risk protection orders in response to threats of multiple victimmass shooting in six U.S. states in the journal Preventive Medicine provides an overview of how often extreme risk protection orders stem from a threat involving multiple victims. In California Colorado Connecticut Florida Maryland and Washington 10 of 6787 red flag cases through June 2020 were filed in response to a threat against at least 3 people the authors find. The start date varied depending on when a state s red flag law went into effect. Connecticut had the earliest start date Jan. 1 2013. Among threats made against at least 3 people intimate partners along with their friends or family were threatened in 15 of those cases while 20 of threats were made toward K12 schools.  Even if only a small percentage of these cases would have been acted upon their prevention would have a consequential impact resulting in lives saved the authors write. In other recent research on whether red flag laws counter mass shootings Extreme Risk Protection Orders Intended to Prevent Mass Shootings published in November 2019 in the Annals of Internal Medicine the authors review 159 red flag law cases in California. They identify 21 cases in which a judicial officer issued a firearm restraining order after a person who would soon have access to guns declared or indicated they were going to commit a mass shooting. The authors caution against drawing a causal relationship between red flag laws and preventing mass shootings but they conclude that the cases suggest that this urgent individualized intervention can play a role in efforts to prevent mass shootings in health care settings and elsewhere.  And an April 2019 paper Are the Deadliest Mass Shootings Preventable? in the Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice finds that among the 15 deadliest mass shootings in the U.S. from March 1998 to February 2018 the attackers hinted at violence before committing the acts.  Even in the unusual cases where the offenders violent intentions were apparently unknown the DC Navy Yard and Las Vegas shootings the individuals had admitted struggling with mental health problems and shown other reasons for concern the authors write. If you know of other recent research on red flag laws and mass shootings let us know. Research is more extensive on the association between red flag laws and lower suicide rates. One study published in Psychiatric Services in 2018 looks at how red flag laws affected suicide rates in Connecticut and Indiana. Nationally more than half of gun deaths are suicides according to 2020 data from the CDC. Connecticut passed the nation s first red flag law in 1999. But the law wasn t strongly enforced until after the mass shooting at Virginia Tech in April 2007 according to the Psychiatric Services paper s authors Aaron Kivisto and Peter Phalen of the University of Indianapolis. Indiana s law was enforced immediately after the state legislature passed it in 2005 according to the authors. Kivisto and Phalen find that Indiana s law was associated with a 7.5 drop in firearm suicides in the decade after its passage. Connecticut s law they find was associated with a 1.6 reduction in firearm suicides after it was passed that jumped to 13.7 after the state started enforcing the law in earnest eight years later.  Even though riskbased firearm seizure laws have typically been enacted in response to mass homicides the laws have functioned primarily as a means of seizing firearms from suicidal individuals Kivisto and Phalen write. Other research led by Jeffrey Swanson at Duke University also analyzes how the Connecticut and Indiana laws have affected suicides. Swanson s research takes a slightly different approach from Kivisto and Phalen. It looks at the prevention of suicide by firearm as a function of gun seizures. In both Connecticut and Indiana Swanson and colleagues find roughly one suicide is prevented for every 10 gun seizures. While research has found that these laws can save lives Swanson writes that other questions still need answers. For example How do these laws work best? Are there potential adverse consequences? How big of an impact can red flag laws have?  These questions form an agenda for the next generation of research studies an important next step in bringing this lifesaving legal policy to scale Swanson concludes. And there are now millions of federal dollars to fund research on selfharm and other types of gun violence. In December 2019 Congress allocated 12.5 million apiece to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to study gun violence in fiscal year 2020. Congress made the same allocation for 2021. Funded research is under way including a 2 million study that began in September 2021 exploring which safety strategies deter school shootings slated to end in August 2024. The FBI defines a mass shooting as one in which four or more people are killed by an attacker firing a gun though there is no standard definition for mass shootings. Tallies of mass shootings from the nonprofit Gun Violence Archive are often covered in the news media. That group defines a mass shooting as at least four people killed or injured not including the shooter. In the U.S. there have been more than 615 mass shootings in the first 11 months of 2022 according to the Gun Violence Archive. While mass shootings receive wide media attention they represent a small percentage of gun deaths. Writing in the Journal of Crime and Justice Jaclyn Shildkraut at the State University of New York at Oswego along with Jaymi Elsass and Kimberly Meredith from Texas State University find that raceethnicity and victim counts are the most salient predictor of whether or not a shooting was covered.  After Parkland an interdisciplinary group of 19 experts released an 8point proposal for preventing gun violence at schools writing that prevention entails more than security measures and begins long before a gunman comes to school.  Regulations such as universal background checks removing guns from people with a history of violence and red flag laws are most strongly associated with reducing firearm homicides according to a Rockefeller Institute of Government policy brief from March 2019 by Michael Siegel and Claire Boine both of Boston University. Politicians sometimes bring up mental illness after mass shootings. In an analysis of 160 mass public shootings across the country during the 1990s Grant Duwe director of research at the Minnesota Department of Corrections found in 60 of cases studied the killers had a psychiatric diagnosis. Another study that analyzed 305 violent incidents committed by people with a history of violence found psychosis immediately preceded 12 of those incidents. Duwe and others urge against stigmatizing people with mental illness.  Although these statistics should not be used to stigmatize populations they do provide some justification for increased mental health treatment access and screening which is sorely lacking in the United States Duwe writes in a separate paper in Current Opinion in Psychology from February 2018. People with mental illness are much more likely to be victims than perpetrators of violence according to a wide body of research including a 2017 paper in the Annual Review of Clinical Psychology that found guns are not by and large a mental health problem. Other research has estimated that to prevent one random homicide by a person diagnosed with schizophrenia 35000 people with schizophrenia would need successful risk management treatment. Megan Ranney from Brown University and Jessica Gold from Washington University in St. Louis have noted that mass shootings are more correlated with domestic violence than mental illness. If we are going to talk about the role of mental health in mass shootings let s talk instead about mental health in the aftermath they write in a piece published Aug. 7 2019 in Time.  While research is sparse when it comes to red flag laws and mass shootings research does show that these laws can still save lives. The evidence on suicide prevention is a good enough reason for states to enact extreme risk protection order laws and for the federal government to incentivize them with infrastructure grants Swanson writes in an Aug. 9 2019 article in The Washington Post. Team owners looking to build or revamp big league sports stadiums often seek public funds in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But research conducted over decades indicates these investments almost never lead to massive economic gains for host cities. A big reason voter registration rates vary so much in the U.S. is because states have their own election policies and processes which can make registering easy or difficult. Election offices also differ in how they educate voters. People incarcerated for felony convictions lose the right to vote across most of the U.S. but specifics vary widely by state.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/what-are-red-flag-laws-do-they-work-prevent-gun-violence/,  By Aliza Chasan   June 30 2023 600 AM EDT CBS News  Until 2018 just five states had adopted red flag laws. The number of states implementing such laws surged after the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida.  The nonprofit group Everytown for Gun Safety has been a big advocate for these laws. Theyre vital to preventing gun violence said Chelsea Parsons Everytowns director of implementation. They provide a proactive opportunity to prevent tragedies she said. You dont have to wait for somebody to commit a crime when there are clear warning signs that this person having access to firearms poses a clear risk. Heres what to know about red flag laws and their impact on gun violence. These laws allow people to petition for the temporary confiscation of an individuals firearms if that person is deemed to be a risk to themself or to others.  Petitioners first ask a judge to issue a confiscation order. They present evidence about the risk they believe the individual poses. The judge decides when to issue an order.  The basic idea behind these laws is that they allow a court to order a firearm to be temporarily taken away from a person who presents an immediate risk to themselves or others said Joseph Blocher codirector of Duke Universitys Center for Firearms Law.  Laws about who can petition vary from state to state. In some states coworkers employers teachers doctors and family and household members can file petitions for gun removal. But Parsons said in most states its still largely law enforcement officers who can petition for the orders sometimes referred to as ERPOs for extreme risk protection orders.  It can be an extremely intimidating process to go to court on your own file a petition like this during a moment of intense crisis Parsons said.  The organization recommends policymakers focus on the needs of petitioners outside of law enforcement to make sure the process is accessible.  Everytown maintains a list of state laws and who is permitted to petition for a firearm to be removed in each state. Critics argue red flag laws go against the Second Amendment. While there have been Second Amendment challenges to these laws theyve each failed Blocher said. In Hope v. State the Connecticut Appellate Court in 2016 concluded that the states firearm removal law does not violate the Second Amendment because it does not restrict the right of lawabiding responsible citizens to use arms in defense of their homes. Normally when youre deprived of some constitutional interest like possession of a gun you are entitled to notice and a hearing and those kinds of things said Blocher. Red flag laws permit these emergency orders to be entered without necessarily a full hearing. So I think people want to know is there enough process here to protect people from being wrongfully deprived of their guns? More than 20 states along with Washington D.C. have passed red flag laws as of June 2023. They are There are two types of orders emergency or ex parte orders and final orders according to the Giffords Law Center a research organization that advocates for more restrictive gun control measures.  The emergency order can be issued without the gun owner present during the court hearing Blocher said. The order is usually short term and lasts a week or two. Another hearing then happens with the gun owner present to make their case.  Based on the judges ruling at the second hearing someones gun can be removed for a longer duration. The final order lasts for a year in most states. At that point it can either expire or be renewed. Gun owners can also request hearings to have their firearms returned. How often they can petition the court depends on the state the individual lives in.  In Colorado where a red flag law was signed in 2019 nearly half of the states counties declared themselves Second Amendment sanctuaries.  The shooter who opened fire with an AR15style rifle inside Colorado Springs Club Q last year killing five people and wounding 17 others had previously been arrested for making threats. The state has a red flag law but no ERPO was filed. In Colorado law enforcement family and household members certain medical professionals and certain educators can file petitions according to Everytown. The sheriff in El Paso County has previously said he would not use the states ERPO law except in exigent circumstances Allison Anderman senior counsel and director of local policy at Giffords Law Center said.  Victims families and survivors of the shooting there have said they plan to sue the sheriffs office for failing to block the shooter from buying guns before the attack. The El Paso County Sheriffs has not responded to repeated CBS requests for comment on the issue but the official policy on the issue is still that deputies will not petition for an ERPO unless exigent circumstances exist and probable cause can be established pursuant to 163301 C.R.S that a crime is being or has been committed. It is the policy of the Sheriffs Office to respect and protect the constitutional rights of all those we serve according to the departments policy posted online. The El Paso County Sheriffs Office will ensure that the rights of people to be free from unreasonable search and seizures and to receive due process of law are safeguarded and maintained. Other states face problems because of a lack of coordination and investment Anderman said. Some feel red flag laws infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear arms. Republican Sen. Mike Crapo who represents Idaho which does not have a red flag law has said hes working on ways to address gun violence without abridging Second Amendment rights. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz also a Republican has said he supports the ability of states to make their own ERPO laws but does not support them federally. Texas does not have a red flag law. Cruz has said red flag laws pushed by Democrats and gun control advocates are designed to deprive Americans of fundamental rights.  Across the U.S. Blocher has found many are concerned about being wrongfully deprived of their guns without trial.  I think theres a misconception that these extreme risk protection orders are a criminal punishment. Theyre not he said. Theyre like a restraining order and those are civil. Theres no federal red flag law but in February the Justice Department announced it would be sending out more than 230 million to help states and the District of Columbia administer red flag laws and other crisisintervention programs. Biden also signed legislation in June 2022 making it easier for states to put red flag laws into place. The bill includes incentives for states to pass red flag laws.  Neither Blocher nor Andrew Willinger executive director of the Duke Center for Firearms Law believe a federal red flag law is likely.  The focus is really on not necessarily moving toward a federal law but improving these laws at the state level Willinger said. Aliza Chasan is a digital producer at 60 Minutes and CBSNews.com.

California s red flag law which allows people to obtain gun violence restraining orders GVROs went into effect seven years ago. Since then GVROs have been credited with deterring at least 58 potential mass shootings and other types of gun violence in California including suicides. Currently 19 states and the District of Columbia have red flag laws also known as extreme risk protection order laws.  Red flag laws are a tool law enforcement and others can use when somebody is clearly at high risk of doing something with a firearm but they cant be arrested because no crime has been committed and they dont appear to need a mental health hold or qualify for one Amy Barnhorst said. Barnhorst is a psychiatrist at UC Davis Health and an expert on violence prevention. She is vice chair of Community Mental Health and the director of the BulletPoints Project which teaches clinicians how to prevent firearm violence. She remembers the days before California s red flag law. When somebody was making threats about hurting people at their school or even threats of suicide there wasnt much that could be done Barnhorst said. Red flag laws have changed that. With the law there is something that can be done about people who are making threats or have concerning behaviors.  Gunrelated deaths remain high in the U.S. The Gun Violence Archive which tracks firearm violence in the U.S. reports 648 mass shootings 20176 homicides and 24090 suicides in 2022.  Research has found that in about 80 of cases people who commit mass shootings or suicide make their intentions known in advance to family members or friends or via social media.  Its really important that if you are concerned about a student in your school or you re a concerned parent teacher employer or somebody whos worried about someone know there is a way to intervene and reduce the risk. But you need to tell someone such as law enforcement who can act Barnhorst said.  If youre in California and there is someone youre concerned about who may be at risk of firearm injury and they have access to guns you can go to the Speak for Safety website. It can help walk you through how to pursue a gun violence restraining order Barnhorst said. The website has different tabs you can select for your relationship to the person at risk such as employer or coworker family or household member law enforcement or teacher or school employee. The California Courts website also has information in English and Spanish about how to obtain a GVRO.   In many cases law enforcement can get an emergency GVRO on the scene and they can remove any firearms from the person at risk at that time Barnhorst said. If the judge determines that the person is at risk the judge can continue the prohibition. The guns will continue to be kept away for the duration of the order which can be renewed after a year or longer in some cases.  Barnhorst explains there is due process during all stages of the legal procedures. People who have had their firearms removed can appear in court to give their side. If the judge determines they are not a danger the prohibition can be lifted and the firearms returned Barnhorst said. She notes GVROs are civil court actions. They dont involve the criminal courts and they dont become part of a persons criminal record. Despite the potential to reduce mass shootings and suicides the use of GVROs in California has been limited. One of the biggest barriers appears to be the lack of awareness about them. A recent survey found that nearly twothirds of the respondents did not know about GVROs although 70 said they would consider using one in a highrisk situation.  The GVRO law empowers people to play a role in preventing firearm violence among friends family members coworkers and classmates by providing a tool to remove firearms from crisis situations said Veronica Pear an assistant professor at the Violence Prevention Research Program at UC Davis. Pear studies violence prevention and has published numerous studies about the efficacy of red flag laws.  However the law can only save lives if it is used and for that reason education is key Pear said.

https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/red-flag-laws-get-little-use-even-as-mass-shootings-gun-deaths-soar, Chicago is one of the nation s gun violence hotspots and a seemingly ideal place to employ Illinois red flag law that allows police to step in and take firearms away from people who threaten to kill. But amid more than 8500 shootings resulting in 1800 deaths since 2020 the law was used there just four times. It s a pattern that s played out in New Mexico with nearly 600 gun homicides during that period and a mere eight uses of its red flag law. And in Massachusetts with nearly 300 shooting homicides and just 12 uses of its law. An Associated Press analysis found many U.S. states barely use the red flag laws touted as the most powerful tool to stop gun violence before it happens a trend blamed on a lack of awareness of the laws and resistance by some authorities to enforce them even as shootings and gun deaths soar. AP found such laws in 19 states and the District of Columbia were used to remove firearms from people 15049 times since 2020 fewer than 10 per 100000 adult residents. Experts called that woefully low and not nearly enough to make a dent in gun violence considering the millions of firearms in circulation and countless potential warning signs law enforcement officers encounter from gun owners every day. READ MORE Mass shootings obscure daily U.S. gun toll  It s too small a pebble to make a ripple Duke University sociologist Jeffrey Swanson who has studied red flag gun surrender orders across the nation said of the AP tally. It s as if the law doesn t exist.   The number of people we are catching with red flags is likely infinitesimal added Indiana University law professor Jody Madeira who like other experts who reviewed AP s findings wouldn t speculate how many red flag removal orders would be necessary to make a difference. The search for solutions comes amid a string of mass shootings in Buffalo New York Uvalde Texas and Highland Park Illinois and a spike in gun violence not seen in decades 27000 deaths so far this year following 45000 deaths each of the past two years. AP s count compiled from inquiries and Freedom of Information Law requests showed wide disparities in how the laws were applied from state to state county to county most without regard to population or crime rates. Florida led with 5800 such orders or 34 per 100000 adult residents but that is due mostly to aggressive enforcement in a few counties that don t include MiamiDade and others with more gun killings. More than a quarter of Illinois slim 154 orders came from one suburban county that makes up just 7 percent of the state s population. California had 3197 orders but was working through a backlog of three times that number of people barred from owning guns under a variety of measures who had not yet surrendered them. And a national movement among politicians and sheriffs that has declared nearly 2000 counties as Second Amendment Sanctuaries opposing laws that infringe on gun rights may have affected red flag enforcement in several states. In Colorado 37 counties that consider themselves sanctuaries issued just 45 surrender orders in the two years through last year a fifth fewer than nonsanctuary counties did per resident. New Mexico and Nevada reported only about 20 orders combined.  The law shouldn t even be there in the first place argued Richard Mack a former Arizona sheriff who heads the progun Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association. You re taking away someone s property and means of selfdefense.  WATCH MORE Suicides from firearms prompt movement to address mental health stigmas Red flag laws most of which came into effect over the last four years allow police officers who believe gun owners are an imminent danger to themselves or others to petition a judge to order firearms surrendered or barring that seized for an emergency period typically two weeks. The judge can then convene a court hearing in which petitioners present evidence to withhold weapons longer typically a year and the owner can argue against that. AP s tally counts an emergency order that is followed by a longer one as a single order if they involve the same gun owner. In rare cases where no one asked for an emergency order and only a longer one was requested and granted that also counts as a single order. Several states reported incomplete data. Some states also allow family members of gun owners school officials work colleagues or doctors to ask for gun removal orders also known as extreme risk protection orders. But data reviewed by the AP show nearly all petitions in several states were initiated by police possibly because as several surveys have shown few people outside law enforcement are even aware the laws exist. The recent spike in shootings has brought renewed attention to red flag laws with states including Alaska Pennsylvania and Kentucky introducing legislation to add them. The Biden administration is seeking to foster wider use of red flag laws by allocating money in a newly passed federal gun law to help spread the word about such measures. An APNORC poll in late July found 78 percent of U.S. adults strongly or somewhat favor red flag laws but the backlash against them has been intense in some states particularly in rural areas. Opponents argue that allowing judges to rule on gun seizures in initial emergency petitions before full hearings violates due process rights though court cases claiming this have generally found the laws constitutional. WATCH Red flag laws questioned after revelations about Highland Park gunman Many police believe seizing guns can also be dangerous and unnecessary even as a last resort especially in sparsely populated areas where they know many of the residents with mental health issues said Tony Mace head of the New Mexico Sheriffs Association which lobbied against the state s law.  You re showing up with 10 to 15 law enforcement officers and coming in the middle of the night and kicking in the door and it s already a dangerous environment said Mace sheriff of Cibola County a sanctuary county with just one order since 2020. You re dealing with someone in crisis and elevating it even more.  One fierce gun rights defender who still aggressively uses the law is Polk County Florida Sheriff Grady Judd who says he doesn t let his beliefs stand in the way of moving fast when gun owners threaten violence.  We re not going to wait for an Uvalde Texas or a Parkland or a Columbine if we have the information and people say that they re going to shoot or kill said Judd who enforced 752 orders since 2020 in a county of 725000 residents a tally that s more than the total orders for 15 entire states. We re going to use the tools that the state gave us.  Florida s traditionally progun Republicanled legislature passed its red flag law in 2018 following revelations police failed to act on repeated threats by an expelled student who would go on to carry out the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland earlier that year that left 17 people dead. A recent highprofile example of a red flag law not being used was for the 21yearold gunman accused of fatally shooting seven people and injuring dozens more at a Fourth of July parade in the Chicago suburb of Highland Park. Robert E. Crimo III drew police attention three years earlier when he threatened to kill everyone in his house and officers acknowledged going to the home several times previously because of a history of attempts to take his own life. But Highland Park police never requested a gun surrender order saying there was no gun belonging to Crimo to take away at the time even though the law has a provision to block threatening people from making future purchases too. WATCH Gun violence in America shows no sign of slowing after new spate of mass shootings Illinois state Rep. Denyse Stoneback said there has clearly been a problem with awareness of the law among those tasked with carrying it out. We d go to police departments and they didn t know anything about it said the Democrat who helped push through a bill last year providing 1 million in police red flag law training. Asked why Chicago had so few red flag firearm restraining orders police spokesman Thomas Ahern said many of the city s gun killings are committed with illegally owned firearms. But Ahern emphasized it remained a priority of the department to increase its awareness and use of the red flag law. If we are able to prevent one citizen from getting hurt or killed that s a law worth having and definitely not a low priority he said. In New York a red flagtype situation that wasn t covered under the state s law nonetheless led to a spike in red flag gun surrender orders. Payton Gendron was a 17yearold high school senior last year when he was investigated by New York s State Police and ordered hospitalized for a mental health evaluation for typing into an economics class online program that his future plans included murdersuicide. But since he was a minor he wasn t covered under the state s red flag law and it didn t prevent him from later buying the highpowered rifle authorities say he used to kill 10 Black people in a raciallymotivated shooting at Buffalo supermarket in May. Since then New York has seen 779 gun surrender orders under its red flag law equal to nearly half of all its orders since the measure took effect three years ago. Several experts said it s impossible to come up with an ideal number of red flag orders and misleading to compare states by orders because of the widely varying rates of gun ownership and gun homicides and suicides among other stats. Another complicating factor is that some states have stricter gun ownerships rules and multiple ways to seize firearms. In California for instance guns can be taken away through domestic violence restraining orders civil harassment protection orders and school violence prevention orders in addition to the red flag law. Still experts consulted by AP agreed more could be done to enforce red flag laws given the prevalence of guns and the millions of gun owners that national studies suggest could be dangerous to themselves and others. In red flag states alone figures compiled by the Gun Violence Archive show at least 21100 homicides and 47000 injuries during the 2 years covered by AP s count. WATCH What research says about identifying people who might commit mass shootings Several studies suggest red flag laws can be particularly effective in preventing gun suicides which kill about 20000 people a year. A Duke University study of Connecticut sfirstinthenation red flag law in 1999 estimated that for every 10 to 20 surrender orders a life from a potential suicide was saved. A study of Indiana s law came up with a similar ratio. While the impact of red flag laws on homicides is less well researched studies suggest many mass shootings could be avoided if the laws were implemented aggressively. A study by the guncontrol advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety showed perpetrators exhibited dangerous warning signs before more than half of the mass shootings in the dozen years through 2020 that accounted for 596 deaths. Such warning signs have led to many opportunities to stop gun violence as well as missed chances. In Colorado in 2020 police seized 59 guns from a man who complained of hit men coming to get him bragged about shooting someone and repeatedly threatened his exwife. In New Jersey in 2019 police took seven guns from a man threatening on Facebook to attack a Walmart. And in Washington state in 2018 police removed 12 guns from the home of a man who posted on social media about killing Jews in a synagogue and kids in a school. But in Indianapolis in 2020 failure to employ all aspects of a red flag law resulted in disaster. After 18yearold Brandon Hole s mother alerted police that he was threatening to commit suicide by cop police seized his pumpaction shotgun. A county prosecutor could have gone further under the law to argue before a judge that Hole should be barred from possessing or buying a gun but that never happened. A few months later Hole bought two ARstyle rifles at a gun store turning to his mother and saying They don t have a flag on me. Several months after that he fatally shot eight employees in a FedEx warehouse where he had worked and injured seven more before killing himself.  I feel the state of Indiana is an accessory to murder a wounded Angela Hughley told the Indianapolis Star shortly after the shooting. Amber Clark a librarian in Sacramento California might still be alive today if police had acted on a tip that Ronald Seay was armed and dangerous. The gunman s twin brother called police in 2018 warning that Seay who had a history of mental illness and trouble with police was making violent threats and had two semiautomatic pistols. But the police never went to a judge to ask for a gun surrender order or tell the sibling that he could do that himself. A few weeks later Seay unloaded 11 bullets into Clark s face and head at pointblank range outside the Sacramento library.  It is obvious to me and my family that the application of California s red flag law in this case would have saved two lives Amber s and the shooter s and prevented immeasurable grief said her husband Kelly Clark. My wife would still be alive and the killer would have received the help he needed instead of being condemned to life in prison.

Connecticut is one of 19 states that have red flag laws to confiscate weapons often used in domestic violence cases. Kassi JacksonHartford Courant via The Associated Press If you or someone you know is concerned about domestic violence you can call 800799SAFE 7233 or visit TheHotline.org for confidential help. The National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 8002738255. Alyssa Shaw s job is to guide Seattlearea residents through what can be one of the most wrenching and complicated experiences of their lives petitioning civil courts to temporarily take away the firearms of a loved one in a mental health crisis who may harm themselves or others. Washington state s extreme risk protection order law often called a red flag law has been on the books for five years but most Washingtonians don t know the law exists let alone the details of the petitioning process said Shaw the state s first red flag law advocate. Often people find out about the law only after they call the police to report that a family or household member is making threats or is experiencing suicidal thoughts. Shaw thinks of herself as a translator of the legal system. She walks family or household members through the petition process often gathering background information about the person who might be a threat asking whether the petitioner feels safe and connecting them with community resources.  Families need support and it just makes the most sense that if we re trying to prevent tragedies from happening that shouldn t just be on the backs of family members said Shaw who works in a multiagency unit that includes the Seattle City Attorney s Office and the King County Prosecuting Attorney s Office. We need to be providing all the support we can.  Red flag laws have become an increasingly popular tool to prevent mass shootings suicides and deadly domestic violence. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted them sometimes with bipartisan support. Fourteen of those laws came after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland Florida a catalyzing event that led to a wave of gun restrictions nationwide. Many law enforcement officials public health researchers and legislators think these laws prevent gun deaths by allowing people to act on early warning signs. But they say the public and even some police officers have so little knowledge of the tool that it isn t used as often as it should be.  Most states allow only law enforcement and family or household members to petition the courts to temporarily seize or prevent the purchase of firearms while some states also offer the option to medical professionals school officials coworkers and current or former partners. Five states meanwhile allow only law enforcement officials to petition. The length of the firearm timeout varies by state but it typically lasts for up to a year. Extreme risk protection orders must meet specific legal standards and petitioners must present evidence which a judge considers in a hearing. Police officers also may collect sworn statements. Initial research in at least one state Colorado suggests law enforcement officers are most likely to have their petitions granted.  The law is not complicated but it is important to get the word out to the public about a law they can actually use to save lives Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum a Democrat told Stateline.  So far this year Oregon courts have issued more than 260 extreme risk protection orders. While the 2017 law is working well Rosenblum said it s not as widely used as it ought to be.  The lack of activity is a common concern said Jeffrey Swanson a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine and one the country s leading researchers on red flag laws.  You pass the law and then nothing happens he said. There s no real systematic efforts to invest in letting people know about it educating the stakeholder groups who need to know about it setting up the infrastructure and protocol to do it.  In Washington state voters approved the red flag law by a ballot initiative. Even though it passed with 69 support just a handful of residents filed petitions in its first two years said Kim Wyatt senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County. Because the legislature did not allocate money for the law s implementation there were no public education efforts. Over the past three years a team of prosecutors and law enforcement officers from King County and Seattle crafted a model policy for jurisdictions throughout the state to follow. Having a point of contact to guide law enforcement and communities through the complicated process was essential said Wyatt who leads the Regional Domestic Violence Firearms Enforcement Unit. Her office has hosted three summits for law enforcement judges prosecutors and community advocates. It also has led training for county crisis line workers crafted training resources for the state s police academy and worked with local Veterans Affairs offices to advise officials on suicide prevention among former members of the military.  There s quite a big list of those to educate and get the word out Wyatt said.  In California twothirds of people polled in 2020 had never heard of the state s red flag law according to a survey by the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center. While the number of petitions has increased since the law s implementation in 2016 that uptick has been slow University of California Davis researchers found. San Diego leads the state in orders and has removed more than 1000 guns from more than 550 people over the past four years.  City Attorney Mara W. Elliott told Stateline that the law is a lifesaving tool. Her office has trained 400 law enforcement agencies throughout California on the red flag law and how to file petitions known in the state as gun violence restraining orders. California allocated 1 million over the next three years for San Diego s statewide training efforts. In Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation in August that adds yearly training on the state s red flag law for law enforcement officers and creates a public education campaign through the state Department of Public Health. The state s original law signed in 2018 by thenGov. Bruce Rauner a Republican lacked the funding for either of these resources.  The original law in Illinois was being underused said Democratic state Rep. Denyse Stoneback the primary sponsor of this year s bill.   We really needed to get the word out she said in an interview with Stateline.  Colorado took a similar step this year. In June Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed into law a measure that creates the Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the state s Department of Public Health and Environment. The new office will lead the state s public education and training efforts on the red flag law that took effect in 2020. The legislature appropriated 3 million for the office to educate residents nonprofit officials health care providers and law enforcement about the availability and process of filing a petition to seize weapons. In its first year Colorado s red flag law produced fewer than 125 extreme risk protection orders. Courts denied 46 petitions to seize firearms.   What the public needs to know is we need your engagement and your awareness Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser said. If individuals know about a risk but they don t know that there s this tool to save this person s life by removing their firearm it may never be used appropriately.  In Douglas County just south of the Denver area Sheriff Tony Spurlock is a leading advocate for the state s law at times taking political heat from gun rights advocates who question the law s due process protections. But Spurlock an avid Second Amendment supporter insists the law is saving lives. All four people who were subjects of petitions in his community are still alive today he noted.   It s our responsibility to protect our citizens from harm he said. We have a tool that is very valuable and will make a difference in the community.  Spurlock a Republican has shared his policies and training materials with several police and sheriffs departments in the state. His office also released a podcast and a Facebook Live for residents to better understand the law. He now hopes to be involved in a statewide educational effort about the law. The best way to increase the use of extreme risk protection orders is to train law enforcement officers said Shannon Frattaroli a professor of public health at Johns Hopkins University.  It s more strategic and effective to invest in the people who are the professionals and who will be in contact with those who are in crisis themselves or supporting people in crisis she said.  Frattaroli points to Maryland as a state that has been effective in implementing its law. She gives significant credit to the law enforcement officials who helped draft the legislation and legitimize it in the eyes of those tasked with carrying it out.  The measure signed in 2018 by Republican Gov. Larry Hogan was in part championed by Darren Popkin the sheriff for Montgomery County which borders Washington D.C. In the five months between the passage of the law and its implementation Popkin a Democrat traveled around the state training local law enforcement agencies state police officers and sheriffs. With that knowledge officers responding to incidents of domestic violence or other related calls can introduce families to the red flag law and walk them through the process. Courts in Maryland can process petitions 24 hours a day so there isn t a delay in seizing firearms in critical situations. In Maryland about half of petitions are filed by law enforcement and the other half by family or household members with a smattering of petitions coming from mental health providers. In other states law enforcement officers file nearly every petition.  Popkin credits that to his statewide training program When officers respond to a 911 call they inform residents of the red flag law when appropriate.   When officers knock on the door he said I do expect 100 of them are aware of extreme risk protection orders.  In other areas of the country local law enforcement agencies have had to take the initiative. After a shooter killed 17 students and faculty at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in 2018 Florida quickly passed a red flag law. Signed by thenGov. Rick Scott a Republican the law did not include funding to train officers statewide. That burden has been put on local police departments. Fort Lauderdale Detective Christopher Carita serves on the sixperson Threat Response Unit that investigates threats that could lead to a mass casualty incident often employing extreme risk protection orders. Without guidance from the state Carita drafted a lesson plan for his fellow Fort Lauderdale officers and new recruits on the best practices for the red flag law.  This is about having a tool that gives someone assurance that the ultimate goal is not to hurt them or lock them up he said. It s to save their life or prevent them from doing something they can t undo.

The National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 8002738255. Alyssa Shaw s job is to guide Seattlearea residents through what can be one of the most wrenching and complicated experiences of their lives petitioning civil courts to temporarily take away the firearms of a loved one in a mental health crisis who may harm themselves or others. Washington state s extreme risk protection order law often called a red flag law has been on the books for five years but most Washingtonians don t know the law exists let alone the details of the petitioning process said Shaw the state s first red flag law advocate. Often people find out about the law only after they call the police to report that a family or household member is making threats or is experiencing suicidal thoughts. Shaw thinks of herself as a translator of the legal system. She walks family or household members through the petition process often gathering background information about the person who might be a threat asking whether the petitioner feels safe and connecting them with community resources.  Families need support and it just makes the most sense that if we re trying to prevent tragedies from happening that shouldn t just be on the backs of family members said Shaw who works in a multiagency unit that includes the Seattle City Attorney s Office and the King County Prosecuting Attorney s Office. We need to be providing all the support we can.  Red flag laws have become an increasingly popular tool to prevent mass shootings suicides and deadly domestic violence. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia have adopted them sometimes with bipartisan support. Fourteen of those laws came after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland Florida a catalyzing event that led to a wave of gun restrictions nationwide. Many law enforcement officials public health researchers and legislators think these laws prevent gun deaths by allowing people to act on early warning signs. But they say the public and even some police officers have so little knowledge of the tool that it isn t used as often as it should be.  Most states allow only law enforcement and family or household members to petition the courts to temporarily seize or prevent the purchase of firearms while some states also offer the option to medical professionals school officials coworkers and current or former partners. Five states meanwhile allow only law enforcement officials to petition. The length of the firearm timeout varies by state but it typically lasts for up to a year. Extreme risk protection orders must meet specific legal standards and petitioners must present evidence which a judge considers in a hearing. Police officers also may collect sworn statements. Initial research in at least one state Colorado suggests law enforcement officers are most likely to have their petitions granted.  The law is not complicated but it is important to get the word out to the public about a law they can actually use to save lives Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum a Democrat told Stateline.  So far this year Oregon courts have issued more than 260 extreme risk protection orders. While the 2017 law is working well Rosenblum said it s not as widely used as it ought to be.  The lack of activity is a common concern said Jeffrey Swanson a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke University School of Medicine and one the country s leading researchers on red flag laws.  You pass the law and then nothing happens he said. There s no real systematic efforts to invest in letting people know about it educating the stakeholder groups who need to know about it setting up the infrastructure and protocol to do it.  In Washington state voters approved the red flag law by a ballot initiative. Even though it passed with 69 support just a handful of residents filed petitions in its first two years said Kim Wyatt senior deputy prosecuting attorney for King County. Because the legislature did not allocate money for the law s implementation there were no public education efforts. Over the past three years a team of prosecutors and law enforcement officers from King County and Seattle crafted a model policy for jurisdictions throughout the state to follow. Having a point of contact to guide law enforcement and communities through the complicated process was essential said Wyatt who leads the Regional Domestic Violence Firearms Enforcement Unit. Her office has hosted three summits for law enforcement judges prosecutors and community advocates. It also has led training for county crisis line workers crafted training resources for the state s police academy and worked with local Veterans Affairs offices to advise officials on suicide prevention among former members of the military.  There s quite a big list of those to educate and get the word out Wyatt said.  In California twothirds of people polled in 2020 had never heard of the state s red flag law according to a survey by the University of California Firearm Violence Research Center. While the number of petitions has increased since the law s implementation in 2016 that uptick has been slow University of California Davis researchers found. San Diego leads the state in orders and has removed more than 1000 guns from more than 550 people over the past four years.  City Attorney Mara W. Elliott told Stateline that the law is a lifesaving tool. Her office has trained 400 law enforcement agencies throughout California on the red flag law and how to file petitions known in the state as gun violence restraining orders. California allocated 1 million over the next three years for San Diego s statewide training efforts. In Illinois Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker signed legislation in August that adds yearly training on the state s red flag law for law enforcement officers and creates a public education campaign through the state Department of Public Health. The state s original law signed in 2018 by thenGov. Bruce Rauner a Republican lacked the funding for either of these resources.  The original law in Illinois was being underused said Democratic state Rep. Denyse Stoneback the primary sponsor of this year s bill.   We really needed to get the word out she said in an interview with Stateline.  Colorado took a similar step this year. In June Democratic Gov. Jared Polis signed into law a measure that creates the Office of Gun Violence Prevention in the state s Department of Public Health and Environment. The new office will lead the state s public education and training efforts on the red flag law that took effect in 2020. The legislature appropriated 3 million for the office to educate residents nonprofit officials health care providers and law enforcement about the availability and process of filing a petition to seize weapons. In its first year Colorado s red flag law produced fewer than 125 extreme risk protection orders. Courts denied 46 petitions to seize firearms.   What the public needs to know is we need your engagement and your awareness Democratic Attorney General Phil Weiser said. If individuals know about a risk but they don t know that there s this tool to save this person s life by removing their firearm it may never be used appropriately.
