General Reference not clearly pro or conThe Congressional Research Service CRS published a report on Dec. 15 2004 titled Affirmative Action Revisited A Legal History and Prospectus   The origins of affirmative action law may be traced to the early 1960 s Judicial rulings from this period recognized an affirmative duty cast upon local school boards by the Equal Protection Clause to desegregate formerly dual school systems and to eliminate root and branch the last vestiges of stateenforced segregation  Congress and the Executive Branch soon followed by adopting a panoply of laws and regulations authorizing either directly or by judicial or administrative interpretation raceconscious strategies to promote minority opportunity in jobs education and governmental contracting. The basic statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education derives from the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Public and private employers with 15 or more employees are subject to a comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under Title VII of the 1964 Act  Official approval of affirmative action remedies was further codified by federal regulations construing the 1964 Act s Title VI which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs and activities including public or private educational institutions. The Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education interpreted Title VI to require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination and to encourage voluntary affirmative action to attain a diverse student body.  The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU stated the following in its Mar. 21 2008 publication Striving for Equal Opportunity Why the ACLU Supports Affirmative Action available at www.aclu.org  We have come a long way since the Civil Rights Movement and many Americans feel that the time for affirmative action is over. Opportunities for women and people of color have expanded and many believe that the unequal conditions that once justified affirmative action no longer exist. Sadly this is just not true. Millions of Americans continue to experience race and gender barriers in education contracting and employment. Existing laws help to prevent outright discrimination on the basis of race and gender but they alone are not enough to create equal opportunities for every American. Affirmative action programs including targeted outreach and recruitment efforts the use of nontraditional criteria for hiring and admissions afterschool and mentorship programs and training and apprenticeship opportunities are tailored to fit specific instances where race and gender must be taken into account in order to provide fair and equal access to minorities and women. These programs recognize and strive to correct the barriers that continue to block the paths of many individual Americans including women Native Americans Arab Americans Latinos Asian Americans and African Americans. Affirmative action helps ensure equal access to opportunities and brings our nation closer to the ideal of giving everyone a fair chance. We support affirmative action and other race and genderconscious policies as vital tools in the struggle to provide all Americans with equal opportunity to promote diversity in academic and professional settings and to give each and every one of us a fair chance to compete.  Reginald T. Shuford JD Senior Staff Attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union Foundation Racial Justice Program stated the following in his May 21 2009 article Why Affirmative Action Remains Essential in the Age of Obama published in the Campbell Law Review  Whether in the arenas of housing employment education wealth health care or the justice system African Americans Latinos and Native Americans continue to lag way behind others. By way of example according to one study of over 1300 employers in Boston and Chicago job applicants with whitesounding names are twice as likely to be called back for interviews as equally qualified applicants with blacksounding names. More than one million students will not graduate from high school this year and a disproportionate number of them will be AfricanAmerican Latino or Native American. AfricanAmerican women moreover earn only sixtythree cents per hour and Hispanic women only fiftytwo cents per hour for every dollar a white man earns for similar employment. Given its welldocumented effectiveness affirmative action is an appropriate tool for combating these and other ongoing disparities  While it is abundantly clear that America has made laudable progress towards racial equality as reflected in part by the election of Barack Obama as the nation s fortyfourth president America s promise of a fully inclusive society has not materialized. In light of all the relevant evidence America has not fulfilled Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. s dream of a truly equal society. While Obama s election qualifies as a down payment on equality much more remains to be done. Affirmative action which is just one of many effective tools for expanding opportunity remains essential for the full inclusion of all of those who historically have been and continue to be structurally relegated to the margins of society and who are increasingly left further behind in the race to achieve the American Dream.  Barack Obama JD 44th President of the United States provided the following statement on affirmative action to the NAACP 2008 Voter Action Center accessed Nov. 16 2009  I support affirmative action. When there is strong evidence of prolonged and systemic discrimination by organizations affirmative action may be the only meaningful remedy available. Given the dearth of black and Latino Ph.D. candidates in mathematics and the sciences for example a scholarship program for minorities interested in getting advanced degrees in these fields won t keep white students out of such programs but can broaden the pool of talent that we need to prosper in the new economy. We shouldn t ignore that race continues to matter To suggest that our racial attitudes play no part in the socioeconomic disparities that we often observe turns a blind eye to both our history and our experience and relieves us of the responsibility to make things right.  Scott Plous PhD Professor of Psychology at Wesleyan University wrote in his article Ten Myths About Affirmative Action posted on his website accessed Aug. 17 2005  Several studies have documented important gains in racial and gender equality as a direct result of affirmative action  Despite the progress that has been made the playing field is far from level. Women continue to earn 76 cents for every male dollar Black people continue to have twice the unemployment rate of White people twice the rate of infant mortality and just over half the proportion of people who attend four years or more of college In fact without affirmative action the percentage of Black students at many selective schools would drop to only 2 of the student body  Some writers have criticized affirmative action as a superficial solution that does not address deeper societal problems by redistributing wealth and developing true educational equality. Yet affirmative action was never proposed as a cureall solution to inequality. Rather it was intended only to redress discrimination in hiring and academic admissions. In assessing the value of affirmative action the central question is merely this In the absence of sweeping societal reforms unlikely to take place any time soon does affirmative action help counteract the continuing injustice caused by discrimination? The research record suggests unequivocally that it does.  The National Organization for Women NOW a national feminist organization stated the following in its article Talking About Affirmative Action available at www.now.org accessed Nov. 19 2009  Affirmative Action levels the playing field so people of color and all women have the chance to compete in education and in business. White men hold 95 to 97 of the highlevel corporate jobs. And that s with affirmative action programs in place. Imagine how low figures would be without affirmative action  Despite the enormous gains made by the civil rights and women s rights movements women and people of color still face unfair obstacles in business and education. An astonishing 70 of schools are not in compliance with Title IX the federal equal education opportunity law  Affirmative Action programs merely acknowledge that hundreds of years of discrimination cannot be erased in a few decades and still hold women and people of color back. Affirmative Action is the bridge between changing the laws and changing the culture. The radical right wing would have us believe that women and people of color earn less because we don t work as hard or we re not as smart. That simply isn t the case. Laws have changed but discrimination persists. Affirmative Action only opens doors women and people of color have to walk through those doors by themselves.  John A. Farrell Contributing Editor at US News and World Report stated the following in his June 10 2009 article Obama s Election Shows That Affirmative Action s Day Has Passed published in US News and World Report  In 2003 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against Barbara Grutter a white college grad who sued the University of Michigan law school because it employed racial preferences in its admissions process to achieve academic diversity. Justice Sandra Day O Connor joined the court s four liberal justices to keep affirmative action alive that day in a 5to4 decision. But the moment was fast approaching O Connor said when the promotion of people of color solely because of their race would not be justified. No one knew precisely when the tipping point would be reached O Connor wrote but the court expects that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary. Five years later Barack Obama was elected president of the United States. Obama s election was the sign we ve been waiting for. It is time we do away with preferences and recognize people as Martin Luther King urged us by the content of their character. Today a black man sits in the Oval Office having narrowly defeated a woman for the Democratic nomination whom to considerable acclaim he then appointed secretary of state.  Clint Bolick JD Director of the Goldwater Institute stated the following in his June 29 2009 article The Supreme Court and New Haven s Firefighters published in Forbes  When blacks and Hispanics flunk examinations the cause is less likely to be discrimination than the appalling educational conditions to which most economically disadvantaged black and Hispanic children are consigned. Affirmative action programs that leapfrog lessqualified minorities over morequalified nonminorities sweep those systemic problems under the carpet. As such racebased affirmative action programs perpetuate fraud upon the very groups they are designed to help.  Ward Connerly former University of California Regent in his Mar. 27. 2000 interview with Salon.com titled A Poison Divides Us stated  In my view using the powers of government to make sure that people are not discriminated against I think that was the original intent of affirmative action But when it gets to the point where you are making a selection for someone to be admitted to the university or someone to be hired for a job and to have one standard for someone who is black and another standard for someone who is white I think that s a preference I think that when you apply different standards to people that s discriminatory no matter what you want to call it  But as long as you have this paradigm where people seem to be using race and gender as a means of making hiring decisions as long as they keep uttering this mindless blather about we ve got to achieve diversity it kind of taints the whole process. And the decisions that they re making would be no different in my view if they just discarded the whole system  If we really wanted to help black people let s just take black people for an example we would not be putting so much emphasis on getting them into Berkeley as we would giving them the equivalent money to go out and buy their own cabs or get the tools to become an electrician or a plumber or the money to take a vocational course But we don t even look at that. If I proposed that they d think I was a kook because we re so hung up on the notion that you either go to college or life s a failure. And if you don t get into Berkeley and you re black there must be some institutional racism there.  Jeff Jacoby JD Columnist at the Boston Globe wrote in his Mar. 19 2004 article titled On Flattering Minorities for Townhall.com  Once upon time it was racists who insisted that nonwhite was a synonym for intellectually deficient. Today that attitude is promoted most emphatically by the defenders of affirmative action a system rooted in the belief that blacks and certain other minorities can t hope to win if they have to compete on a level playing field. And so racial preferences are used to tilt the field in their favor lower admissions standards at colleges and graduate schools minority setasides for government contracts unofficial racial quotas to benefit those applying for jobs. Racial preferences are clearly a boon for some minorities particularly those from uppermiddleclass families who know how to leverage them to get into a good school or land a good job or get in on a good investment. But they do no favors for minority groups as a whole. Preferences stigmatize them as less able than other Americans to stand on their own two feet. Many end up resenting those who believe they need such a crutch as well as resenting those who would take the crutch away  Fortunately there was no affirmative action at the turn of the 20th century to give members of beaten races a leg up in the competition for education and jobs. They had to rise on their own merits if they were to overcome the stigma of inferiority and rise and overcome they did. Black and Hispanic Americans would rise and overcome as well if only they could be liberated from the condescending mindset that thinks it s a compliment to tell a group of college seniors that they show great promise for minorities.  Dana White International Communications Associate at the Heritage Foundation wrote in her June 27 2003 article titled Who Says I m Inferior?   Thirty years ago affirmative action may have been a necessary step to open the doors of American universities and companies. It helped to correct a history of racial discrimination propagated by whites but it s a new day in America  Too many blacks do remain oppressed but not by white Americans. Rather it is by blacks who relish a perverse subculture of low standards and perpetual victimization. No longer do white racists tell black children books are for white people. Today black people do this. Every day black children suffer ridicule and disgrace for doing their homework behaving in class striving for excellence in short acting white.  Affirmative action helps the children and the grandchildren of Jesse Jackson John Conyers and Al Sharpton who have the money for the SAT prep courses private schools and the clout to call the deans of admission should something go awry It is time for liberal black leaders to stop hiding behind racism and admit that our priorities as a community have become our greatest hurdle to achieving longterm success.

Bakke the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy. Many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty. Justice Powell in his opinion for the Bakke Court stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education noting that the atmosphere of speculation experiment and creation so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body. In subsequent years however federal courts began to question the Powell rationale unsettling expectations about whether diversitybased affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. After a series of conflicting lower court rulings were issued regarding the use of race to promote a diverse student body the Supreme Court agreed to review the raceconscious admissions policies used by the undergraduate and law school admissions programs at the University of Michigan. In Grutter v. Bollinger a 5 to 4 majority of the Justices held that the law school had a compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body which justified its racebased efforts to assemble a critical mass of underrepresented minority students. But in the companion decision Gratz v. Bollinger six Justices decided that the University s policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional scrutiny. The decisions resolved for the time being the doctrinal muddle left in Bakke s wake. And because the Court s constitutional holdings translate to the private sector under the federal civil rights laws nonpublic schools colleges and universities are likewise affected. However the Grutter and Gratz decisions did not address whether diversity is a permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting. To resolve this question the Supreme Court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools and to avoid racial segregation. In a consolidated 2007 ruling in Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 the Court struck down the Seattle and Louisville school plans at issue holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment. More recently the Court s decision to hear challenges in two separate affirmative action cases has once again revived the issue of diversity in higher education. In its 2013 ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin the Court reaffirmed its holding in Grutter but nevertheless vacated and remanded an appellate court s decision to uphold a raceconscious undergraduate admissions plan at the University of Texas at Austin. However on remand the appellate court upheld the university s admissions program for a second time a decision that appeared to prompt the Court to agree to review the case yet again during its 2015 term. Meanwhile in 2014 s Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action the Court upheld Michigan s Proposal 2 which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education.

Almost four decades after the Supreme Court ruling in Regents of the University of California v. Bakke1 the diversity rationale for affirmative action in public education remains a topic of political and legal controversy. Many colleges and universities have implemented affirmative action policies not only to remedy past discrimination but also to achieve a racially and ethnically diverse student body or faculty. Justice Powell in his opinion for the Bakke Court stated that the attainment of a diverse student body is a constitutionally permissible goal for an institution of higher education noting that the atmosphere of speculation experiment and creation so essential to the quality of higher education is widely believed to be promoted by a diverse student body.2 In subsequent years however federal courts began to question the Powell rationale unsettling expectations about whether diversitybased affirmative action in educational admissions and faculty hiring decisions is constitutional under the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In striking down the admissions process at the University of Texas School of Law the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Hopwood v. Texas concluded that any use of race in the admissions process was forbidden by the Constitution.3 Reverberations of the 1996 Hopwood opinion are apparent in several subsequent cases which voided raceconscious policies maintained by institutions of higher education as well as public elementary and secondary schools. Some judges avoided resolving the precedential effect of Justice Powells opinion by deciding the case on other grounds not dependent on the constitutional status of student diversity as a compelling state interest.4 But in Johnson v. Board of Regents the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals sided with Hopwood by rejecting diversity as constitutional justification for a numerical racial bonus awarded minority freshman applicants to the University of Georgia. A circuit court conflict was created when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit relied on Bakke to uphold an affirmative action admissions policy to the University of Washington Law School that made extensive use of racebased factors. Smith v. University of Washington was the first federal appeals court to rely on Justice Powells decision as binding precedent on the issue.5 The judicial divide over Bakkes legacy was vividly underscored by a pair of separate trial court decisions one upholding for diversity reasons the racebased undergraduate admissions policy of the University of Michigan6 the other voiding a special minority law school admissions program at the same institution.7 Restoring a degree of clarity to the law the Supreme Court concluded its 2002 term with rulings in the Michigan cases. In Grutter v. Bollinger8 a 5 to 4 majority of the Justices held that the law school had a compelling interest in the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body which justified its consideration of race in admissions to assemble a critical mass of underrepresented minority students. But in a companion decision Gratz v. Bollinger9 six Justices decided that the universitys policy of awarding racial bonus points to minority applicants was not narrowly tailored enough to pass constitutional scrutiny. However the Grutter and Gratz decisions did not address whether diversity is a permissible goal in the elementary and secondary educational setting. To resolve this question the Court agreed to review two cases that involved the use of race to maintain racially diverse public schools. The cases were Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education formerly MacFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools and Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1.10 In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 a consolidated 2007 ruling that resolved both cases the Court ultimately struck down the school plans at issue holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.11 More recently the Courts decision to hear challenges in two separate affirmative action cases has once again revived the issue of diversity in higher education. In its 2013 ruling in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin the Court reaffirmed its holding in Grutter but nevertheless vacated and remanded an appellate courts decision to uphold a raceconscious undergraduate admissions plan at the University of Texas at Austin.12 However on remand the appellate court upheld the universitys admissions program for a second time13 a decision that appeared to prompt the Court to agree to review the case yet again during its 2015 term.14 Meanwhile in 2014s Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action the Court upheld Michigans Proposal 2 which prohibits the use of racial preferences in higher education.15 The first part of this report briefly reviews the judicial evolution of racebased affirmative action particularly in relation to public education. The report then reviews major rulings involving challenges to the use of raceconscious admissions and concludes with a discussion of the implications for the future of affirmative action law. The origins of affirmative action law may be traced to the early 1960s as first the Warren and then the Burger Court grappled with the seemingly intractable problem of racial segregation in the nations public schools. Judicial rulings from this period recognized an affirmative duty cast upon local school boards by the equal protection clause to desegregate formerly dual school systems and to eliminate root and branch the last vestiges of stateenforced segregation.16 These holdings ushered in a twodecade era of massive desegregation first in the South and later the urban North marked by federal desegregation orders frequently requiring drastic reconfiguration of school attendance patterns along racial lines and extensive student transportation schemes. School districts across the nation operating under these decrees have since sought to be declared in compliance with constitutional requirements in order to gain release from federal intervention. The Supreme Court eventually responded by holding that judicial control of a school system previously found guilty of intentional segregation should be relinquished if looking to all aspects of school operations it appears that the district has complied with desegregation requirements in good faith for a reasonable period of time and has eliminated vestiges of past discrimination to the extent practicable.17 A statutory framework for affirmative action in employment and education was enacted by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Public and private employers with 15 or more employees are subject to a comprehensive code of equal employment opportunity regulations under Title VII of the 1964 act. The Title VII remedial scheme rests largely on judicial power to order monetary damages and injunctive relief including such affirmative action as may be appropriate18 to make discrimination victims whole. Except as may be imposed by court order or consent decree to remedy past discrimination however there is no general statutory obligation on employers to adopt affirmative action remedies. But the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC has issued guidelines to protect employers and unions from charges of reverse discrimination when they voluntarily take action to correct the effects of past discrimination.19 The term affirmative action resurfaced in federal regulations construing the 1964 acts Title VI which prohibits racial or ethnic discrimination in all federally assisted programs or activities20 including public or private educational institutions. The Office of Civil Rights of the Department of Education interpreted Title VI to require schools and colleges to take affirmative action to overcome the effects of past discrimination and to encourage voluntary affirmative action to attain a diverse student body.21 Another Title VI regulation permits a college or university to take racial or national origin into account when awarding financial aid if the aid is necessary to overcome effects of past institutional discrimination.22 Affirmative action in higher education also came before Congress in 1998 when the full House defeated a bill to prohibit federal aid to colleges and universities that consider race ethnicity or sex in the admission process. The Bakke ruling in 1978 launched the contemporary constitutional debate over statesponsored affirmative action. A notable lack of unanimity was evident from the six separate opinions filed in that case. One fourJustice plurality in Bakke voted to strike down as a violation of Title VI a special admissions program of the University of California at Davis medical school which set aside 16 of 100 positions in each incoming class for minority students though the institution itself was not shown to have discriminated in the past. Another bloc of four Justices argued that racial classifications designed to further remedial purposes were foreclosed neither by the Constitution nor the Civil Rights Act and would have upheld the minority admissions quota. Justice Powell added a fifth vote to each camp by condemning the Davis program on equal protection grounds while endorsing the nonexclusive consideration of race as an admissions criterion to foster student diversity. In Justice Powells view neither the states asserted interest in remedying societal discrimination nor of providing role models for minority students was sufficiently compelling to warrant the use of a suspect racial classification in the admission process. But the attainment of a diverse student body was for Justice Powell clearly a permissible goal for an institution of higher education since diversity of minority viewpoints furthered academic freedom a special concern of the First Amendment.23 Accordingly race could be considered by a university as a plus or one element of a range of factors even if it tipped the scale among qualified applicants as long as it did not insulate the individual from comparison with all the other candidates for the available seats.24 The quota in Bakke was infirm however since it defined diversity only in racial terms and absolutely excluded nonminorities from a given number of seats. By two 5to4 votes therefore the Supreme Court affirmed the lower court order admitting Bakke but reversed the judicial ban on consideration of race in admissions. Bakke was followed by Wygant v. Jackson Board of Education25 where a divided Court ruled unconstitutional the provision of a collective bargaining agreement that protected minority public school teachers from layoff at the expense of more senior white faculty members. While holding the specific layoff preference for minority teachers unconstitutional seven Wygant Justices seemed to agree in principle that a governmental employer is not prohibited by the equal protection clause from all raceconscious affirmative action to remedy its own past discrimination. Another series of decisions approved of congressionally mandated racial preferences to allocate the benefits of contracts on federally sponsored public works projects26 and in the design of certain broadcast licensing schemes27 while condemning similar actions taken by local governmental entities to promote public contracting opportunities for minority entrepreneurs.28 However in each of these cases the Justices failed to achieve a consensus on most issues with bare majorities pluralities or as in Bakke a single Justice determining the outcome of the case. By the mid1980s the Supreme Court had approved the temporary remedial use of race or genderconscious selection criteria by private employers under Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.29 These measures were deemed a proper remedy for manifest racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories if voluntarily adopted by the employer30 or for entrenched patterns of egregious and longstanding discrimination by the employer if imposed by judicial decree.31 In either circumstance however the Court required proof of remedial justification rooted in the employers own past discrimination and its persistent workplace effects. Thus a firm basis in evidence as revealed by a manifest imbalance or historic persistent and egregious underrepresentation of minorities or women in affected job categories was deemed an essential predicate to preferential affirmative action. Second but of equal importance all racial preferences in employment were to be judged in terms of their adverse impact on identifiable nonminority group members. Remedies that protected minorities from layoff for example were most suspect and unlikely to pass legal or constitutional muster if they displaced more senior white workers. But the consideration of race or gender as a plus factor in employment decisions when it did not unduly hinder the legitimate expectations of nonminority employees won ready judicial acceptance.32 Affirmative action preferences however had to be sufficiently flexible temporary in duration and narrowly tailored to avoid becoming rigid quotas. Not until 1989 however did a majority of the Justices resolve the proper constitutional standard for reviewing equal protection challenges to governmental classifications by race enacted for a remedial or other benign legislative purpose. Disputes prior to City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson33 yielded divergent views as to whether state affirmative action measures for the benefit of racial minorities were subject to the same strict scrutiny as applied to invidious racial discrimination under the equal protection clause an intermediate standard resembling the test for genderbased classifications or simple rationality. In Croson a 5to4 majority settled on strict scrutiny to invalidate a 30 setaside of city contracts for minorityowned businesses because the program was not narrowly tailored to a compelling governmental interest. While raceconscious remedies could be legislated in response to proven past discrimination by the affected governmental entities racial balancing untailored to specific and identified evidence of minority exclusion was impermissible. Croson suggested however that because of its unique equal protection enforcement authority a constitutional standard more tolerant of racial linedrawing may apply to Congress. This conclusion was reinforced a year later when in Metro Broadcasting Inc. v. FCC34 the Court upheld certain minority broadcast licensing schemes approved by Congress to promote the important governmental interest in broadcast diversity. The twotiered approach to equal protection analysis of governmental affirmative action was shortlived. In Adarand Constructors Inc. v. Pena35 the Court applied strict scrutiny to a federal transportation program of financial incentives for prime contractors who subcontracted to firms owned by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals defined so as to prefer members of designated racial minorities. Although the Court refrained from deciding the constitutional merits of the particular program before it and remanded for further proceedings below it determined that all racial classifications by government at any level must be justified by a compelling governmental interest and narrowly tailored to that end. But the majority opinion sought to dispel the notion that strict scrutiny is strict in theory but fatal in fact by acknowledging a role for Congress as architect of remedies for discrimination nationwide. The unhappy persistence of both the practices and lingering effects of racial discrimination against minorities in this country is an unfortunate reality and the government is not disqualified from acting in response to it.36 No further guidance was provided however as to the scope of remedial power remaining in congressional hands or of the conditions required for its exercise. Bottom line Adarand suggests that racial preferences in federal law or policy are a remedy of last resort and must be adequately justified and narrowly drawn to pass constitutional muster. Over the years the Supreme Court has addressed the constitutionality of affirmative action in a variety of educational contexts including both higher education and elementary and secondary education. Each of these contexts is discussed separately below. Beginning with Bakke the Court has heard four different challenges to raceconscious admissions plans at institutions including the recent Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin case. The emphasis in Adarand on past discrimination prompted a surge in judicial challenges to educational diversity as an independent justification for student and faculty affirmative action. The notion that diversity could rise to the level of a compelling interest in the educational setting sprang a quarter century ago from Justice Powells opinion in the Bakke case. While concluding that a state medical school could not setaside a certain number of seats for minority applicants Justice Powell opined that a diverse student body may serve educators legitimate interest in promoting the robust exchange of ideas. He cautioned however that the diversity that furthers a compelling state interest encompasses a far broader array of qualifications and characteristics of which ethnic origin is but a single though important element.37 Justice Powell split the difference between two fourJustice pluralities in Bakke. One camp led by Justice Stevens struck down the admissions quota on statutory civil rights grounds. Another led by Justice Brennan would have upheld the medical schools policy as a remedy for societal discrimination. Justice Powell held the dual admissions procedure to be unconstitutional and ordered Bakkes admission. But he concluded the states interest in educational diversity could warrant consideration of students race in certain circumstances. For Justice Powell a diverse student body fostered the robust exchange of ideas and academic freedom deserving of constitutional protection. Justice Powells theory of diversity as a compelling governmental interest did not turn on race alone. He pointed with approval to the Harvard Plan which defined diversity in terms of a broad array of factors and characteristics. Thus an applicants race could be deemed a plus factor that was considered on a par with personal talents leadership qualities family background or any other factor contributing to a diverse student body. However the race of a candidate could not be the sole or determinative factor. No other Justice joined in the Powell opinion. Although Justice Powells opinion announced the judgment of the Court no other Bakke Justices joined him on that point. Justice Powell ruled the program at issue to be unconstitutional and the white male plaintiff entitled to admission while four other Justices reached the same result on statutory rather than constitutional grounds. Another four Justice plurality concluded that the challenged policy was lawful but agreed with Justice Powell that the state court had erred by holding that an applicants race could never be taken into account. Only Justice Powell therefore expressed the view that the attainment of a diverse student body could be a compelling state interest. For nearly two decades colleges and universities relied on the Powell opinion in Bakke to support raceconscious student diversity policies. Consideration of race in admissions which took various forms stood pretty much unchallenged until Hopwood v. State of Texas.38 A panel of the Fifth Circuit repudiated the Powell diversity rationale when it voided a special admission program of the University of Texas law school. Unlike Bakke the Texas program entailed no explicit racial quota. But in other respects it was a classic dualtrack system with one standard for blacks and Hispanics and another for everyone else. Cutoff scores for minorities were lower as well. The Powell opinion was not binding precedent the Hopwood panel ruled since it was not joined by any other Justice. Thus race could be considered in admissions only to remedy past discrimination by the law school itself which was not shown in Hopwood. Several other federal circuit courts besides the Sixth Circuit in the Michigan case looked at racebased college admissions after Bakke. For example Johnson v. Board of Regents39 struck down the award of racial bonus points to minority students as one of 12 factors academic and nonacademic considered for freshman admissions to the University of Georgia. The Eleventh Circuit majority was skeptical of the Powell opinion but did not take a stand on the diversity issue. Instead the program failed the second requirement of strict scrutiny because it was not narrowly tailored. That is it mechanically awards an arbitrary diversity bonus to each and every nonwhite applicant at a decisive stage in the admissions process.40 At the same time the policy arbitrarily limited the number of nonracial factors that could be considered all at the expense of white applicants even those whose social or economic background and personal traits would promote experiential diversity. On the other hand the Ninth Circuit upheld the minority law school admissions program at the University of Washington on the basis of Bakke. The appeals court in Smith v. University of Washington Law School41 concluded that the four Brennan Justices who approved of the racial quota in Bakke would have embraced the diversity rationale if need be.42 Justice Powells opinion thus became the narrowest footing for approval of race in admission and was the holding of Bakke. PostBakke appeals courts guided by Marks v. United States43 sliced and diced the various opinions in Bakke to come up with a controlling rationale. In Marks the Supreme Court ruled that when a majority of Justices are unable to agree on a controlling rationale the holding of the Court is the position of those Justices concurring in the judgment on the narrowest grounds. The prodiversity circuits concluded that the Powell opinion approving race as a plus factor was narrower than the Brennan rationale which would have upheld the race quota in Bakke on a societal discrimination theory. The opposing circuits had generally reasoned otherwise or concluded that the competing Bakke opinions defy rational comparison so that absent a majority consensus the Powell opinion was without controlling weight. In no way bound by Bakke Supreme Court review of the Michigan cases augured fundamental reexamination of issues raised by that earlier precedent. The judicial divide over the student diversity policies deepened with the University of Michigan cases. One federal district court in Grutter originally struck down the student diversity policy of the University of Michigan Law School44 while another judge upheld a procedure awarding points to underrepresented minority applicants to the undergraduate school.45 Based on Bakke the Sixth Circuit reversed Grutter and permitted the law school to consider race in admissions.46 The Supreme Court granted certiorari in Grutter and agreed to review Gratz prior to judgment by the Sixth Circuit. Undergraduate admission to the University of Michigan had been based on a point system or student selection index. A total possible 150 points could be awarded for factors academic and otherwise that made up the selection index. Academic factors accounted for up to 110 points including 12 for standardized test performance. By comparison 20 points could be awarded for one but only one of the following membership in an underrepresented minority group socioeconomic disadvantage or athletics. Applicants could receive one to four points for alumni relationships three points for personal essay five points for community leadership and service six points for instate residency etc. In practice students at the extremes of academic performance were typically admitted or rejected on that basis alone. But for the middle range of qualified applicants these other factors were often determinative. Finally counselors could flag applications for review by the Admissions Review Committee where any factor important to the freshman class composition race included was not adequately reflected in the selection index score. In upholding this policy the district court in Gratz found that Bakke and the Universitys own evidence demonstrating the educational benefits of racial and ethnic diversity established a compelling state interest. And the award of 20 points for minority status was not a quota or dualtrack system as in Bakke but only a plus factor to be weighed against others in the selection process. Thus the constitutional demand for narrow tailoring was satisfied. The Gratz district court also concluded that vigorous minority recruitment and other raceneutral alternatives to the current policy would not yield a sufficiently diverse student body. Generally setting the bar for admission to the Michigan Law School was a selection index based on applicants composite LSAT score and undergraduate GPA. A 1992 policy statement however made an explicit commitment to racial and ethnic diversity seeking to enroll a critical mass of black Mexican American and Native American students. The objective was to enroll minority students in sufficient numbers to enable their participation in classroom discussions without feeling isolated or like spokesmen for their race. To foster a variety of perspectives and experiences admission officers consider a range of variables for example talents interests experiences and underrepresented minority status in their admissions decisions. In the course of each years admissions process the record showed minority admission rates were regularly reported to track the racial composition of the developing class. The 1992 policy replaced an earlier special admissions program which set a written goal of 1012 minority enrollment and lower academic requirements for those groups. The district court in Grutter made several key findings that there is a heavy emphasis on race in the law school admissions process that over a period of time 19921998 minorities ranged from 11 to 17 of each incoming class and that large numbers of minority students were admitted with index scores the same as or lower than unsuccessful white applicants. Writing for the Sixth Circuit majority Judge Martin adopted the Powell position in Bakke to find that the law school had a compelling interest in achieving a racially diverse student body and that its admissions policy was narrowly tailored to that end. The factors considered by the university were found to treat each applicant as an individual and to be virtually indistinguishable from plus factors and the Harvard Plan approved by Justice Powell in Bakke. Neither did the law schools policy reserve seats on the basis of race. Rather in pursuit of a critical mass the policy was designed to ensure that a meaningful number of minority students were able to contribute to classroom dialogue without feeling isolated. The majority opinion further emphasized that the admissions program was flexible with no fixed goal or target that it did not use separate tracks for minority and nonminority candidates and that it did not function as a quota system. Without waiting for a final appeals court decision the Supreme Court agreed to review the Gratz undergraduate admissions case in tandem with the Sixth Circuit ruling in Grutter. The Supreme Court handed down its rulings in Grutter and Gratz in 2003. Writing for the majority in the former was Justice OConnor who was joined by Justices Stevens Souter Ginsburg and Breyer in upholding the law school admissions policy. Chief Justice Rehnquist authored an opinion in which Justices OConnor Scalia Kennedy and Thomas joined striking down the universitys undergraduate racial admissions program. Justice Breyer added a sixth vote to invalidate the racial bonus system in Gratz but declined to join the majority opinion. A notable aspect of the Grutter majority opinion was the degree to which it echoed the Powell rationale from Bakke. Settling for the present the doctrinal imbroglio that had consumed so much recent lower court attention Justice OConnor quoted extensively from Justice Powells opinion finding it to be the touchstone for constitutional analysis of raceconscious admissions policies.47 But her opinion was not without its own possible doctrinal innovations. Overarching much of her reasoning were two paramount themes which drew considerable criticism from Justice Thomas and his fellow dissenters. First in applying strict scrutiny to the racial aspects of the law school admissions program Justice OConnor stressed the situational nature of constitutional interpretation. Thus the majority opined context matters when reviewing racebased governmental action for equal protection purposes and not every decision influenced by race is equally objectionable but may depend upon the importance and the sincerity of the reasons advanced by the governmental decisionmaker for that particular use of race.48 Second and equally significant was the deference accorded to the judgment of educational decisionmakers in defining the scope of their academic mission even in regard to matters of racial and ethnic diversity. Universities occupy a special niche in our constitutional tradition Justice OConnor stated such that the Law Schools educational judgment ... that diversity is essential to its educational mission is one to which we defer.49 Institutional good faith would thus be presumed in the absence of contrary evidence. However Justice Thomass dissent joined by Justice Scalia took particular exception to what he viewed as the fundamentally flawed proposition that racial discrimination can be contextualized deemed compelling for one purpose but not another or that strict scrutiny permits deference to the Law Schools conclusion that its racial experimentation leads to educational benefits.50 Indeed the dissenters found such deference to be antithetical to the level of searching review demanded by strict scrutiny. Satisfied that the law school had compelling reasons for pursuing a racially diverse student body the Court moved to the second phase of strict scrutiny analysis. Narrow tailoring as noted requires a close fit between means and end when the state draws any distinction based on race. In Grutter the concept of critical mass so troubling to several Justices at oral argument won the majoritys approval as necessary to further its compelling interest in securing the educational benefits of a diverse student body.51 In this portion of her opinion Justice OConnor drew chapter and verse from the standards articulated by Justice Powell in Bakke. We find that the Law Schools admissions program bears the hallmarks of a narrowly tailored plan. As Justice Powell made clear in Bakke truly individualized consideration demands that race be used in a flexible nonmechanical way. It follows from this mandate that universities cannot establish quotas for members of certain racial groups or put members of those groups on separate admissions tracks. Nor can universities insulate applicants who belong to certain racial or ethnic groups from the competition for admission. Universities can however consider race or ethnicity more flexibly as a plus factor in the context of individualized consideration of each and every applicant.52 Justice OConnor drew a key distinction between forbidden quotas and permitted goals exonerating the law schools admission program from constitutional jeopardy. She observed that both approaches pay attention to numbers but while the former are fixed and reserved exclusively for certain minority groups the opinion continued the law schools goal of attaining a critical mass of minority students required only a goodfaith effort by the institution. In addition Justice OConnor noted minority law school enrollment between 1993 and 2000 varied from 13.5 to 20.1 a range inconsistent with a quota.53 Responding in his separate dissent the Chief Justice objected that the notion of a critical mass was a subterfuge for racial balancing since it did not explain disparities in the proportion of the three minority groups admitted under its auspices. Other factors further persuaded the Court that the law school admissions process was narrowly tailored. By avoiding racial or ethnic bonuses the policy permitted consideration of all pertinent elements of diversity racial and nonracial in a highly individualized holistic review of each applicants file.54 Justice OConnor also found that race neutral alternatives had been sufficiently considered by the law school although few specific examples are provided. Importantly however the opinion made plain that exhaustion of every conceivable alternative is not constitutionally required only a serious good faith consideration of workable raceneutral alternatives that will achieve the diversity the university seeks.55 Consequently the law school was not required to consider a lottery or lowering of traditional academic benchmarks GPA and LSAT scores for all applicants since these alternatives would require a dramatic sacrifice of diversity the academic quality of all admitted students or both.56 And because the admissions program was based on individual assessment of all pertinent elements of diversity it did not unduly burden nonminority applicants. Nonetheless as she had during oral argument Justice OConnor emphasized the need for reasonable time limits and periodic reviews by institutions conducting such programs. To drive home the point the majority concludes with a general admonition. We expect that 25 years from now the use of racial preferences will no longer be necessary to further the interest approved today.57 Besides Justices Thomas and Scalia and the Chief Justice another dissenting opinion was filed by Justice Kennedy who agreed with his brethren that the consistency of minority admissions over a period of years raised a suspicion of racial balancing that the law school was required by the rigors of strict scrutiny to rebut. Arguing from different statistics than the majority he found little deviation among admitted minority students from 1995 to 1998 which fluctuated only by 0.3 from 13.5 to 13.8 and at no point fell below 12 historically defined by the Law School as the bottom of its critical mass range.58 In addition he contended the use of daily reports on minority admissions near the end of the process shifted the focus from individualized review of each applicant to institutional concerns for the numerical objective defined by a critical mass. For these reasons he agreed with his fellow dissenters that deference to the law school in this situation was antithetical to strict scrutiny not consistent with it.59 The four Grutter dissenters were joined by Justices OConner and Breyer in striking down the racial bonus system for undergraduate admissions in Gratz. Basically the same factors that saved the law school policy by their absence conspired to condemn the undergraduate program in the eyes of the majority. Since the universitys compelling interest in racial student diversity was settled in Grutter the companion case focused on the reasons why the automatic award of 20 admission points to minority applicants failed the narrow tailoring aspect of strict scrutiny analysis. Relying again on the Powell rationale in Bakke the policy was deemed more than a plus factor as it denied each applicant individualized consideration by making race decisive for virtually every minimally qualified underrepresented minority applicant.60 Nor did the procedure for flagging individual applications for additional review rescue the policy since such consideration is the exception and not the rule occurring if at all only after the bulk of admission decisions are made based on the point system.61 The opinion of the Chief Justice rejected the universitys argument based on administrative convenience that the volume of freshman applications makes it impractical to apply a more individualized review. The fact that the implementation of a program capable of providing individualized consideration might present administrative challenges does not render constitutional an otherwise problematic system.62 Finally the majority made plain that its constitutional holding in Gratz is fully applicable to private colleges and universities pursuant to the federal civil rights laws. We have explained that discrimination that violates the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment committed by an institution that accepts federal funds also constitutes a violation of Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.63 Justice OConnor concurring in Gratz emphasized the automatic nature of the selection index scoring which distinguished it from the law school program and made impossible any nuanced judgments concerning the background experiences or qualities of a given candidate. She agreed that the Admissions Review Committee appeared to be an afterthought particularly since the record was barren of evidence concerning its methods of operation and the decisionmaking process. Dissenting opinions were filed jointly by Justices Stevens and Souter and separately by Justice Ginsburg. The former argued on technical grounds that since the named petitioners had already enrolled in other schools and were not presently seeking freshman admission at the university they lacked standing to seek prospective relief and the appeal should be dismissed. But Justice Souter argued separately on the merits that the Michigan undergraduate admission program was sufficiently different from the racial quota in Bakke to be constitutionally acceptable. At the very least he felt a more appropriate course would be to remand the case for further development of the record to determine whether the entire admissions process including review by the Admissions Review Committee results in individualized review sufficient to meet the Courts standards.64 Meanwhile Justice Ginsburg would have found that the Michigan program was constitutional. In her view since only qualified applicants are admitted the current policy is not intended to limit admissions of any racial or ethnic group and admissions of nonminority groups are not unduly restricted. More broadly she opined that government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of inclusion and exclusion because the former are more likely to comport with constitutional imperatives of individual equality. At issue in Fisher was the constitutionality of the undergraduate admissions plan at the University of Texas at Austin UT which in a stated effort to increase diversity considers race as one factor among many when evaluating applicants to the school. The use of racial preferences in UT admissions has a complicated history. For many years UT admitted students based on a simple formula that considered students solely on the basis of academic achievement and race. In 1996 however the university was forced to abandon this admissions program in the wake of Hopwood v. Texas65 an appellate decision holding that Justice Powells opinion in Bakke was not controlling and that UTs raceconscious plan was unconstitutional.  After the Hopwood decision Texas adopted a new Top Ten Percent TTP plan which requires state universities to automatically admit any student who graduated from a state high school in the top 10 of his or her class. In general approximately 80 of each class was admitted under this approach while the remaining students were selected based on a number of raceneutral criteria measuring academic and personal achievement including essays leadership awards and honors work experience extracurricular activities community service and special circumstances such as socioeconomic status or family responsibilities. This raceneutral approach significantly increased minority enrollment at Texas universities although disparities remained within certain majors and classrooms. However in the wake of Grutter UT reintroduced race as a factor as part of the evaluation of personal achievement. Abigail Fisher a white student who did not qualify for admission under the TTP program sued claiming that she would have been admitted had race not been a factor and that the admissions program was therefore unconstitutional.66 The Fifth Circuit upheld UTs admissions plan67 but Fisher appealed and the Supreme Court agreed to review the case.68 Authored by Justice Kennedy the majority opinion in Fisher begins by emphasizing that its earlier precedents regarding affirmative action in higher education Bakke Grutter and Gratz remain valid.69 Collectively these cases stand for the proposition that the government may promote racial diversity in higher education as long as such programs can withstand strict scrutiny. The Court however ruled that the Fifth Circuit had not sufficiently scrutinized UTs admissions program and issued an order vacating and remanding the case to the lower court. Specifically the Court held that the Fifth Circuit had erred by applying an overly deferential form of strict scrutiny. According to the Court the appellate court was correct in finding that Grutter calls for deference when evaluating whether an institution has established a compelling governmental interest under the first prong of the strict scrutiny test.70 As a result the courts should generally defer to a universitys determination that racial diversity is essential to its educational goals. However the Fifth Circuit was similarly deferential to UTs assertion that its admissions program was narrowly tailored and this deference was improper ruled the Court.71 In particular the Court emphasized that UT bears the burden of proving that its admissions program is narrowly tailored to meet its diversity goal. For UT to meet this burden the reviewing court must ultimately be satisfied that no workable raceneutral alternative would produce the educational benefits of diversity.72 Because the Fifth Circuit relied on a deferential standard instead of conducting a more rigorous narrow tailoring inquiry the Court held that the lower court had not performed the proper strict scrutiny analysis. As a result the Court vacated the district courts decision and remanded the case to the Fifth Circuit for reconsideration under the correct standard. Justice Kennedy was joined in his opinion by Justices Roberts Scalia Thomas Breyer Alito and Sotomayor although Justices Scalia and Thomas filed separate concurring opinions in which both Justices stated that they would have voted to overrule Grutter.73 In a lone dissent Justice Ginsburg argued that programs such as UTs are constitutional and that supposedly raceneutral programs like UTs TTP plan are just as raceconscious as programs that explicitly take race into account.74 A little over a year after the Court issued its decision the Fifth Circuit issued a new verdict in the Fisher case. On remand the Fifth Circuit once again upheld UTs admissions plan despite applying the more demanding standard of review set forth by the Supreme Court. Specifically the Fifth Circuit concluded that UT had met this burden. According to the court UT Austins holistic review program a program nearly indistinguishable from the University of Michigan Law Schools program in Grutter was a necessary and enabling component of the Top Ten Percent Plan by allowing UT Austin to reach a pool of minority and nonminority students with records of personal achievement higher average test scores or other unique skills.75 After reviewing the data the court found that UTs use of race in pursuit of diversity is not about quotas or targets but about its focus upon individuals an opportunity denied by the Top Ten Percent Plan.76 As a result the court concluded that UTs limited use of race in admissions was narrowly tailored to meet the universitys diversity goals. In the wake of the appellate courts ruling the Supreme Court agreed once again to review the Fisher decision.77 Although the reason for the repeat grant of certiorari is uncertain the Courts decision to revisit the case appears to indicate some disagreement with the Fifth Circuits ruling. It is not clear however whether this apparent dissatisfaction is directed at the lower courts reasoning in the Fisher case specifically or at the constitutionality of such affirmative action programs more broadly. In 2013 the Court managed to avoid this larger question by issuing a narrow ruling that focused on the equal protection standard of review but at the time several of the Justices openly invited direct legal challenges to the use of race in higher education admissions. However until such a challenge is successfully mounted in Fisher or another case the limited use of raceconscious measures in higher education continues to remain constitutionally permissible for the time being. The Schuette case represents an interesting twist on the typical inquiry into the constitutionality of affirmative action programs. Unlike the challenges in Bakke GrutterGratz and Fisher which all questioned whether it is constitutionally permissible to promote racial diversity in higher education Schuette involved an inquiry as to whether it is constitutionally permissible to ban all consideration of race in the higher education context. In the wake of the 2003 rulings in the University of Michigan cases opponents of affirmative action in Michigan successfully lobbied for the passage of Proposal 2 which amended the Michigan state constitution to prohibit preferential treatment on the basis of race sex color ethnicity or national origin in public employment public education or public contracting. Opponents of Proposal 2 sued and a panel of judges on the Sixth Circuit ruled that Proposal 2s ban on racial preferences in public education violates the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution.78 This decision was subsequently upheld in a divided ruling by the full Sixth Circuit sitting en banc79 but the Supreme Court reversed the lower court.80 In the appellate ruling the majority opinion of the en banc Sixth Circuit relied extensively on two decadesold Supreme Court cases holding that an individuals ability to participate in the political process may not be disadvantaged on the basis of race. In Hunter v. Erikson81 local voters not only overturned an ordinance that prohibited housing discrimination but also amended the city charter to require that any housing laws that prohibit racial discrimination could not take effect unless approved by a majority of voters. In other words passage of regular housing laws required approval by the city council while passage of housing laws designed to protect racial minorities required an extra legislative step and was therefore more difficult to achieve. In invalidating the measure the Supreme Court held that this twotiered system placed special burdens on racial minorities within the governmental process and ruled that the state may not disadvantage any particular group by making it more difficult to enact legislation on its behalf.82 Likewise in Washington v. Seattle School District No. 183 the city enacted a student busing plan but voters adopted a constitutional amendment to prohibit local school boards from establishing such plans. The Court struck down the amendment noting that it imposed a disproportionate burden on the basis of race by requiring proponents of school busing laws to win support at a statewide level unlike other schoolrelated decisions that were approved by the local school board. According to the Court the equal protection clause prohibits a political structure that treats all individuals as equals yet more subtly distorts governmental processes in such a way as to place special burdens on the ability of minority groups to achieve beneficial legislation.84 Ultimately the Courts approach to these precedents was highly fractured. Although the Court upheld the Michigan law by a vote of 62 there were three different opinions concurring in the judgment. In an opinion announcing the judgment of the Court Justice Kennedy distinguished its rulings in cases such as Hunter and Seattle noting that these cases involved state laws that encouraged or inflicted injuries on racial minorities while Michigans Proposal 2 reflected the right of its voters to decide whether raceconscious preferences should continue to be used. In particular Justice Kennedy as well as other Justices appeared concerned about judicial interference in the political process and the viability of the political process doctrine itself. According to Justice Kennedy the Court lacks the authority to set aside Michigan laws that commit this policy determination about governmental use of racial preferences to the voters.85 In a concurring opinion Justice Scalia argued that the political process cases should be overturned entirely and that Proposal 2 should be upheld under the equal protection clause because it reflects no racially discriminatory purpose. Justice Breyer also wrote separately agreeing that Michigans law is constitutional. The Constitution permits but does not require racial preferences he wrote and voters not judges should be the ones to determine whether such programs should be implemented. Justice Sotomayor however strongly dissented from the Courts judgment. Detailing the nations long history of racial inequality she emphasized that race matters and urged her colleagues not to wish away ... the racial inequality that exists in our society.86 As the fractured ruling indicates the Court remains divided regarding the constitutionality of governmental actions that take race into account. For the moment though it appears that states are free to ban the use of racial preferences in public education and in other contexts such as public employment or contracting should they wish to do so. As a result the Schuette ruling could potentially result in a corresponding drop in minority enrollment at public colleges and universities located in such states as has already occurred in states such as California and Florida where similar bans were previously upheld.87 The use of affirmative action in public elementary and secondary school whether to eliminate the vestiges of racial segregation or to promote diversity has also been the subject of extensive judicial debate over the decades. Prior to 2007 the Supreme Court had never addressed the constitutionality of such programs leaving the analysis to the lower courts which were split on the issue. Indeed the majority of the federal appeals courts to review such cases after Grutter and Gratz were decided upheld the use of raceconscious measures in public schools88 but these opinions conflicted with preGrutterGratz appellate rulings that rejected such racially based plans.89 Two of these postGrutter cases are particularly significant. In MacFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools90 issued on the first anniversary of the Michigan decisions and the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education a federal district court in Kentucky upheld a Louisville districts voluntary consideration of race in making student assignments to achieve racial integration in the public schools. Jefferson County Public Schools JCPS were ordered by judicial decree to desegregate in 1975. Under the desegregation plan each school was to have between 15 and 50 African American enrollment and students were bused if necessary to ensure racial diversity. Twentyfive years later in 2000 the federal courts ended their supervision of the desegregation plan but the JCPS voluntarily opted to maintain its integrated schools through a managed choice plan. The plan was challenged in a lawsuit by black parents whose children were denied admission to Central High School which was already at the upper percentage limit for minority enrollment. The district court found that the managed choice plan served numerous compelling state interests some of the same reasons for integrated schools that the Supreme Court upheld in Grutter.91 Thus the court accepted the school boards arguments that the plan improved the educational experience that it produced educational benefits for students of all races over the last 25 years and that it helped overcome the adverse effects of concentrations of poverty that impact black students to a greater extent than whites. Integrated schools better academic performance appreciation for our diverse heritage and stronger more competitive public schools are consistent with the central values and themes of American culture92 reasoned the court. The decision also held that the student assignment plan was narrowly tailored in every respect except for its use of separate racial categories which the district was required to revise for the 20052006 school year. For reasons articulated in the wellreasoned opinion of the district court the Sixth Circuit summarily affirmed the decision without issuing a detailed written opinion.93 The constitutionality of raceconscious admissions to magnet or alternative schools designed to promote elementary and secondary school desegregation has also been before the courts. In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 194 the Ninth Circuit applied Grutter and Gratz to approve a school districts plan to maintain racially diverse schools. Under Seattles controlled choice high school student assignment plan students were given the option to attend high schools across the district but if the demand for seats exceeded the supply at a particular school a students race was considered as a tiebreaker in determining admittance to the oversubscribed school. The racial tiebreaker applied only to schools whose student bodies deviated by more than 15 percentage points from the overall racial makeup of the district then approximately 40 white and 60 nonwhite. The Seattle plan was voluntarily adopted to achieve diversity and limit racial isolation in the schools not as a part of a desegregation remedy. In an en banc decision the Ninth Circuit ruled that the school district had a compelling interest in the educational and social benefits of racial diversity and in avoiding racially concentrated or isolated schools. Further the court held that the districts plan was sufficiently narrowly tailored to pass constitutional muster. According to the court the individualized and holistic review endorsed by the Supreme Court was not required of a noncompetitive voluntary student assignment plan such as Seattles as long as the plan was otherwise narrowly tailored. The court held that Seattles plan was sufficiently narrowly tailored concluding that the 15 percentage point band was not a quota because it was flexible and did not reserve a certain number of fixed slots based on race. The court also ruled that the school district had made a good faith effort to consider raceneutral alternatives. Finally the court concluded that the plan imposed a minimal burden not being permitted to attend ones preferred school that was shared by all students and that the plan which was subject to regular reviews was sufficiently limited in time and in scope. The ruling reversed an earlier threejudge appellate panels contrary decision that the school districts plan to maintain racially diverse schools was not sufficiently narrowly tailored. Ultimately the Supreme Court granted review in MacFarland v. Jefferson County Public Schools now Meredith v. Jefferson County Board of Education and Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 to consider the question of what steps if any a public school district may take to maintain racial diversity in elementary and secondary education.95 In Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 a consolidated ruling that resolved both cases the Court struck down the school plans at issue holding that they violated the equal protection guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment.96 Ultimately the Supreme Court held that the Louisville and Seattle school plans violated the equal protection clause. However the decision was fractured with five different Justices filing opinions in the case. Announcing the judgment of the Court was Chief Justice Roberts who led a plurality of four Justices in concluding that the school plans were unconstitutional because they did not serve a compelling governmental interest. Although Justice Kennedy who concurred in the Courts judgment striking down the plans disagreed with the pluralitys conclusion that the diversity plans did not serve a compelling governmental interest he found that the school plans were unconstitutional because they were not narrowly tailored.97 In addition Justice Thomas filed a concurring opinion and Justices Stevens and Breyer filed separate dissenting opinions. In the portion of his opinion that was joined by Justice Kennedy and that therefore announced the judgment of the Court Chief Justice Roberts began by noting that the Court had jurisdiction in the case thereby rejecting a challenge to the standing of the plaintiff organization Parents Involved in Community Schools PICS.98 Chief Justice Roberts then turned to the substantive merits of the claims involved reiterating that governmental racial classifications must be reviewed under strict scrutiny. As a result the Court examined whether the school districts had demonstrated that their assignment and transfer plans were narrowly tailored to achieve a compelling governmental interest. In assessing the compelling interest prong of the strict scrutiny test Chief Justice Roberts noted that the Court has recognized two interests that qualify as compelling where the use of racial classifications in the school context is concerned remedying the effects of past intentional discrimination and promoting diversity in higher education.99 However the Chief Justice found that neither of these interests was advanced by the school plans at issue. According to the Chief Justice because Seattle schools were never intentionally segregated and because the lifting of its desegregation order demonstrated that Louisville schools had successfully remediated past discrimination in its schools neither school district could assert a compelling interest in remedying past intentional discrimination.100 Likewise the Court argued that the Grutter precedent did not govern the current cases. According to Chief Justice Roberts the compelling interest recognized in Grutter was in a broadly defined diversity that encompassed more than just racial diversity and that focused on each applicant as an individual.101 Because race was the only factor considered by the school districts rather than other factors that reflected a broader spectrum of diverse qualifications and characteristics and because the plans did not provide individualized review of applicants the plurality opinion found that the school districts articulated interest in diversity was not compelling. Added the Chief Justice even when it comes to race the plans here employ only a limited notion of diversity viewing race exclusively in whitenonwhite terms in Seattle and blackother terms in Jefferson County.102 In rejecting Grutter as applicable precedent the Court also noted that the decision had rested in part on the unique considerations of higher education and that those considerations were absent in the elementary and secondary education context.103 Even if the school districts had met the first prong of the strict scrutiny test by establishing a compelling governmental interest in the use of racial classifications to make school assignments the Court found the school plans would still have failed the second prong of the test because they were not sufficiently narrowly tailored to meet their stated goals. According to Chief Justice Roberts in both Seattle and Louisville only a few students were assigned to a nonpreferred school based on race. As a result the minimal impact of the districts racial classifications on school enrollment casts doubt on the necessity of using racial classifications104 especially in light of the fact that such racial classifications are permissible in only the most extreme circumstances. Additionally the Court was concerned that the school districts had failed to consider methods other than racial classifications to achieve their goals despite a requirement that narrowly tailored programs consider raceneutral alternatives. Although Justice Kennedy joined the above portions of the plurality opinion thereby forming a majority in favor of striking down the school plans he did not join the remainder of the plurality opinion which concluded for additional reasons that the school plans were unconstitutional.105 In these portions of his opinion Chief Justice Roberts faulted the school plans for tying their diversity goals to each districts specific racial demographics rather than to any pedagogical concept of the level of diversity needed to obtain the asserted educational benefits.106 In other words each district tried to establish schools with racial diversity that mirrored the percentages of racial groups in their respective overall populations. This effort according to the Chief Justice amounted to unconstitutional racial balancing because the plans were not in fact narrowly tailored to the goal of achieving the educational and social benefits that allegedly flow from racial diversity but rather were tailored to racial demographics instead. Indeed Chief Justice Roberts wrote accepting racial balancing as a compelling state interest would justify the imposition of racial proportionality throughout American society contrary to our repeated recognition that at the heart of the Constitutions guarantee of equal protection lies the simple command that the Government must treat citizens as individuals not as simply components of a racial religious sexual or national class.107 Such racial balancing could not in the Chief Justices view amount to a compelling governmental interest even if pursued in the name of racial diversity or racial integration. In another portion of the plurality opinion not joined by Justice Kennedy Chief Justice Roberts criticized Justice Breyers dissent for misapplying precedents that recognized a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination. According to the Chief Justice the Court has recognized a compelling interest in remedying past discrimination when that discrimination is caused by governmental action but not when caused by other factors such as social or economic pressures. Noting that the Seattle school district was never segregated due to state action and the Louisville school district had eliminated all vestiges of state segregation the Chief Justice therefore argued that the cases cited by Justice Breyer as precedents for raceconscious school integration efforts were inapplicable to the current case.108 The plurality opinion concluded with a discussion of Brown v. Board of Education109 in which the Court held that the deliberate segregation of schoolchildren by race was unconstitutional. According to the plurality Before Brown schoolchildren were told where they could and could not go to school based on the color of their skin. The school districts in these cases have not carried the heavy burden of demonstrating that we should allow this once again even for very different reasons.... The way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.110 Although he joined the Court in striking down the school plans Justice Kennedy wrote a separate concurring opinion that provides additional insight into how the Justices might handle future cases involving the consideration of race in the educational context. As noted above Justice Kennedy declined to sign on to the plurality opinion in full in part because he disagreed with its implication that diversity in elementary and secondary education at least as properly defined does not serve a compelling governmental interest. According to Justice Kennedy diversity depending on its meaning and definition is a compelling educational goal a school district may pursue111 but neither Seattle nor Louisville had shown that its plans served a compelling interest in promoting diversity or that the plans were narrowly tailored to achieve that goal. Justice Kennedy also pointedly criticized the plurality opinion for implying an alltoounyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when in my view it may be taken into account.... In the administration of public schools by the state and local authorities it is permissible to consider the racial makeup of schools and to adopt general policies to encourage a diverse student body one aspect of which is its racial composition.112 Justice Kennedy identified several ways in which schools in his view could constitutionally pursue racial diversity or avoid racial isolation including strategic site selection of new schools altering attendance zones providing resources for special programs and recruiting students and faculty.113 According to Justice Kennedy such measures would be constitutional because while raceconscious they are not based on classifications that treat individuals differently based on race. However Justice Kennedy would not limit schools to facially neutral methods of achieving diversity saying that racial classifications might be permissible if based on a more nuanced individual evaluation of school needs and student characteristics similar to the plan approved in Grutter.114 Although no other Justice joined his concurrence Justice Kennedys unique role in providing the pivotal swing vote in the case makes his concurring opinion significant to any future legal developments regarding the use of racial classifications in the education context. Although Justice Thomas joined the plurality opinion written by Chief Justice Roberts in full he also wrote a separate concurring opinion that took issue with certain aspects of Justice Breyers dissent. Among other things Justice Thomas disagreed with the dissents assertion that the school plans were necessary to combat school resegregation arguing that neither Seattle nor Louisville faced the type of intentional state action to separate the races that the school districts in Brown had.115 In addition Justice Thomas contested the dissents argument that a less strict standard of review should apply when racial classifications are used for benign purposes in part because Justice Thomas disagreed that the school plans which he wrote inevitably exclude some individuals based on race and therefore may exacerbate racial tension are as benign as the dissent asserted. More importantly Justice Thomas argued that the perception of what constitutes a benign use of raceconscious measures is nothing more than a reflection of current social practice that relies too heavily on the good intentions of current public officials. According to Justice Thomas if our history has taught us anything it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories adding in a footnote Justice Breyers good intentions which I do not doubt have the shelf life of Justice Breyers tenure.116 As noted above both Justices Stevens and Breyer dissented from the Courts decision to strike down the school plans. In his brief dissent Justice Stevens who also joined Justice Breyers dissent described the Courts reliance on Brown as a cruel irony because it ignored the historical context in which Brown was decided and the ways in which subsequent precedents applied the landmark decision to uphold school integration efforts.117 Meanwhile in a lengthy and passionate dissent nearly twice as long as Chief Justice Robertss opinion Justice Breyer argued that the Courts holding distorts precedent ... misapplies the relevant constitutional principles ... announces legal rules that will obstruct efforts by state and local governments to deal effectively with the growing resegregation of public schools ... threatens to substitute for present calm a disruptive round of racerelated litigation and ... undermines Browns promise of integrated primary and secondary education that local communities have sought to make a reality.118 The Michigan cases resolved an issue that had vexed the lower federal courts for a quartercentury. Historically judicial insistence on strict scrutiny has largely condemned governmental distinctions based on race except in the most narrowly circumscribed circumstances. To the short list of governmental interests sufficiently compelling to warrant racebased decisionmaking a majority of the Court added the pursuit of diversity in higher education. But this expansion has been curtailed somewhat by the Courts more recent pronouncement involving elementary and secondary school plans to promote racial diversity its less deferential approach in Fisher and its subsequent decision to reconsider UTs admissions plan during the upcoming term. Although the Courts decision to strike down the Seattle and Louisville school assignment and transfer plans likely had a profound impact on similar plans at many of the nations elementary and secondary schools the Parents Involved in Community Schools case did not completely foreclose the possibility that school districts may constitutionally pursue certain measures to avoid racial isolation prevent resegregation and promote racial diversity in their schools. However it is not entirely clear what these measures might entail. While the facially raceneutral methods identified in Justice Kennedys concurring opinion such as engaging in strategic site selection of new schools altering attendance zones providing resources for special programs and recruiting students and faculty seem more likely to survive judicial scrutiny the fate of other kinds of raceconscious school plans may become apparent only as a result of legal developments that emerge over time. Indeed there is evidence that some school districts are abandoning racebased school assignment plans in favor of plans based on socioeconomic status which is a nonsuspect classification for purposes of constitutional review.119 Likewise some colleges and universities have taken similar steps in anticipation of judicial rulings limiting the use of race in higher education.120 Meanwhile the seeds of future controversy may lie in questions arguably raised but not fully addressed by the latest rulings. For example the Courts latest rulings left unanswered the constitutional status of racially exclusive diversity policies not directly involving admissions such as the legality of racebased scholarship and financial aid recruitment and outreach or college preparation courses that exclusively target minority populations. In addition the question of whether schools or universities may completely avoid constitutional shoals by adopting raceneutral plans to increase racial diversity may not be fully answered by the Courts latest rulings. Such raceneutral alternatives include percentage plans like those approved in Texas Florida and California that guarantee college admission to top graduates from every state high school regardless of race. In addition to percentage plans educational authorities have experimented with other forms of alternative action or policies designed to promote racial diversity without relying on racial preferences. Classbased affirmative action for example takes socioeconomic status or the family educational background of students into account. Such strategies may include replacing race and ethnicity with other socioeconomic and geographical proxies for diversity increasing needbased financial aid programs improving lowperforming primary and secondary schools providing additional educational services at such schools and considering diversity or hardship essays in which applicants describe challenging life experiences such as poverty English as a second language or having a family member in prison.  By avoiding the use of explicit racial classifications and dualtrack admission policies these efforts are far less susceptible to facial challenge as an equal protection violation. Programs involving the explicit consideration of race remain most at risk. But policies that employ nonracial factors as a proxy for race may be vulnerable if the purpose or intent is to benefit minority groups. In Washington v. Davis121 and related rulings122 the Supreme Court determined that a raceneutral law with a disparate racial impact on minority groups is subject to strict scrutiny if it is enacted with a racially discriminatory purpose. Racial motive was made a constitutional touchstone for equal protection analysis and whether reflected by a racial classification or other evidence of discriminatory purpose strict scrutiny was triggered by evidence of such intent. Similarly alternatives to traditional racial diversity policies may not escape strict judicial scrutiny if an objecting nonminority applicant is able to show that the plan was racially motivated. The same limitations may apply to private institutions which are immune from constitutional limitations under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Beyond education issues may inevitably arise concerning the implications of Grutter Parents Involved in Community Schools and Fisher on efforts to achieve racial diversity in other social and economic spheres. To date the Court has permitted raceconscious hiring criteria by private employers under Title VII either as a remedy for past discrimination or to redress a conspicuous racial imbalance in traditionally segregated job categories123 but refused to find that a states interest in faculty diversity to provide teacher role models was sufficiently compelling to warrant a raceconscious layoff policy.124 Lower courts are similarly divided though a few have applied an operational need analysis to uphold police force diversity policies recognizing that a law enforcement bodys need to carry out its mission effectively with a workforce that appears unbiased is able to communicate with the public and is respected by the community it serves may constitute a compelling state interest.125 But current standards under the federal civil rights laws generally allow for consideration of race in hiring and promotion decisions only in response to demonstrable evidence of past discrimination by the employer or within the affected industry. No rule of deference like that extended to educational institutions has been recognized for employers nor is one likely to be applied in the wake of Parents Involved in Community Schools or Fisher.

https://www.npr.org/2023/06/29/1176715957/why-the-supreme-court-decision-on-affirmative-action-matters,  Enlarge this image Peter Judson for NPR Peter Judson for NPR The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday rejected raceconscious admissions in higher education at Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill overturning more than 40 years of legal precedent. The ruling in the two cases hands opponents of affirmative action a major victory. The opinion written by Chief Justice John Roberts found that the admissions programs at both universities violated the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment. However wellintentioned the policies at UNC and Harvard were Roberts wrote the universities failed to use them within the confines of the narrow restrictions that previous court rulings had allowed. Roberts also wrote that schools could still consider an applicants discussion of how race affected his or her life be it through discrimination inspiration or otherwise. But not he wrote through a specific application essay or other means. This is a very strident curtailing of the ability to use raceconscious admissions policies says Dominique Baker a professor of education policy at Southern Methodist University. This is bad. But its important to pay attention to the details because those details are how we think about what institutions can do right now at the moment as theyre gearing up to start working on admissions for the next year. In the Harvard case the court considered whether the school discriminated against Asian American students in the admissions process. With UNC the court considered whether the school was using raceconscious admissions in an appropriately limited manner. The conservative activist group Students for Fair Admissions SFFA was behind both the Harvard and the UNC cases. There are nearly 4000 colleges and universities in the U.S. and only a small portion slightly more than 200 have highly selective admissions where fewer than 50 of applicants get in. Thats just over 200 schools where the ruling on a raceconscious admissions process could make a significant difference. And yet despite how few students these policies would actually affect what happens at these elite institutions matters. They remain a key gatekeeper to access at high levels of government and industry. As just one example currently eight of the nine Supreme Court justices attended law school at Harvard or Yale. In the simulations removing race and relying on different combinations of high school grades test scores or socialeconomic indicators did not yield more ethnically diverse classes. Zack Mabel a professor of education and economics at Georgetown and an author on the research explained the findings like this It boils down to The more information that you are able to consider about the educational opportunities and disadvantages that an individual has had in their life the better you as an admissions officer are going to be at understanding who is going to be a qualified applicant. Mabel says current admissions criteria reinforce disparities in educational opportunity that exist in the K12 system and that research has shown that at highly selective colleges students admitted with lower grades and scores are just as likely to succeed as the rest of their classmates. This echoes previous research conducted in several states that have banned raceconscious admissions from ballot measures. Those statewide bans include Michigan since 2006 California since 1996 and reaffirmed in 2020 and Washington since 1998 and reaffirmed in 2019. Experts say the courts new decision could have implications beyond just admissions. We have to think beyond just the whogetsin and whogetstoenroll piece says Baker at Southern Methodist University. The ruling could affect financial aid decisions including targeted scholarships and efforts by campuses to create communities of students from diverse backgrounds. She wonders for example whether a program designed to increase the number of Black doctors with support to complete the premed curriculum and get into medical school will now be challenged. Todays ruling he says may have a much broader sweep in fact than just with admissions. OiYan Poon a visiting education professor at the University of Maryland College Park points to early court filings from the plaintiffs in the Harvard case arguing to end any use of race or ethnicity in the educational setting not just in admissions. But Liliana Garces a professor of education at the University of Texas at Austin maintains that Thursdays opinion is limited to race in college admissions and nothing else. The only legal issue that was before the court was the consideration of race in admissions. She says its now up to universities to implement the ruling in their practices and policies. But she believes this decision does not explicitly prohibit raceconscious decisions in other areas such as financial aid. Itll be important for institutions to hold their ground and be able to engage in those other practices that are absolutely foundational to their mission. Baker agrees We want to make sure that we dont overstate what the legal contours are because that might create a chilling effect where institutions restrict themselves further than the legal limits. Shes especially interested in the line in Justice Roberts majority opinion about how schools can still consider the way race impacted an applicants life. That tells me that there are some pathways forward Baker says. But are those pathways forward the most effective ways of trying to achieve more racial equity within college admissions? No. After California banned raceconscious admissions in 1996 the proportions of Black and Latino students at UCLA one of the most highly selective schools in the states system fell drastically. By 2006 a decade later only 96 Black students enrolled in a freshman class of nearly 5000. They became known as the Infamous 96. The University of California responded to those numbers by recrafting its admissions policies to take a more holistic approach considering several factors including whether students were the first in their family to go to college what high school they went to and their familys income. The university has spent more than 20 years and hundreds of millions of dollars in new programs and scholarships in efforts to restore that level of diversity. Other ideas for promoting campus diversity include admitting a percentage of the states high school students like the University of Texas at Austin which automatically admits Texas students in the top 6 of their high school graduating class. Lotteries have also been proposed where eligible students with high qualifications would be randomly selected for acceptance. Nothing is as good at helping to enroll a more racially equitable class than using race. Nothing comes close to it says Baker. There are other tools other ideas. But if race is not taken into consideration those different types of techniques and tools do not replicate what raceconscious admissions policies do. This opinion comes less than a decade since the last time the high court ruled on affirmative action. In Fisher v. University of Texas in 2016 the court ruled that colleges could consider race in admissions.  The two cases the court ruled on Thursday are Students for Fair Admission v. Harvard and Students for Fair Admission v. University of North Carolina. While very similar the cases represent two very different admissions environments UNC is a state school that highly favors instate students its only allowed to admit 18 of firstyear students from out of state while Harvard is a highly selective private school that admits fewer than 5 of all applicants thats just under 2000 students this fall. In amicus briefs filed with the Supreme Court ahead of the arguments in these two cases the University of Michigan and the University of California Berkeley both admitted that their efforts to meet their diversity goals without using race were falling short. But not every school says it is struggling to achieve diversity without raceconscious admissions. The attorney general of Oklahoma filed a brief on behalf of several states in support of the plaintiffs in the two cases The University of Oklahoma for example remains just as diverse today if not more so than it was when Oklahoma banned affirmative action in 2012. The universitys main campus in Norman currently has a U.S. undergraduate student population that is about 60 white and 5 Black. In the absence of race in the admissions process Kelly Slay an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University who studies affirmative action expects to see colleges increase targeted recruitment expand financial aid including freecollege programs and go testoptional in an effort to maintain their ethnic and racial diversity. But she says we dont have anything that works as effectively at producing and enhancing racial diversity as raceconscious affirmative action. We have over 20 years of data and research on that.

Credit Will Kirk Johns Hopkins University ByEmily Gaines Buchler Some members of Congress might resort to namecalling and near fistfighting to resolve problems but the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Agora Institute at Johns Hopkins University wants to model another way dialogue and debate. On Nov. 15 more than 170 students faculty and members of the public came together for a nighttime debate among experts on whether the United States still needs racebased affirmative action. The event follows the U.S. Supreme Courts landmark ruling this past summer in lawsuits against Harvard University and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. In a 63 vote the Supreme Court overturned four decades of precedence by declaring affirmative action policies unconstitutional specifically a violation of the 14th Amendments equal protection clause barring racial discrimination. Yet the decision left colleges across the country with little guidance on how to shift practices after years of relying on affirmative action to bolster diversity on campuses. Hosted by SNF Agora the debate was part of the Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium a studentrun lecture series established in 1967 to bring noted speakers to Johns Hopkins to analyze important issues in fresh incisive and at times unsettling ways. Two students played a key role in selecting the topic and speakers Spriha Thapa a junior majoring in cellular and molecular biology and Samhi Bopanna a junior doublemajoring in political science and biology. We started working on the event right after the Supreme Court released their ruling and both Spriha and Samhi knew the topic would be top of mind for fellow students and perfectly suited for a debate format said Louise Flavahan who spearheaded the event and is the director of dialogue and debate at SNF Agora. The question of why now and why here at Johns Hopkins feels more pressing and important than ever in the midst of global and domestic conflicts Flavahan said. As a university we need to be able to speak and perhaps more importantly listen to one another about challenging difficult and sometimes seemingly intractable problems if we have any hope of solving them. The debate took place in Shriver Hall with two scholars in support of racebased affirmative action contending with two scholars who consider it unconstitutional. On the supportive side were Natasha Warikoo a sociology professor at Tufts University and author of two recent books Is Affirmative Action Fair? The Myth of Equity in College Admissions and Race at the Top Asian Americans and Whites in Pursuit of the American Dream in Suburban Schools and Jonathan Feingold an associate professor of law at Boston University and host of the podcast RaceClass. Arguing against the continued use of affirmative action and in support of the Supreme Courts ruling were Richard Kahlenberg an economist and public policy scholar at Georgetown University who wrote among other books The Remedy and Tough Liberal and Mike Gonzalez a senior fellow at The Heritage Foundation and author of most recently BLM The Making of a New Marxist Revolution. Stephanie Shonekan dean of the College of Arts and Humanities at the University of Maryland moderated the debate. Im deeply skeptical of debates because I think they privilege a sort of rhetorical jousting and an illusion of engagement that I think doesnt help us solve problems Feingold said in his opening statement. He urged the debaters and audience to use the acronym LEEP as a framework for discussing racebased admissions to avoid talking past each other he said. In LEEP he told the audience the L stands for the law Is the policy legal? while the two Es stand for empirical and ethical Is the policy based on empirical evidence? Is it ethical? and the P stands for practical Given what we know should we implement the policy? Is it practical?. Despite what people think only about 200 to 300 selective colleges out of 4004 colleges nationwide used affirmative action Warikoo said in her opening statement. Although many believe the policy utilizes racial quotas to make the percentages of underrepresented minorities on campus mirror the broader society that isnt the case. Racial quotas were banned by the Supreme Court decades ago she explained. Another misconception Affirmative action benefits minority students only. Not so Warikoo argued. Studies show that it leads to more positive racial attitudes intellectual engagement and civic engagement for all students. Gonzalez on the dissenting side argued that America in the 21st century should be embarrassed when we make decisions based on race. He went on to compare affirmative action to the historic 1896 case Plessy v. Ferguson when the Supreme Court upheld statemandated segregation laws. Plessy was the low point of the courts history Gonzalez said adding that the court overturned Plessy with its 1954 ruling on Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka making racial segregation illegal. Continuing to use race as a factor in college admissions can hurt diligent and eager students Gonzalez claimed. Theres the student who works really hard to get a good SAT and a really stellar GPA but then doesnt get into her schools of choice because of race that is a gross harm done to her he said. But even worse is the student who on the day she gets her letter of admission supposedly the happiest day of her life she has this suspicion she was admitted not because of her achievements but because of her race. She has to live with that stigma the rest of her life. Kahlenberg meanwhile took issue with universities using affirmative action in ways it wasnt intended. Rather than doing the hard work of reaching out to economically disadvantaged students of all races some elite schools like Harvard bring together fairly wealthy students of all races which is better than all white students but still not true diversity Kahlenberg said. Harvard has a student body that is majority minority which is something to celebrate but it also has 15 times as many rich students as lowincome students which is something to be ashamed of. Kahlenberg went on to weave in the work of Martin Luther King Jr. who proposed a bill of rights for economically disadvantaged people of all races and believed that including poor white people in the program was a simple matter of justice. When asked what makes this moment in U.S. history the right or wrong time to end affirmative action Feingold pointed to the changes that occurred on the Supreme Court under the Trump administration. The reason this happened now was because Donald Trump had an opportunity to dramatically shift the ideological consistencies of the Court in 2016 Feingold said referring to the three justices Trump appointed Neil Gorsuch Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett who voted to abolish affirmative action once and for all. Warikoo during her allotted time said the moment to end affirmative action has not arrived yet because race and class still influence how people live in the U.S. When you compare a poor or workingclass Black family with a poor or workingclass white family data shows that they often live in different kinds of neighborhoods she said. The white family is more likely to live in a more mixedincome neighborhood and go to schools with higher levels of academic achievement than poor Black kids she said. Similarly Warikoo maintained Black families have had fewer years to save money and accumulate wealth than white families. This in turn contributes to a median household wealth among Black families that is 15 that of white families which makes a big difference in putting a down payment on a house she said. Thats why we need both race and class consideration in college admissions. Mala MalhotraOrtiz an attorney and adjunct law professor at the University of Maryland served as the evenings dispute resolution expert charged with advancing the conversation and finding shared goals and opinions among debaters. Theres a common belief among all of you that race does matter and that you want to celebrate minorities MalhotraOrtiz said. Yet theres an assumption here that going to Harvard or North Carolina or some other university might somehow give you more power. Maybe thats true that is the assumption but remember that some people who dropped out became famous wealthy and powerful. Some of you talked a bit about authentic equity as opposed to this checkthebox exercise of a quota or counting marbles and so on she continued. Using affirmative action as a way to actually gauge where we are versus guide us on where to be thats a difference and a nuance that I think you are all coming to or that you might agree to use as a gauge for the question Are we being fair? In her closing statement Warikoo picked up and elaborated on MalhotraOrtizs comment about the status and power associated with certain schools. Part of this debate about college admissions is because we are so focused on a very small number of elite colleges and these colleges have not expanded to make room for the many amazing young people in our country she said. There are going to be winners and losers and its tragic that these universities are admitting such a small percentage of students who apply Warikoo said. She urged the U.S. to move on from debating who deserves a spot in a selective university and who doesnt and from saying one person is better simply because a highranking institution admitted them this is a fruitless and problematic conversation leading to behaviors like parents putting stickers on their cars and saying My child is so amazing. Instead she contended we need to recognize that our society as it exists now is full of inequities and that everyone who wants and seeks a worldclass education deserves a shot.

Getty imagesskynesherJun 16 2023Jade McClainJun 16 2023 Education and Social SciencesLaw and PolicySteinhardt School of Culture Education and Human Development As the country awaits the US Supreme Court ruling in the affirmative action cases against the University of North Carolina and Harvard University experts suggest that the decision is likely to have a significant impact on college admissions. Analysis of the anticipated outcome has also led to broader questions about diversity and inclusion efforts on campus barriers that prevent many BIPOC students from attending college and stereotypes and prejudices that these court cases may perpetuate. For insight into the nuances of how the Court s ruling may impact universities and prospective students NYU News spoke to Steinhardt professors Mike Hoa Nguyen and Lisa Stulberg. Nguyen coauthored an amicus brief filed on behalf of academics and social scientists in the Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard case that presented empirical research regarding the educational experiences of Asian American students and called for the use of affirmative action in college admissions to be affirmed. Stulberg has written extensively on affirmative action and race and education and authored Diversity in American Higher Education Toward a More Comprehensive Approach Routledge 2011. She is currently cowriting with Anthony S. Chen of Northwestern University a book outlining the origins and political development of raceconscious affirmative action in college admissions. What claims do these cases make about Asian American students and other students of color? Stulberg The two cases are a bit different here. The case that Students for Fair Admissions or SFFA brought against the University of North Carolina does not make any claims about how Asian American students are impacted by UNC s admissions policies and practices. Only in the Harvard case is there a claim that admissions discriminates against Asian Americans. There are a few important things to keep in mind. First the claim about Asian Americans in the Harvard case has been made in a topdown way by SFFA and its president Ed Blum. There is no individual Asian American plaintiff who has come forward because they feel they were personally discriminated against in the Harvard admissions process. It s also important to note that the lower court ruling in the Harvard case found no evidence of discrimination against Asian Americans and the appellate court upheld this ruling.Nguyen SFFA in the Harvard case makes several claims that leverage harmful racial stereotypes about Asian American students and in doing so ignores major differences among the diverse and complex educational experiences of Asian Americans. For example they argue that Asian American students are substantially stronger than other demographic groups on nearly every measure of academic achievement including SAT scores and GPA. This inaccurate assumption is fundamentally flawed and reinforces the model minority myth where Asian Americans are perceived to be higher achieving and value education more than other racial groups especially those of minoritized identities. And it is this myth that disregards social historical and public policy factors that can drive academic achievement for some Asian Americans while completely ignoring the educational challenges faced by other Asian Americans such as Southeast Asian Americans and for other students of color.  Additionally some opponents of affirmative action promote an inaccurate notion that Asian Americans students must score higher than other students to get accepted into a highly selective institution. However tests like the SAT are imperfect measures of merit and are often more associated with one s parental educational attainment levels and socioeconomic status rather than college success. Yet there is a persistent claim that Asian Americans must score considerably higher on these tests. This claim is based upon a study that uses data that is nearly three decades old and does not account for the many other factors used in college admissions such as essays and letters of recommendation. In fact even the study s lead author Thomas Espenshade has cautioned readers to not overinterpret the findings or that it establishes racial bias. How have these cases shaped public opinion of affirmative action? What should the public know? Stulberg I m not sure of the impact of the cases themselves on public opinion. But more broadly despite the claim by those who oppose raceconscious affirmative action that affirmative action is wildly unpopular that s just not true. Recent data are mixed on the extent to which Americans support a small affirmative consideration of race in admissions. There is some evidence from a 2022 Pew study that the majority of Americans do not favor taking race into consideration in college admissions though this depends on the way that the question is worded by pollsters. On the other hand a Gallup Poll conducted in 2021 found that 62 percent of Americans support affirmative action programs. This was the highest level of support since 2001 though it s not clear from the question whether respondents were considering programs in employment or education. And most recently in May 2023 an APNORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that most oppose banning the consideration of race and ethnicity in college and university admissions. The poll found that when asked directly about the upcoming Supreme Court decision 63 percent of respondents said that the Supreme Court should not prohibit the consideration of race and ethnicity in admissions. Nguyen Perhaps this is due to the patchwork of how affirmative action is practiced and not practiced across the country and how it is legally permissible in some states and banned in others. Additionally not all polling is created equal. How the question is asked and what context is given greatly impacts how respondents may feel about affirmative action and shape their understanding of how affirmative action was historically practiced compared to how it is practiced today why affirmative action exists and how that has changed over time and what is legally permissible and how that has changed from Bakke to Fisher. Nonetheless scholars from AAPI Data found that 69 percent of Asian American voters when asked in English as well as in their Asian language supported affirmative action in college admissions.  What are your biggest concerns about a ruling overturning affirmative action in college admissions? Stulberg I would say that I have two primary concerns. The first is that colleges and universities are going to go farther than they need to go legally to respond to a Supreme Court decision. It s very important to remember that the Harvard and UNC cases are about the consideration of race in admissions not in education programming or other efforts related to diversity equity inclusion and belonging on campus. I m afraid that educational institutions will begin to roll back other programs and initiatives designed to support students and support student diversity even though the cases are about admissions only not broadly about whether race can ever be used as a way to organize educational supports or experiences. Secondly I am quite worried about how a ruling to overturn raceconscious admissions will impact the representation of Black and Latinx students especially at selective colleges. The social science evidence and what we know from the states that have legally had to implement admissions plans that do not consider race is that there is no raceneutral alternative to raceconscious affirmative action. No supposedlyraceneutral or economicfocused policy will produce the same level of racial and ethnic diversity that a positive attention to race does. So we need to be able to employ raceconscious affirmative action in admissions if we want to benefit from the rich diverse classroom and campus experiences that so many of us value about higher education. Nguyen There is a wide range of potential outcomes that can result from the Court s decision for both cases. On one end the Court can uphold Grutter where race can be used as one of many factors in college admissions. On the other end it can completely restrict the use of race in admissions. Or the Court can offer one of many different rulings that rests in between these two poles. However if the Court does rule against 45 years of legal precedent where the consideration of race in college admissions can no longer be used to build a diverse cohort of students in which the educational benefits of diversity flow there will be a devastating negative effect in college admissions for students of color including Asian Americans. Regardless of the Court s ruling colleges and universities must maintain their moral and legal obligations to promote educational equity access opportunity and success for students of color. And in doing so must take proactive steps across a wide selection of tools to ensure these outcomes. What factors should universities consider in determining how they respond if affirmative action is affirmed or struck down? Nguyen Colleges and universities irrespective of the Court s decision should promote policies and practices that widen educational opportunity and work towards eliminating racial inequality in higher education. This means focusing on initiatives that improve campus racial climate and develop a greater sense of belonging for students of color through academic cocurricular and research opportunities among many others. These campusbased actions should be designed in a manner that promotes students full selves. Additionally colleges and universities must continue and expand outreach and implement initiatives in and with underserved communities to develop and expand pipelines and preparation for higher education. Stulberg As I ve said it s important for colleges and universities to keep in mind that the Harvard and UNC cases are about the consideration of race in admissions only not in education programming more broadly. I suppose the Supreme Court could go beyond the questions that are before it and issue a very broad ruling here but the cases that are presented to the Court are about admissions only. So I hope that higher ed administrators will not take it upon themselves to roll back programming that works to recruit and support students of color on campus. The reality is that affirmative action taking race into consideration a small amount in admissions is not going to solve educational injustice and inequality in this country. There are much broader institutional and political educational challenges to racial equity that higher education and its policies can t solve. But there are some things that colleges and universities could do to more broadly impact access to educational opportunity even if they don t have raceconscious affirmative action as a tool in the near future. To focus broadly on educational access and equity civil rights and education policy groups have proposed ending early decision practices in admission ending legacy admission and preference for children of donors challenging merit aid while providing more needbased aid going testfree and eliminating the consideration of AP coursetaking in the admissions process. These will not be politically easy changes but colleges and universities with a commitment to educational equity should consider them.
https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/future-college-admissions-without-affirmative-action, The US Supreme Court s upcoming affirmative action decision which many legal experts expect will limit or end the consideration of an applicant s race in college admissions would likely immediately hinder college and universities ability to maintain let alone increase the racial and ethnic diversity of their student bodies. Research on schools in states that have eliminated affirmative action suggests no other single admissions policy will produce current levels of racial and ethnic diversity on its own. What admissions policies have been enacted in states where affirmative action has already been banned? And what effect have those policies had on student racial diversity? In states that have eliminated affirmative action studies have consistently found declines in the admission and enrollment of Black Latinx and Indigenous people. These declines are especially concentrated in selective and flagship institutions. Evidence shows diversity in higher education improves learning outcomes for all students and the benefits extend beyond graduation. A ban could not only negatively affect students of color who would be less likely to attend selective institutions that usually have more resources and higher graduation rates but could also prevent other students at these universities from benefiting from the perspectives and experiences that having a more diverse class brings. Simulations that measure the consequences of banning affirmative action and the effectiveness of raceneutral policies find that although alternatives may mitigate the effects of the ban they will not fully make up for the loss of racial diversity on their own. However if the use of race is prohibited in college admissions the following approaches would likely be most adopted. A frequently discussed raceneutral admissions policy is a classbased admissions practice. Under this approach greater weight is given to applicants from less affluent socioeconomic backgrounds to recognize those students may not have had the same resources and educational opportunities as wealthier students. Black and Latinx households have disproportionally lower incomes because of structural barriers so applying a greater weight to an applicant s income status theoretically could produce a more racially diverse cohort of students.Multiple statistical models of this approach found absent other changes to the current admissions process classbased admissions on its own would not provide similar levels of diversity as racebased admissions. In its amicus brief the University of Michigan went a step further saying classbased admissions don t increase racial diversity and using it as the sole means to increase nonwhite enrollment can exacerbate stereotypes rather than alleviating them. PDFBecause there are more white people with low incomes than racially underrepresented people with low incomes and because people of color with low incomes also face systemic racism that further disadvantages them in the education system classbased affirmative action would likely not lead to racial diversity at the same levels as racebased affirmative action. After affirmative action was banned in California Texas and Florida each state implemented percentage plans PDF under which a certain percentage of the top students from a high school s graduating class would receive automatic admission to state universities. Texas s percentage plan developed by a special task force of the state legislature was adopted to combat the effects of the Hopwood ruling on diversity PDF. The idea was that by admitting students from various high schools around the state the state s universities would be more representative of Texas s population leading to greater diversity.Although these policies helped increase diversity at some schools they were less effective than racebased admissions policies in increasing Black and Latinx student enrollment because of Black and Latinx underrepresentation in the top percentages of high school classes and the fact that many of the racially underrepresented students at the top of their classes likely would have been admitted without the automatic admission plan.Additionally in Texas studies show that rebounds in the amount of racially or ethnically underrepresented students at state universities after the elimination of affirmative action are more attributable to the large increases of Latinx and Black people in the overall population than the state s top percentage plan. Data show application rates of underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to selective institutions are not representative of their state s demographic composition. These students of color with similar qualifications as white students are also less likely to apply to moreselective schools even when eligible for automatic admission.Increased recruitment in areas with greater racial diversity can help inform prospective students about the application process and encourage them to apply but may not offset declines that occurred after affirmative action bans alone.For example Texas A M and the University of Texas at Austin created partnership programs with underrepresented schools to recruit and provide financial aid and support to a select number of students. But even with this program and automated admission those eligible for the scholarships and the top percentage plan were still less likely to enroll in these more selective universities relative to other high school students. The systemic exclusion of students of color from higher education means white students benefit most from legacy preferences in admissions. Many highly selective schools admit more legacy students than Black and Latinx applicants and the rate of admission for legacies is more than three times higher than for nonlegacy applicants.Ending legacy admissions could help make the higher education admission process more equitable. When Johns Hopkins University eliminated legacy preferences in 2014 the percentage of firstgeneration students increased by approximately 10 percent and the percentage of Pelleligible students increased by about 7 percent between 2013 and 2021. Though standardized tests for college admission are often found to benefit wealthy white students most research on the role of testoptional policies in increasing the racial diversity of applicants is inconclusive. However a study on the institutions that adopted the policy found the percentage of Black Latinx and Indigenous students and the percentage of Pelleligible students increased slightly at testoptional institutions compared with similar schools that still required SAT or ACT scores. Making tests optional or eliminating them could help selective institutions remove one barrier to students of color applying and being admitted. Research suggests colleges and universities particularly selective ones would experience a decrease in racial and ethnic diversity among their students if the Supreme Court ends racebased affirmative action because no single raceneutral admission policy has the same effect as raceconscious admissions. If overturned returning to current diversity levels would require a commitment to adopting a combination of the strategies above innovating these strategies or developing new ones. In the meantime better national data on the admissions process will be critical to understanding the effectiveness of raceneutral policies.

https://www.epi.org/blog/the-supreme-courts-ban-on-affirmative-action-means-colleges-will-struggle-to-meet-goals-of-diversity-and-equal-opportunity/, After extensive deliberation the Supreme Court has delivered a landmark ruling that effectively prohibits the use of racebased affirmative action in college admissions. Raceblind admissions processes will further exacerbate existing inequalities and undermine the recognition of the unique challenges that Black Hispanic and Native American students encounter throughout the admissions process. By disregarding the significance of race these approaches risk creating a wider divide between equal opportunity and communities of color.  This decision marks a significant setback for colleges which have relied on this tool for over 40 years to enhance racial diversity on their campuses and compensate for decades of both explicit and implicit racebased exclusion. Colleges must now explore options like targeted recruitment programs and using other metrics such as household income and wealth as substitutes for racebased admissions. However flagship schools from states that previously banned affirmative action and used these alternative tactics have a poor track record of success in achieving meaningful diversity gains in their student body without using affirmative action.  Over the years a total of nine states have implemented bans on affirmative action. This policy shift forced top educational institutions like the University of California and the University of Michigan to abandon racebased admissions and find new ways to admit diverse student bodies. As a result these universities made significant efforts to foster racial diversity by investing hundreds of millions of dollars in outreach programs. However according to two amicus briefs in support of affirmative action filed by these two universities last year to the Supreme Court these endeavors have proven to be ineffective. Both university systems revealed perpetually low enrollment rates among students of color despite their significant investment in alternative ways to boost diversity among the applicant pool and student body. Following California s implementation of Proposition 209 in 1996 which banned the use of racial preferences in admissions the state experienced a significant decline in enrollment rates across its educational institutions. Most notable was the decline in Black student enrollment at the University of California Los Angeles UCLA. In 2006 only 96 students less than 2 selfidentified as Black out of a freshman class of nearly 5000 students.  Although enrollment rates have shown some improvement since then disparities in enrollment persist. For example a mere 228 students 3 at the University of California Berkeley identified themselves as Black out of a nearly 7000strong freshman class in the fall of 2022. By comparison the 2021 2022 high school graduating class in California had approximately 8700 Black students that met the requirements for admission into the University of California system. These limited strides in fostering diversity have come at a substantial cost to the University of California system exceeding half a billion dollars in investments since 2004. Likewise at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor enrollment rates for students of color experienced a decline following the state s adoption of Proposal 2 commonly known as the Affirmative Action Initiative in 2006. This voter referendum also led to a state constitutional ban on raceconscious admissions. By 2021 Black enrollment stood at a mere 4 a three percentage point drop from 2006. This is despite the growth of collegeage African Americans in Michigan from 16 to 19. Clearly the University of Michigan has encountered challenges in ensuring that their flagship school reflects the diverse demographics of the state.  The ban on affirmative action has made it more arduous for many universities to achieve proportional representation of underrepresented groups and imposes new constraints in racial equity and equal opportunity in higher education. As an alternative to racebased admissions certain schools and advocates have suggested considering socioeconomic status including wealth as a criterion for preference in college admissions irrespective of race. However this raceblind alternative falls short in capturing the full scope of what racebased admissions could achieve. Focusing solely on socioeconomic status fails to address the specific obstacles that affirmative action was intended to combat.  One significant drawback of this raceblind approach is its potential exclusion of deserving middleclass Black Brown and Native American students. These students may not meet the criteria for preferential treatment based on low socioeconomic status despite facing racial disparities and encountering systemic barriers that hinder their educational opportunities. By overlooking the importance of race this alternative fails to acknowledge the need to uplift marginalized racial and ethnic groups who may not fit neatly into a socioeconomicbased framework. Moreover according to Richard Rothstein author of The Color of Law A Forgotten History of How Our Government Segregated America and the recently released Just Action How to challenge segregation enacted under the color of law when considering wealthbased admissions it is important to acknowledge the significantly larger population of white Americans compared with African Americans. While a higher proportion of the Black population falls into the lowwealth category the potential pool of lowwealth applicants would still consist of a significantly larger number of white students. According to Federal Reserve data from 2019 31 of youths from households in the bottom quarter of the national wealth distribution with a net worth of 12400 or less are Black. Even if preference was given to students in the bottom half of the wealth distribution with a net worth of 121700 or less a smaller proportion of the eligible lowwealth applicants 24 would be Black. Despite the belief that Black people may be overrepresented in a wealthbased program the alternative would still be flawed in capturing many Black students. Classbased admissions based on household income have also been a popular alternative to racebased admissions but similarly to wealth this criteria would fall short of the diversity objectives set by admissions offices and undermine efforts to address discrimination. According to a study by Georgetown University s Center on Education and the Workforce selective colleges that are prohibited from considering race and ethnicity in admissions decisions may regain some level of racial and ethnic diversity by adopting classconscious admissions practices. However the study highlights the considerable difficulties these institutions would encounter in achieving student bodies that accurately reflect the demographic diversity of their state s high school population which typically exhibits higher rates of enrollment across different racial groups compared with universities. The findings suggest that maintaining or surpassing existing representation without raceconscious admissions would necessitate a complete overhaul of the admissions system requiring changes in applicant evaluation and consideration criteria. While socioeconomic status can be a relevant factor in addressing certain forms of disadvantage and college education should absolutely be more accessible to low and middleincome students of all races socioeconomic status alone cannot fully replace the multifaceted impact of racebased admissions.  The pending Supreme Court decision on student loan debt forgiveness adds an additional layer of complexity to using socioeconomic status as a proxy for race in achieving diversity. Student loan debt is yet another barrier hindering students of color from accessing higher education. Without student loan debt forgiveness students of color hailing from lowincome backgrounds encounter even greater disparities in economic outcomes. Irrespective of whether these students gain admission to universities based on their socioeconomic status the intersection of student loan debt structural racism and poverty magnifies the existing gaps in their ability to afford and enroll in higher education institutions. This could impede efforts to achieve a more inclusive and diverse student body based on race and socioeconomic factors.  The complexities of racial discrimination and the need for targeted measures to address historical injustices cannot be adequately captured by a raceblind approach alone. It is crucial to recognize the unique and ongoing struggles faced by underrepresented racial and ethnic groups and continue to advocate for holistic solutions that address both socioeconomic disparities and the significance of race in admissions policies. Affirmative action programs in higher education came into existence specifically to rectify the history of racebased exclusion legally enforced segregation and quota systems that capped the number of nonwhite or other minority students permitted to enroll at colleges and universities across the country. This history of discrimination had everything to do with barring students based on race regardless of their class and led to many of the enrollment disparities we still see today at many institutions. The adoption of raceblind admissions would not provide greater benefits to students of color compared with the existing impact of racebased admissions. Instead any alternative approach would likely harm the enrollment rates of these marginalized groups and prove financially burdensome to implement. It is imperative to recognize the significance of race in addressing systemic inequalities and to prioritize inclusive measures that safeguard access to higher education for underrepresented communities. Universities should persist in advocating for affirmative action specifically for Black Brown and Native American applicants. In an open letter issued a month before the Court s ruling the presidents of 27 liberal arts colleges stated To fulfill the promise of economic and social mobility we need to continue rectifying the systemic barriers that have kept so many talented students of color out of higher education. Rothstein argues that university presidents defending affirmative action programs on the grounds of rectifying past injustices could sway lowercourt judges and dissenting justices to support affirmative action as a valid remedy. This approach may also pave the way for future Supreme Court justices to reject raceblind ideologies that currently impede reform efforts. Ultimately maintaining intersectional admissions processes that include race is essential to promoting equity and redressing systemic barriers to higher education.
