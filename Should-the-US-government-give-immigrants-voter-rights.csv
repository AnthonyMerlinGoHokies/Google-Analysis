https://www.city-journal.org/article/migrants-shouldnt-be-allowed-to-vote, In December 2021 the New York City Council passed Local Law 11 a bill to allow some 800000 lawfully present noncitizens to vote in local elections. Supporters hailed it as a civil rights victory for everyone who calls the Big Apple home. At the time their strongest argument voiced by thenSpeaker Corey Johnson was also the simplest They are part of our community and they deserve a say in local government.  Nobody then could have foreseen that 19 months later more than 90000 asylumseeking migrants would descend on New York City rapidly filling up 56000 beds in publicly supplied shelters and hotel rooms. Had the law been implemented according to schedule many of these migrants would have become eligible to vote in this year s city elections upon receiving work authorization. They are currently ineligible because local Republicans won a court injunction last year. The case is currently working its way through an intermediatelevel appeal. The migrant crisis has undermined the law s justification and revealed its practical shortcomings. Mayor Eric Adams shouldn t wait for a final judgment from the Court of Appeals he should withdraw his appeal and let the injunction stand. To vote is to participate in an act of collective selfdetermination which necessarily entails defining who does and does not belong to that collective. If you extend the franchise too broadly say to adolescents or inhabitants of another country then some of those who exercise it will not have sufficient stake in or knowledge of the community. If you define voting rights more narrowly then you risk preventing some from having a full and equal say in decisions that affect them. Contemporary political understanding broadly recognizes citizenship as the most important relationship between a nationstate and its people. The right to make democratic decisions about a community is therefore usually linked to those who belong to that community in other words to citizens. Local Law 11 effectively sought to define New York s political community as something distinct from U.S. citizenship. It established a new class of municipal voter allowing individuals to register to vote in city elections if they ve lived in New York City for a mere 30 consecutive days are not U.S. citizens and are legally authorized to work in the United States. Many state and local leaders including Mayor Adams and Governor Kathy Hochul have urged the Biden administration to expedite migrant work authorization such as by rescinding or shortening the sixmonth waiting period after filing a claim of asylum. But if Local Law 11 takes effect expedited work authorization would enfranchise tens of thousands of individuals who potentially cannot or do not want to remain longterm residents of New York City. Federal asylum protections apply only to those fleeing persecution or a wellfounded fear of persecution not dire economic conditions. Many recent asylumseekers fled destitution in places like Venezuela and Colombia not persecution for their politics race or religion. After a hearing these individuals will be subject to deportation. Granted this process could take years and relatively few migrants have yet to apply formally for asylum with the federal government. But those circumstances could easily change for example the government could hire more immigration judges speeding up the process. Many migrants will indeed find ways to contribute positively to the city and all deserve our sympathy after their trials in arriving in the U.S. Nevertheless residing in city shelters and hotels for uncertain but limited durations complicates their ability to integrate seamlessly into their surrounding communities. After all they didn t choose their neighborhoods the government has placed them in facilities across the city and sometimes even moved them from site to site. Having fled desperate poverty in their countries of origin most are quite understandably largely interested in selfpreservation not in learning enough about the American system of government and local circumstances to become informed and conscientious voters. It s reasonable to assume therefore that the causes and candidates most motivating to these prospective new voters would be those who offer more generous shortterm public assistance such as the housingvoucher legislation that became law last month over Adams s veto. City Hall estimates the law will cost 17 billion over five years. Given their common situation and interests it s also reasonable to believe that migrants would tend to vote as a bloc or interest group resulting in a potent force in lowturnout local elections. June s primary races for city council for example saw fewer than 200000 voters turn out citywide out of 3.1 million active registered Democrats. Many races failed to break 10 percent of eligible voters. Most candidates won with a few thousand votes. Given this meager turnout newly enfranchised migrants could meaningfully shape city council races tempting primary challengers to woo them with promises of greater benefits. The danger also arises that noncitizens will accidentally vote in state or federal elections. As I wrote early last year even a single ballot containing federal or state races handed to a noncitizen by a poorly trained or distracted poll worker could spell serious trouble loss of the opportunity for naturalization fines and imprisonment or deportation. In June despite the oddyear election timing the Bronx and Queens held primaries for district attorney which is a state office. Having come only recently from countries with vastly different political systems many migrants are unfamiliar with American federalism and may not know the difference between federal state and local races. And no one should count on the city Board of Elections to get things right consistently. New York s migrant crisis has caused the mayor enough frustration. Local Law 11 would only compound his headaches. John Ketcham is the director of state and local policy at the Manhattan Institute.

Clemente File  By ALI SWENSON Updated hourminute AMPM timezone monthFull day year Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print NEW YORK AP Donald Trump is seizing on his party s frustration with the recent surge of illegal crossings at the southern U.S. border to churn up fears around another top GOP concern voter fraud. In the final stretch before Iowa s caucuses next Monday the former Republican president has repeatedly suggested that Democrats are encouraging migrants to flow into the country illegally in order to register them to vote in the 2024 election. The unsupported claim which Trump and other Republicans have carted out in past election years is resonating with voters who agree that security is lacking at both the border and the polls. Experts say it also can be damaging giving undue traction to false stereotypes and extremist ideologies such as the racist great replacement theory.  The GOP frontrunner flicked at the idea of Democrats registering unauthorized migrants to vote at least twice over the weekend in Iowa.  I think they really are doing it because they want to sign these people up to vote. I really do Trump said in Mason City on Friday. They can t speak a word of English for the most part but they re signing them up.   Trump will meet with a senior Japanese official after court session in his hush money trial What to know in the Supreme Court case about immunity for former President Trump Pennsylvania s primary will cement Casey McCormick as nominees in battleground US Senate race The comments came after he posted recently on his Truth Social platform that crazed Democrats are allowing unvetted migrants into the country so they can vote vote vote.  His message is welcome to some of Trump s Iowa supporters who are still angry about the outcome of the 2020 election. Trump continues to promote the lie that widespread fraud cost him reelection despite multiple audits reviews and recounts in the battleground states where he disputed the results dozens of failed legal challenges and his own attorney general saying there was no evidence to back up the claims. Michell Harvilla awaiting Trump s appearance in Clinton Iowa on Saturday said she absolutely believes Democrats favor allowing people into the country illegally to influence the 2024 election.  I fully believe the last one was rigged said the 58yearold middle school library and media director who caucused for Ted Cruz in 2016 but voted for Trump twice. Billionaire Elon Musk also has pushed the narrative on his social media platform X in recent days claiming that Democrats are importing voters.  The Trump campaign didn t immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. In response to an email directed to Musk the platform sent only an automated response. These claims ignore the facts around noncitizen voting in federal elections which is illegal and remains exceedingly rare even as it is thoroughly scrutinized according to Sean MoralesDoyle director of voting rights at the Brennan Center for Justice.  Anyone registering to vote in the U.S. must attest under penalty of perjury that they are a U.S. citizen MoralesDoyle said. Lying is punishable by fines imprisonment and deportation he said such steep penalties that very few people are willing to accept the risk. On top of that federal law requires states to regularly maintain their voter rolls and remove anyone ineligible a process that identifies immigrants living in the country illegally. Even with this and other vetting processes in place only a small number of noncitizen voters have been uncovered evidence that Trump s theory has no teeth MoralesDoyle said. In 2017 the Brennan Center examined 42 local jurisdictions around the country in the 2016 election including some of the most populous counties in Arizona California Florida and Texas. Of 23.5 million votes cast election officials found only about 30 cases of potential noncitizen voting that they referred for prosecution or further investigation. More recent investigations also haven t shown proof of widespread noncitizen voting. A Georgia audit of its voter rolls conducted in 2022 found fewer than 2000 instances of noncitizens attempting to register to vote for 25 years none of which succeeded. Millions of new Georgia voters registered during that period. Occasional instances in which noncitizens have been found to cast ballots illegally or attempted to register captured widespread attention helping feed the narrative that they are voting in large numbers. Ahead of the 2022 midterms Colorado s secretary of state mistakenly sent postcards to about 30000 noncitizens that encouraged them to register to vote a problem apparently connected to the state s driver s license database. The office said no noncitizens would be allowed to register if they tried. The Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles an organization that encourages voter participation among Latinos said it hasn t found evidence of noncitizens voting in its decades of advocacy work.  The Latino and immigrant communities know the law the group said in an emailed statement. Suggesting that nonEnglish speakers are somehow less qualified to vote than other populations also is misleading said MoralesDoyle. The Voting Rights Act bans voting discrimination against language minorities and builds in requirements for language assistance at the polls he said. Federal law doesn t stop states or municipalities from granting noncitizens the right to vote in local races. Some have among them several cities in Maryland and Vermont while several states ban the practice. New York City passed a law in 2022 that would allow legally documented noncitizens and Dreamers to vote for mayor and other elected officials but a judge blocked the move. On the flip side some states and federal lawmakers have sought to require voters to provide documentary proof of citizenship when they register. But these efforts have been challenged by advocates and blocked by federal courts for the burden they impose on voters. The Brennan Center and other advocacy groups say proofofcitizenship requirements disenfranchise people when many eligible voters don t have birth certificates or other applicable documents at hand. They say providing citizenship proof is an unnecessary step when research shows noncitizens are not voting in significant numbers. Trump s claims that noncitizens are casting ballots aren t new. After the 2016 election he falsely claimed in a private meeting with congressional leaders that he would have won the popular vote if it weren t for the votes of 3 million to 5 million immigrants living in the country illegally. Yet the idea may be especially effective with his base now as videos of migrants traveling to the border inundate social media amid a massive surge in migration through the U.S. border with Mexico that the nation s leaders are still struggling to address. An estimated 10.5 million people were living illegally in the United States in 2021 according to Pew Research Center s latest figures published in November. That snapshot was taken before the recent surge of migrants from around the world a break from the recent past when migrants primarily came from Mexico and Central America. Millions are in the U.S. seeking asylum or entering on parole a legal authority granted for humanitarian reasons or when deemed a significant public benefit. Asylumseekers and those on parole may be eligible to work but cannot vote. That right is exclusively held for citizens unless specifically allowed for local elections. U.S. authorities made 5.9 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from March 2021 when a COVIDinspired lull ended through November 2023. That included a recordhigh 2.2 million arrests in the 12month period ending Sept. 30 2022. Many people are released to seek asylum in immigration courts which are backlogged with 3 million cases that take years to decide. The White House and Congress are negotiating how best to reduce the number of migrants traveling to the southern border. Meanwhile public confusion around border policy leaves room for false claims to spread said Jared Holt a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue a Londonbased think tank that tracks online hate disinformation and extremism. He said false noncitizen voting claims over the years have helped build support for a more sinister conspiracy theory about a grand plot to diminish the influence of white Americans by replacing them with minorities.  It s sort of a tongueincheek way of pushing the great replacement theory but in a way that has been understood to be less morally repugnant or perceivably more defensible Holt said. I don t think you have to scratch very far below the surface to understand what is really being said.  Associated Press writers Tom Beaumont in Clinton Iowa Christina A.

https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/10/opinions/new-york-city-noncitizen-voting-smart-policy-reyes/index.html,  Bravo to New York s City Council for taking a meaningful step towards inclusion and representation.   Thursday New York became the largest American city to give noncitizens the right to vote in local elections. The New York City Council passed the Our City Our Vote measure by a more than twotoone vote. Under the legislation noncitizens who are legal permanent residents and have lived in the city for at least 30 days will be allowed to vote in elections for mayor public advocate city council among other local offices. The legislation is set to go into effect in January 2023.   Raul A. Reyes CNN Allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections is smart policy that is legally sound. It will strengthen communities and give more residents an investment in politics that affect their daily lives. And allowing noncitizens to vote is rooted in both American tradition and ideals.   To be clear New York s move is not about allowing undocumented people to vote. The legislation passed largely affects legal immigrants such as green card holders people with work permits and young people who have qualified for the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program. Nor does the new legislation allow noncitizens to vote in federal elections.   The strongest case in favor of noncitizens voting is the easiest to grasp. There are about 15 million legal nonresidents in the country and about 800000 in New York City. These are our neighbors who pay taxes send their children to public schools start businesses and contribute to their communities. They should be able to elect leaders and have a say in local politics just like anyone else.   Giving noncitizens the right to vote will encourage civic engagement thereby strengthening the cities that allow it. The more people who vote the more accurately leaders and policies will reflect their constituencies.   The New York state GOP has vowed to take action against the legislation including taking any legal action necessary to prevent the bill from becoming law. But the Constitution does not prohibit noncitizens from voting. In Minor v. Happersett 1874 the US Supreme Court affirmed citizenship has not in all cases been made a condition precedent to the enjoyment of the right of suffrage.   Voters stand in booths at a voting station at the Metropolitan Museum of Art MET during the mayoral election process in New York on June 12 2021. ED JONESAFPGetty Images Related article New York City gives noncitizens right to vote in local elections   It might surprise people to know allowing noncitizens to vote is an idea that is neither new nor radical. Voting by noncitizens has a history going back to the founding of our country. From 1776 to 1926 San Francisco State University Professor Ron Hayduk notes noncitizens could vote in local state and some national elections some could also hold office.   Even today although New York state s constitution says every citizen shall be entitled to vote at every election it does not say noncitizens cannot vote. This distinction will be important for the expected legal challenges to New York City s measure.   The city s move is part of a growing although slow trend towards expanding the electorate. A handful of jurisdictions in the US already allow noncitizens to vote including nine Maryland cities and San Francisco. Noncitizen voting legislation is being considered in Massachusetts Illinois and the District of Columbia as well. New York City allowing noncitizens to vote could pave the way for more localities to move ahead with similar measures.   There is a practical component to the case for allowing noncitizens to vote too. If a green card holder wants to naturalize and become a citizen it takes money for fees and legal expenses and most importantly time. In 2019 the New York Times reported it took an average of 10 months for aspiring Americans to go through the naturalization process and that is on top of the at least five years green card holders must wait before they can apply for naturalization. It is not fair that these potential citizens should go so long without any civic voice as their cases wind their way through our backlogged immigration system.   Consider that our country was founded upon the ideas of no taxation without representation or that the Declaration of Independence states Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed. Barring noncitizens from voting would seem to violate both of these principles.   Sign up for CNN Opinion s new newsletter.Join us on Twitter and Facebook   Predictably Republicans have quickly come out against New York City s legislation. Allowing our elections to be decided by foreign citizens is unacceptable and the RNC is looking closely at our legal options as we continue our fight to protect your ballot Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement.   Her words are almost laughable given that Republicanled legislatures across the country have consistently moved to restrict voting access. Nineteen states have passed 33 news laws this year that make it harder to vote according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice. And the conservative majority installed by Republicans on the US Supreme Court has been chipping away at voting rights for years. Republicans have no legal or moral standing to whine about protecting the right to vote.   New York City did the right thing in moving towards allowing noncitizens to vote. It will be good for the city and good for democracy.

No states allowed noncitizens to vote in statewide elections. Federal law stated that noncitizens may not vote in federal elections but did not specify whether they could in state or local elections. Whether noncitizens should be allowed to vote is a subject of debate.  Some arguments concern whether to enfranchise noncitizens living in the country legally such as permanent residents or those with temporary visas while others include noncitizens in the country without legal permission. This section includes quotes briefly summarizing some of the most prevalent arguments for and against noncitizen voting. Four arguments in support of allowing noncitizens to vote are that prohibiting them from doing so is unjust because of barriers to naturalization that prohibiting them from voting encourages discriminatory public policy that allowing noncitizens to vote doesnt discourage them from seeking citizenship and that allowing noncitizens to vote promotes policy that benefits society as a whole.  This section details those arguments from a variety of sources arranged by topic. Dallas Morning News Community Voices columnist Rosemary Curts argued that a prohibition on noncitizen legal resident voting was akin to a poll tax due to the financial cost of becoming a citizen. One woman I spoke to has lived here since she was five years old. Alejandra came to the U.S. legally and she regularly gets her green card renewed. She has been a permanent resident for more than 35 years. Alejandra said she knows she should try to become a citizen but it costs upwards of 1000 with legal fees. She has a decent job but like plenty of citizens in the United States she doesnt have a spare 1000.  The fact that noncitizen legal immigrants in the U.S. cannot vote is a form of voter suppression. Laws like the poll tax were struck down because our courts decided that financial barriers to voting were unconstitutional. But how is the financial barrier of becoming a citizen any different? 3  San Francisco State University political science professor Ron Hayduk argued in a Jacobin piece that noncitizens living in the country either with or without legal permission should be able to vote. He said that prohibiting noncitizens from voting encourages policy that discriminates against them. Although hardly homogeneous immigrants as a group tend to score low on many social indicators of wellbeing including income poverty hunger and education. Such outcomes are the result at least in part of political disenfranchisement. Politicians can enact discriminatory public policy and private practices in employment housing education health care welfare and criminal justice and run xenophobic campaigns secure in the knowledge that noncitizens won t be able to punish them at the polls. 3  Law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law Joshua A. Douglas argued that allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections would not disincentivize them from seeking citizenship and could encourage them to do so.  Local laws and policies affect noncitizens every day. Efforts to give legal noncitizens voting rights are significant because they help provide a voice to those with a vested stake in their communities as well as a sense of belonging. Allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections could actually increase the likelihood that they seek full citizenship. Meanwhile federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections so granting voting rights for only local elections will not deter them from seeking their citizenship and the full rights it entails. 3  Hayduk argued that allowing noncitizens to vote would benefit society as a whole by promoting policy that benefits marginalized communities as opposed to elites. Extending suffrage would also benefit the larger society. We all share the same interest in having good schools affordable housing effective transportation environmental justice and so on. Allowing a permanent class of nonvoters to persist on the margins benefits elites that wish to profit from undocumented people s labor and divide workers between those with papers and those without them. Far from diluting the concept of citizenship noncitizen voting would enrich it by fully incorporating immigrants. Rather than undermining democracy it would counteract elitedriven policy and promote more robust democratic practices. 3  Four arguments against allowing noncitizens to vote are that people should accept the duties of citizenship before being allowed to vote that prohibiting noncitizens from voting is not discriminatory that allowing noncitizens to vote would discourage them from seeking citizenship and that allowing them to vote would not benefit society as a whole.  This section details those arguments from a variety of sources arranged by topic. The New York Post editorial board wrote an editorial in response to City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguezs D effort to allow noncitizen residents legally living in the city to vote in local elections. The editorial board argued that noncitizens should have to accept the duties of citizenship before being allowed to vote.  Citizenship should mean something and the right to vote is a big part of it. And while most Americans are born citizens an immigrant s affirmative decision to become a citizen is a vital acceptance of duties as well as privileges.  I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince potentate state or sovereignty reads the oath of allegiance for the newly naturalized. And I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic and bear true faith and allegiance to the same including military service and other work of national importance as required by law. 3  U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan RS.C. introduced a bill in 2019 that would have barred federal funding to states and localities that allow noncitizen voting. In a National Review piece he argued that prohibiting noncitizens from voting is not discriminatory. An alien voluntarily comes to the United States in search of a better life hoping to work and to be part of the American experience a process I support if it s done legally. If they have concerns about what they believe to be discriminatory aspects of our laws they are absolutely free not to come and in the vast majority of cases retain full voting rights in their native countries. The 147 million people in the world who d like to immigrate to the United States and the uptomultidecade greencard backlog suggests to me that the actual practical concerns about discriminatory public policy aren t very serious. The aliens themselves certainly don t think so. 3  Opinion columnist Ross K. Baker argued in USA Today that the right to vote in local elections combined with the benefits some noncitizen immigrants may receive in the state of Maine would disincentivize them from going through the process of becoming citizens.  The right to vote is a component of citizenship. It is not a dispensation granted to those who may or may not apply for citizenship. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are both tangible and intangible but remaining a resident alien is not without its benefits. In addition to federal benefits there is a General Assistance program funded largely by the state immigrants can receive around 800 a month. Unless the emotional urge to pursue citizenship is unusually strong the combination of the social welfare benefits and the right to vote in city elections diminishes the incentive to jump through the hoops required of those who seek to become citizens. 3  Rep. Duncan argued that allowing noncitizens to vote would not benefit society by encouraging public policy that improves conditions for marginalized communities. Finally there s the mutualbenefit argument which suggests that if aliens are allowed to vote then they can make common cause with other marginalized groups in our society and come together for the mutual improvement of our country. This is a classic example of how identity politics erases individuals. Who is to say that a single male alien from Honduras has the same interests as for example a female highschool principal who is an American citizen in a lowincome community? It is just as likely that they have competing interests. The Honduran might be a construction worker and therefore might benefit from reduced taxes on the construction industry while the principal might benefit from increased spending on education. The history of immigration and assimilation is littered with these types of examples. 3  ifdocument.getElementsByClassNamereference.length0 ifdocument.getElementByIdFootnotes!null document.getElementByIdFootnotes.parentNode.style.display none Communications Alison Graves Carley Allensworth Abigail Campbell Sarah Groat Erica ShumakerExternal Relations Andrew Heath Moira Delaney Hannah NelsonOperations Meghann Olshefski Amanda Herbert Mandy Morris Caroline Presnell Kelly RindfleischPolicy Caitlin Styrsky Molly Byrne Jon Dunn Jimmy McAllister Annelise ReinwaldResearch Josh Altic Tech Matt Latourelle Ryan Burch Kirsten Corrao Beth Dellea Travis Eden Tate Kamish Margaret Kearney Eric Lotto Trevor Pollo Joseph Sanchez Ballotpedia features 477486 encyclopedic articles written and curated by our professional staff of editors writers and researchers.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/06/truth-about-noncitizen-voting-federal-elections/,  Former president Donald Trump in remarks in Eagle Pass Tex. Feb. 29  That s why they are allowing these people to come in people that don t speak our language they are signing them up to vote.   Trump in remarks during a rally in Sioux Center Iowa Jan. 5 Decrying the surge of undocumented immigrants at the southern border Trump has suggested a nefarious reason for it a desire by President Biden to tip the 2024 vote by enlisting migrants to cast ballots. Trump s musings are reflected on social media with the phrase they are importing voters spread across X formerly known as Twitter by many users including the site s owner Elon Musk. Trump s fearmongering about votes allegedly cast by noncitizens is not new. But fresh research by a professor often cited by Trump s supporters further undercuts his claims. After he was elected president with a narrow margin in the electoral college he insisted without evidence that the reason Hillary Clinton won 2.8 million more votes was that at least 3 million votes were cast by undocumented immigrants. When Trump lost the 2020 election where by the popular vote count Biden beat him by 7 million votes Trump claimed that Biden s margin of victory in key states such as in Arizona was provided by noncitizens. Biden won Arizona by just over 10000 votes and Trump falsely said that 36000 noncitizens had voted in the state. Trump s reiteration of that claim in his speech on Jan. 6 2021 to supporters who later attacked the Capitol is referenced in the federal indictment accusing him of conspiring to overturn the election results. Trump s supporters echoed the falsehood. Rudy Giuliani Trump s personal attorney lost his law license after a committee of judges from New York s First Department Appellate Division cited his widely divergent false and misleading claims about noncitizens voting in Arizona including way more than 10000 the bare minimum is 40 or 50000 and the reality is probably about 250000.  The claim that undocumented immigrants vote in such numbers that they can swing a presidential election has weakened considerably since 2016. A researcher long cited by Trump and his allies has now dug into Arizona s voter and driver s license records and in documents filed under seal in court and obtained by The Fact Checker dramatically recast his findings. He still believes that data suggests that noncitizens cast some votes that are not easily detected by authorities but says the numbers did not change the result in the state. Federal law bans noncitizens from voting in federal elections including races for president vice president Senate or House of Representatives. Under a law adopted in 1996 noncitizens who vote can face a fine or a prison term as long as a year or both not to mention deportation. Until the 1920s when there was a wave of antiimmigrant sentiment 22 states and federal territories allowed noncitizens to vote in state elections. Now only a few jurisdictions in California Illinois and Maryland notably Chicago and San Francisco allow some form of noncitizen voting. Some states such as Ohio and Louisiana in recent years have enacted constitutional bans on noncitizen voting. A majority of states 36 requests or requires voters to show some sort of identification when they vote according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Increasingly states also are seeking ways to require proof of citizenship to vote or are considering ways to update voter lists to eliminate any noncitizens. Voting rights advocates have argued that such requirements are burdensome as few Americans carry around birth certificates naturalization certificates or passports even if they have such documents. The Supreme Court in a 72 vote in 2013 invalidated an Arizona law that prospective voters in Arizona provide proof of citizenship to be able to register to vote in national elections. The majority opinion written by Justice Antonin Scalia said the state could not reject a federal voter registration form which does not require such documentation the form requires only that an applicant under penalty of perjury affirm that he or she is a citizen. About 19000 registered voters in Arizona are federalonly meaning they filled out a federal form and vote only in federal elections. After the 2020 election the Arizona legislature passed bills that required proof of citizenship to participate in state elections and verification of the status of registered voters who had not provided proof of their citizenship. U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton last week upheld some provisions saying that the court concludes that Arizona s interests in preventing noncitizens from voting and promoting public confidence in Arizona s elections outweighs the limited burden voters might encounter when required to provide proof of citizenship. There is scattered evidence of noncitizens voting in federal elections sometime by mistake such as erroneously thinking they were eligible while getting a driver s license but also with nefarious intent. The conservative Heritage Foundation maintains a database dating to 1979 that it says includes a sampling of electionfraud cases brought by prosecutors. In that period about 2 billion votes have been cast in federal elections according to a calculation for The Fact Checker by the Brennan Center for Justice. A recent search of the Heritage database found 85 cases involving allegations of noncitizen voting from 2002 to 2023. A large percentage of the cases took place in North Carolina where authorities have been aggressive in targeting noncitizen voting. In 2022 Georgia announced that it had completed a citizenship review of the state s voter rolls and discovered that 1634 people over 25 years had attempted to register to vote even though they were not U.S. citizens. But none had been permitted to register to vote and thus had not cast ballots. Sometimes state efforts to track down noncitizen voting backfire. Texas in 2019 flagged 100000 voters as possible noncitizens but at least 25000 were erroneously flagged because of data mixups. Fourteen voters were removed from voting rolls and then had to be reinstated. A federal judge halted the effort saying it unfairly targeted naturalized citizens and eventually Texas abandoned the effort. This is a solution looking for a problem U.S. District Judge Fred Biery said. Still Texas s difficulties illustrate how difficult it might be uncover voting by noncitizens without running afoul of constitutional protections. In the Arizona case Bolton nullified a provision that would require voters to list their place of birth saying it violated the Civil Rights Act and the National Voter Registration Act and would result in investigations of only naturalized citizens. Given the paucity of evidence of noncitizen voting many election researchers have long said that there was little to support the idea that noncitizen voting had ever affected the outcome of a major election. But that does not necessarily prove that the phenomenon does not happen. Unlike many crimes if a noncitizen casts a ballot there is no obvious victim to make a complaint and little public documentation to prove that a voter is not a citizen. Trump and his supporters often point to a 2014 study by a team led by Jesse Richman of Old Dominion University. Using 2008 and 2010 data from the Cooperative Election Study which requires respondents to opt in Richman estimated that 6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008 and 2.2 percent voted in 2010. Of those voters 4 in 5 voted for Barack Obama he said.  Participation was large enough to plausibly account for Democratic victories in a few close elections Richman wrote in a summary of his report in The Washington Post in 2014. Noncitizen votes could have given Senate Democrats the pivotal 60th vote needed to overcome filibusters in order to pass healthcare reform and other Obama administration priorities in the 111th Congress.  Richman s findings immediately came under attack from other researchers who said that the data set was too small to be useful and that some of it appeared to be misclassified. Richman stood by his report but in 2017 he also said that the Trump team misinterpreted his findings I can t quite account for the math being so badly wrong in their analyses and that noncitizens could not have provided the popularvote edge to Clinton. Richman s 2014 study continues to be cited. One researcher relied on its findings of noncitizen voting to calculate that more than 51000 noncitizens voted in Arizona in 2020 theoretically giving Biden almost an additional 18000 votes that tipped the state in his favor. As an expert defense witness in the case overseen by Bolton Richman was permitted to examine state voter files and a file from the Department of Motor Vehicles crossreferencing the information. In her ruling Bolton said the Court found Dr. Richman s testimony credible and affords his opinions considerable weight. He produced a detailed 123page report and a short supplemental report which Bolton placed under seal given the sensitivity of the data. The Fact Checker obtained a redacted version after submitting a public records request. Richman said he found that 1934 voters 0.43 percent of Arizona votingage noncitizens had records that indicated they were not citizens at the time they registered or after registering to vote. There are more than 4 million registered voters in Arizona so the noncitizen segment would be about 0.04 percent. Assuming a 50 percent turnout which is typical in U.S. elections that means fewer than 1000 noncitizen votes out of 3.4 million cast in the 2020 election in Arizona. At the upper range from less precise records also indicating noncitizenship Richman said he located 6480 voters or 1.44 percent of votingage noncitizens. With 50 percent turnout that would mean about threequarters of a percentage may have voted. Both figures are substantially lower than the 6.4 percent of noncitizens in 2008 and 2.2 percent in 2010 that Richman estimated had voted in his widely cited 2014 paper.  The records were matched on the driver s license identification number which was a unique identifier present in both databases Richman told The Fact Checker in an email. It s possible of course that in some instances this number might have been entered wrong so there is some possibility of a false match.   The evidence very clearly doesn t document or demonstrate anything close to the claim that the Arizona Presidential election was decided by noncitizens in 2020 he added. As part of his report Richman also examined 2022 data from the Cooperative Election Study which now has a more precise way of asking a question about a voter s citizenship and a larger sample size than the surveys he studied for his 2014 paper. He found that just under 1 percent of noncitizens indicated they had registered to vote again much smaller than his previous findings.  These sources all align quite well in terms of suggesting that the likely rate of noncitizen registration or attempted registration nationwide is slightly less than one percent and a voting participation of half a percent Richman wrote. I conclude that the incidence of noncitizen participation or attempted participation in U.S. and Arizona elections through registration or voting is low but nonzero.  Justin Levitt a law professor at Loyola Marymount University who was skeptical of Richman s earlier research said in an email that while the CES data here does look to me to be more reliable than Prof. Richman s prior forays I d need some more information before I believed it were reliable. He also said he would be curious to know how many of the noncitizens who registered in Arizona cast ballots as turnout could be lower than average. The issue Levitt said is whether rooting out a relatively small number of noncitizen voters is worth the potential cost.  For purposes of the policy question for me it s always been a costbenefit analysis he said. I don t think anyone s against security measures that don t harm any legitimate voters in the process. But if your security measure has an impact on legitimate voters far higher than any security effect on ineligible voters it s creating more problems than it s solving.  Bolton in her ruling said she did not find that the new Arizona laws were enacted with discriminatory intent. But she noted The Court finds that though it may occur noncitizens voting in Arizona is quite rare and noncitizen voter fraud in Arizona is rarer still.

No states allowed noncitizens to vote in statewide elections. Federal law stated that noncitizens may not vote in federal elections but did not specify whether they could in state or local elections. Whether noncitizens should be allowed to vote is a subject of debate.  Some arguments concern whether to enfranchise noncitizens living in the country legally such as permanent residents or those with temporary visas while others include noncitizens in the country without legal permission. This section includes quotes briefly summarizing some of the most prevalent arguments for and against noncitizen voting. Four arguments in support of allowing noncitizens to vote are that prohibiting them from doing so is unjust because of barriers to naturalization that prohibiting them from voting encourages discriminatory public policy that allowing noncitizens to vote doesnt discourage them from seeking citizenship and that allowing noncitizens to vote promotes policy that benefits society as a whole.  This section details those arguments from a variety of sources arranged by topic. Dallas Morning News Community Voices columnist Rosemary Curts argued that a prohibition on noncitizen legal resident voting was akin to a poll tax due to the financial cost of becoming a citizen. One woman I spoke to has lived here since she was five years old. Alejandra came to the U.S. legally and she regularly gets her green card renewed. She has been a permanent resident for more than 35 years. Alejandra said she knows she should try to become a citizen but it costs upwards of 1000 with legal fees. She has a decent job but like plenty of citizens in the United States she doesnt have a spare 1000.  The fact that noncitizen legal immigrants in the U.S. cannot vote is a form of voter suppression. Laws like the poll tax were struck down because our courts decided that financial barriers to voting were unconstitutional. But how is the financial barrier of becoming a citizen any different? 3  San Francisco State University political science professor Ron Hayduk argued in a Jacobin piece that noncitizens living in the country either with or without legal permission should be able to vote. He said that prohibiting noncitizens from voting encourages policy that discriminates against them. Although hardly homogeneous immigrants as a group tend to score low on many social indicators of wellbeing including income poverty hunger and education. Such outcomes are the result at least in part of political disenfranchisement. Politicians can enact discriminatory public policy and private practices in employment housing education health care welfare and criminal justice and run xenophobic campaigns secure in the knowledge that noncitizens won t be able to punish them at the polls. 3  Law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law Joshua A. Douglas argued that allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections would not disincentivize them from seeking citizenship and could encourage them to do so.  Local laws and policies affect noncitizens every day. Efforts to give legal noncitizens voting rights are significant because they help provide a voice to those with a vested stake in their communities as well as a sense of belonging. Allowing noncitizens to vote in local elections could actually increase the likelihood that they seek full citizenship. Meanwhile federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections so granting voting rights for only local elections will not deter them from seeking their citizenship and the full rights it entails. 3  Hayduk argued that allowing noncitizens to vote would benefit society as a whole by promoting policy that benefits marginalized communities as opposed to elites. Extending suffrage would also benefit the larger society. We all share the same interest in having good schools affordable housing effective transportation environmental justice and so on. Allowing a permanent class of nonvoters to persist on the margins benefits elites that wish to profit from undocumented people s labor and divide workers between those with papers and those without them. Far from diluting the concept of citizenship noncitizen voting would enrich it by fully incorporating immigrants. Rather than undermining democracy it would counteract elitedriven policy and promote more robust democratic practices. 3  Four arguments against allowing noncitizens to vote are that people should accept the duties of citizenship before being allowed to vote that prohibiting noncitizens from voting is not discriminatory that allowing noncitizens to vote would discourage them from seeking citizenship and that allowing them to vote would not benefit society as a whole.  This section details those arguments from a variety of sources arranged by topic. The New York Post editorial board wrote an editorial in response to City Councilman Ydanis Rodriguezs D effort to allow noncitizen residents legally living in the city to vote in local elections. The editorial board argued that noncitizens should have to accept the duties of citizenship before being allowed to vote.  Citizenship should mean something and the right to vote is a big part of it. And while most Americans are born citizens an immigrant s affirmative decision to become a citizen is a vital acceptance of duties as well as privileges.  I absolutely and entirely renounce and abjure all allegiance and fidelity to any foreign prince potentate state or sovereignty reads the oath of allegiance for the newly naturalized. And I will support and defend the Constitution and laws of the United States of America against all enemies foreign and domestic and bear true faith and allegiance to the same including military service and other work of national importance as required by law. 3  U.S. Rep. Jeff Duncan RS.C. introduced a bill in 2019 that would have barred federal funding to states and localities that allow noncitizen voting. In a National Review piece he argued that prohibiting noncitizens from voting is not discriminatory. An alien voluntarily comes to the United States in search of a better life hoping to work and to be part of the American experience a process I support if it s done legally. If they have concerns about what they believe to be discriminatory aspects of our laws they are absolutely free not to come and in the vast majority of cases retain full voting rights in their native countries. The 147 million people in the world who d like to immigrate to the United States and the uptomultidecade greencard backlog suggests to me that the actual practical concerns about discriminatory public policy aren t very serious. The aliens themselves certainly don t think so. 3  Opinion columnist Ross K. Baker argued in USA Today that the right to vote in local elections combined with the benefits some noncitizen immigrants may receive in the state of Maine would disincentivize them from going through the process of becoming citizens.  The right to vote is a component of citizenship. It is not a dispensation granted to those who may or may not apply for citizenship. The benefits of U.S. citizenship are both tangible and intangible but remaining a resident alien is not without its benefits. In addition to federal benefits there is a General Assistance program funded largely by the state immigrants can receive around 800 a month. Unless the emotional urge to pursue citizenship is unusually strong the combination of the social welfare benefits and the right to vote in city elections diminishes the incentive to jump through the hoops required of those who seek to become citizens. 3  Rep. Duncan argued that allowing noncitizens to vote would not benefit society by encouraging public policy that improves conditions for marginalized communities. Finally there s the mutualbenefit argument which suggests that if aliens are allowed to vote then they can make common cause with other marginalized groups in our society and come together for the mutual improvement of our country. This is a classic example of how identity politics erases individuals. Who is to say that a single male alien from Honduras has the same interests as for example a female highschool principal who is an American citizen in a lowincome community? It is just as likely that they have competing interests. The Honduran might be a construction worker and therefore might benefit from reduced taxes on the construction industry while the principal might benefit from increased spending on education. The history of immigration and assimilation is littered with these types of examples. 3  ifdocument.getElementsByClassNamereference.length0 ifdocument.getElementByIdFootnotes!null document.getElementByIdFootnotes.parentNode.style.display none Communications Alison Graves Carley Allensworth Abigail Campbell Sarah Groat Erica ShumakerExternal Relations Andrew Heath Moira Delaney Hannah NelsonOperations Meghann Olshefski Amanda Herbert Mandy Morris Caroline Presnell Kelly RindfleischPolicy Caitlin Styrsky Molly Byrne Jon Dunn Jimmy McAllister Annelise ReinwaldResearch Josh Altic Tech Matt Latourelle Ryan Burch Kirsten Corrao Beth Dellea Travis Eden Tate Kamish Margaret Kearney Eric Lotto Trevor Pollo Joseph Sanchez Ballotpedia features 477486 encyclopedic articles written and curated by our professional staff of editors writers and researchers.
