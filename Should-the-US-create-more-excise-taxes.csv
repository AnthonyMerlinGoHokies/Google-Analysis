After a decade of hard and continuous drinking interspersed with addiction and mental health treatment he could not sustain his recovery. His suicide came on the heels of my mother s death a year before and just weeks later my grandfather died in a car accident. My family s holidays would never be the same. Like so many others who survived the loss of someone dear from the chaos of severe substance use disorder SUD I am too familiar with unspeakable grief. But I have found meaning through it and purpose in passing that on. I was a medical resident when I dropped my brother off at an addiction treatment facility for the first time. Later I became an addiction specialist physician focusing on treating people with SUD and helping them manage their disease and find remission and recovery. My work has taught me something important To help stop the addiction crisis that has brought so much sorrow to families like mine policymakers must prioritize prevention at all levels and support evidencebased prevention initiatives including raising federal excise taxes on alcohol. Experiencing social adversity such as structural inequities and childhood trauma creates vulnerability to behavioral risks for harmful substance use and SUD. My brother who moved from high school to high school due to our many relocations struggled to make lasting friendships. As a freshman he started to use alcohol for entry into teenage social circles. When he was banned from playing football his junior year due to a recruiting regulation it caused a crisis in his young identity. He continued to use alcohol to cope with our mother s illness. Only now do I fully appreciate that my brother did not have the benefit of many of the factors that help protect youth from the harms of alcohol use and the development of alcohol use disorder AUD. Alcoholrelated causes are the nation s fourth leading cause of preventable death. At the federal level policies can be enacted that not only protect our families but also generate significant revenue which can be used to support efforts to increase access to evidencebased addiction treatment. Vastly underutilized levers can deter alcohol use by reducing consumer demand through higher prices. One of these is the federal excise tax on alcoholic beverages which has not been increased since 1991. In 1991 a doubling of the beer tax combined with an increased tax on wine from 17 cents to 1.07 per gallon and on liquor from 12.50 to 13.50 per proof gallon increased alcohol prices by 6 which reduced related injury deaths by 4.7 across the U.S. In highincome countries like ours the inverse relationship between higher prices and drinking prevalence frequency and intensity decreases harms of excessive drinking like car accidents and fatalities deaths from liver cirrhosis alcohol dependence and other diseases caused by excessive drinking crime and violence and workplace accidents. A recent analysis on the World Health Organization European Region which has the highest level of alcohol consumption of all WHO Regions notes there is strong and compelling evidence in Europe that increasing the price of alcoholic beverages through taxation is one of the most effective and costeffective policies used to lower alcoholattributable harm. Just this month WHO released new data on the low rate of global taxes being applied to alcohol and found that the majority of countries are not using taxes to incentivize healthier behavior. To help support those countries WHO is releasing guidance on how to implement alcohol tax policy. A lot has changed in the U.S. since 1991 but federal alcohol taxes have not increased. Because the legislation President George H.W. Bush signed at the time did not index it to inflation alcohol tax rates actually dropped a whopping 36 in the years to 2017. Rates are now surely even lower in real terms given the inflation we ve seen since the beginning of the pandemic a time period which corresponds to a significant rise in alcoholrelated deaths. Though the U.S. has some of the lowest alcohol excise taxes in the OECD in 2020 Congress actually passed federal alcohol excise tax relief. In December 2022 the Congressional Budget Office described promising options for increasing federal excise taxes on alcoholic beverages which could create billions in new federal revenue over nine years. In our country this revenue should be used to build an addiction treatment infrastructure that meets the magnitude of today s crisis and helps to prevent the next one. My young son recently had a profound insight when he told me I think the reason some people use drugs is to steal happiness from tomorrow for today. For my brother he reached a point where his tomorrow had no happiness left. Indeed SUD brings higher risk of dying by suicide and that risk dramatically increases with severity. I would love to tell my kids that our country has taken meaningful steps towards prevention like enacting a higher federal alcohol excise tax to improve and save the lives of people like their uncle. Tax money appropriately allocated to increase treatment funding may have funded access to treatment for my brother who was never offered FDAapproved medications to treat his alcohol use disorder. Increased alcohol costs deter youth who are often opportunistic users. When the cost becomes prohibitive they cannot drink. The smartest thinkers in life sciences on whats happening and whats to come With such overwhelming evidence of the benefits of substance use prevention advancing policy in this area including by increasing the federal alcohol excise tax which is decades overdue will give more people their tomorrows.

https://www.epi.org/blog/bad-tax-or-no-tax-the-aca-excise-tax-debate-continued/, Friend and former colleague Jared Bernstein made a defense of the ACA excise tax on expensive employerprovided health insurance plans a couple of days ago. It s about as good a defense as there is of the excise tax but at EPI we re still largely unconvinced. He provides some arguments on the substance of the tax which I ll briefly touch on below but mostly leans on a political argument that this is a tax that actually exists and given the antitax zealotry of congressional Republicans we should be very leery of giving away any revenue that is currently on the books. Jared and I are roughly on the same page regarding the wagehealth care trade off issue. As the excise tax is imposed on plan costs above a certain threshold this will encourage people to shift into plans with lower upfront premiums. But these lower upfront premiums mean that more health costs are shifted onto households in the form of higher copays deductibles and coinsurance. The good news of lower premiums however is that this frees up money for employers to give more compensation to workers in the form of cash wages rather than health premiums. Elise Gould and I have argued in the past that this wage boost stemming from lessgenerous health plans is likely to be a long time coming particularly if labor markets remain slack. Jared agrees. He argues this trade off likely will happen in the longer run. I agree though I m not 100 percent sure and am troubled by the lack of robust empirical support in the research literature on this. My beef has mostly been with people who simply state that the excise tax will lead to a raise for American workers. That s bunk. It will change the composition not the level of employee compensation. And it will increase total taxes on this compensation hence cutting their takehome pay. We have argued that the real problem with the tax is that the increased cost shifting will indeed cause people to cut back on health care spending but because the American health system is opaque and uncompetitive there will be no good information to tell consumers what they should cut back on first. So they will cut back across the board making decisions that are bad for health and do nothing to boost dollarforvalue in health spending. Recent research provides further confirmation of the destructive impact of the sort of scattershot cost shifting that the excise tax will result in. Jared thinks we overstate this and references the fact that in the beginning years of the tax few plans and fewer health care dollars will be affected. But the tax is designed to grow over time and you can t really claim that this is a vital revenue raiser and then claim that it won t affect many people or many health care dollars. If it s not impacting anybody it is by definition not raising any revenue either. Further if the claim is that the tax really won t do much at all to change people s behavior in consuming health care and hence our concern is exaggerated then Jared is in a sense conceding our point on the lack of any inherent policy virtue of the tax. That is if it does not result in people cutting back on health spending all it s doing is raising revenue and we can then choose an equivalent revenue raiser with fewer problems which would bring us to his political objections which I wrestle with below. Jared references some recent arguments made by excise tax proponents that its imposition will actually not lead to thinner plans with higher copays deductibles and coinsurance. The argument runs that firms and workers will begin pressuring health insurance providers to find efficiencies in insurance and health care provision and obtain lowercost care of equivalent quality through these efficiencies. This really strikes me as magical thinking. If such efficiencies exist today why aren t firms and workers demanding them? Yes the excise tax provides a tiny bit larger incentive to demand these but an awfully big incentive is sitting out there today. A quick example I pay about 10000 each year directly for family health insurance premiums through my employerprovided plan. Does anybody really think I wouldn t really really like to pay less than this? Or does anybody think EPI my employer wouldn t love to lower what it pays in its contribution to health care premiums for employees? What is lacking here is not will or incentive on the part of workers and firms it s a mechanism that links employees and firms desire for cheaper more efficient health care to insurers and providers ability or motivation to provide it. The excise tax doesn t change any of this. In the end the meat of Jared s argument is political we have a tax on the books today Congress is deadlocked by antitax zealots today so we should not give away this precious revenue. It s a good argument. We will eventually almost surely need more revenue to maintain projected spending levels on valuable social insurance programs including the ACA but also Social Security Medicare and Medicaid public investment and generally functional government. But I do think two recent economic developments make the need for revenue less pressing in the nearterm. First health care costgrowth has decelerated significantly over the last decade with the slowdown preceding the Great Recession. This makes the need for more revenue in the mediumterm much less pressing. The projected future budget deficits that are so often breathlessly reported by DC policy types are driven entirely by rising health care costs. As these costs have risen more slowly recently the size of projected future budget deficits has declined as well. Can we bank on tame health care cost growth forever? No but it does buy us time. Second when discussing macroeconomics many of us Jared included I believe take seriously the worry that we ve entered an era where advanced economies may have chronic shortfalls of aggregate demand for years to come. Basically a range of factors rising inequality a global savings glut the declining cost of capital goods who knows what else seem to have conspired to keep households businesses and governments from spending enough to keep the labor force fully employed. In the jargon this is sometimes referred to as secular stagnation. A key policy conclusion from this is that we can and should run larger government deficits than would ve been considered desirable in earlier eras. These deficits spur demand and the traditional downside of deficits run during times when the economy is near fullemployment high and rising interest rates do not materialize. Again will the age of secular stagnation be with us forever? Probably not but this again buys time against when we will need more revenue. And this time is crucially important. Surely we can t make all possible policy decisions today based on the premise that we ll never have a reasonable Congress again. This would argue for striking a deal any deal that preserved any piece of currently scheduled Social Security benefits because under current law more revenue will be needed to keep these benefits from falling significantly 20something years from now. I do wish we weren t debating whether or not to give back some revenue legislated as part of the ACA. But I also wish we had adopted a better revenue source back then. And in some sense the goodfaith debate over a laserfocused change in the excise tax is a healthy normalization of health policy debates. Nobody not even fervent proponents like us thought that the 2010 passage of the ACA solved all U.S. health care problems forevermore. The ACA and Medicare and private insurance will need to be tweaked and adapted in coming years. For the past six years the health care debate has been entirely hijacked by antiACA obsessives in Congress. Having a substantive policy debate driven by people who like the ACA writ large but want a minor course adjustment should be seen as a return to policy normality.

https://taxfoundation.org/taxedu/educational-resources/case-studies-sales-taxes-vs-excise-taxes/, Excise taxes are imposed on a specific good or activity such as cigarettes alcohol and fuel. Because of their narrow base applying a taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local state and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services goods and activities. to a small selection of goods or services excise taxes distort production and consumption choices. Sometimes this distortion is by design. For example a tax on cigarettes to discourage smoking causes a distortion smokers consume less or buy cigarettes elsewhere which can result in the tax being an unreliable longterm revenue source as the tax increases revenue tends to decrease after a brief burst initially. For excise taxes the tax should target the activity or component that causes the most harm or highest societal cost what economists refer to as a negative externalityAn externality in economics terms is a side effect or consequence of an activity that is not reflected in the cost of that activity and not primarily borne by those directly involved in said activity. Externalities can be caused by either production or consumption of a good or service and can be positive or negative.. Examples are the amount of tobacco or alcohol consumed which can lead to increased healthcare costs and burdens and more. Other excise taxes levied in direct connection with the consumption of public goods like gas taxes paying for road usage respect the benefit principle and constitute a user feeA user fee is a charge imposed by the government for the primary purpose of covering the cost of providing a service directly raising funds from the people who benefit from the particular public good or service being provided. A user fee is not a tax though some taxes may be labeled as user fees or closely resemble them. system. For user fees the tax should target the best available proxy for use. Because there is a pretty clear connection between the amount of gasoline consumed and road usage the gas taxA gas tax is commonly used to describe the variety of taxes levied on gasoline at both the federal and state levels to provide funds for highway repair and maintenance as well as for other government infrastructure projects. These taxes are levied in a few ways including pergallon excise taxes excise taxes imposed on wholesalers and general sales taxes that apply to the purchase of gasoline. is a good funding mechanism for the highways. As excise taxes often target a specific product or industry they sometimes pose a smaller risk to the overall economy than increases to broader taxes like the personal income tax or corporate income taxA corporate income tax CIT is levied by federal and state governments on business profits. Many companies are not subject to the CIT because they are taxed as passthrough businesses with income reportable under the individual income tax.. As a result they are often tempting to lawmakers looking for new revenue. However lawmakers should exercise caution. Because they can be very narrow excise taxAn excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or activity. Excise taxes are commonly levied on cigarettes alcoholic beverages soda gasoline insurance premiums amusement activities and betting and typically make up a relatively small and volatile portion of state and local and to a lesser extent federal tax collections. hikes By itself the fact that some excise taxes have regressive effects is no argument against levying them but the effect does illustrate one tradeoff of relying too heavily on excise taxes for revenue generation. General tax revenues should come from more stable broadbased consumption taxes like the general sales taxA sales tax is levied on retail sales of goods and services and ideally should apply to all final consumption with few exemptions. Many governments exempt goods like groceries base broadening such as including groceries could keep rates lower. A sales tax should exempt businesstobusiness transactions which when taxed cause tax pyramiding. imposed at the statelevel on the retail sales of goods and services in the U.S. Ideally sales taxes are imposed on all final sales of goods and services but not on intermediate businesstobusiness transactions in the production chain as in the case of gross receipts taxes GRT. Sales taxes are less distortive than capital and income taxes because they do not affect decisions to work or invest and when appropriately structured they do not lead to tax pyramidingTax pyramiding occurs when the same final good or service is taxed multiple times along the production process. This yields vastly different effective tax rates depending on the length of the supply chain and disproportionately harms lowmargin firms. Gross receipts taxes are a prime example of tax pyramiding in action.. States rightly tend to rely on general sales tax revenues to a much larger degree than on revenue from excise taxes.  All tax revenue is subject to economic cycles and changing taxpayer behavior but broadbased consumption taxes experience considerably less volatility than excise taxes that change depending on consumer preference technological development or regulatory intervention. In most states cigarette tax hikes are met with a momentary bump in revenue followed by a dropoff in future years. Conversely one of the advantages of a broadbased consumption taxA consumption tax is typically levied on the purchase of goods or services and is paid directly or indirectly by the consumer in the form of retail sales taxes excise taxes tariffs valueadded taxes VAT or an income tax where all savings is taxdeductible. is its stability. Most excise taxes are by definition not neutral. Many are designed to impact specific industries and decisions made by consumers to increase costs and lower consumption. Broadbased consumption taxes that apply to all final consumption like a sales tax are neutral because they have little effect on consumer behavior and apply to all business models the same. However no such tax exists today as many states would tax a good but not the services associated with that good. Sales taxes that capture intermediate business activity are less neutral because the total tax burden multiplies throughout the production chain disadvantaging certain industries especially those with long supply chains. A sales tax may also lack transparency if it applies to business inputs. Products with longer production chains are taxed more and the overall burden of the tax ends up hidden in the final price of goods. That said wellstructured broadbased state sales taxes are relatively transparent consumers can clearly see their tax burden printed at the bottom of their receipts. Excise taxes are generally less transparent as they are often levied early in the value chain and built into the price when the good moves through the chain. They are however specific when levied on quantity making them fairly transparent. For example the tax on 20 cigarettes is always the same within the state. Excise tax simplicity can vary depending on how the tax is applied. For example tobacco taxes levied based on quantities tend to be simpler than those based on price. State sales taxes are typically simple as the same tax is levied across the purchase of most goods. Sales taxes become less simple with the addition of exemptions for certain goods like groceries and with sales tax holidays. The viability of either tax policy is dependent on the purpose of the tax though sales taxes tend to be more stable tax policy and a better source of revenue. Despite declining sales tax revenues over the past few decades this is not a symptom of the tax type itself but rather the fact that sales tax bases have historically been designed to exclude services. Sales tax revenues have fallen even coupled with increased rates as the economy has shifted from goodsbased to servicebased. General sales taxes tend to be the better policy for both the taxpayer and the government. The sales tax provides a more stable source of revenue because the tax targets a wide tax baseThe tax base is the total amount of income property assets consumption transactions or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is nonneutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates.. Conversely cigarette taxes are aimed at a narrow base and are often designed to curb the use of tobacco products creating an unstable revenue stream. Sales taxes account for almost onethird of all state tax revenue second only to individual income taxes 36 percent in their contribution to state receipts. Reliance on sales taxes however ranges from a low of less than 16 percent in Vermont neglecting the five states which do not impose statelevel sales taxes to a high of nearly 68 percent in Texas. Five states Alaska Delaware Montana New Hampshire and Oregon do not levy statelevel sales taxes. State reliance on sales tax depends on its mix of other taxes Texas for instance forgoes income taxes while Vermont has highrate income taxes its sales tax rate and importantly the breadth of its sales tax base. Expanding sales tax bases improves neutrality. Newly generated revenues can then be used to finance general fund programs or other tax reforms including paying down reductions in the sales tax rate. One option to broaden the base is to expand sales taxes beyond taxing goods into taxing services as well. While some states have attempted this expansion many still focus the sales tax on the purchase of tangible goods. This could include services like lawn care streaming services or home repairs. In almost any state you look at cigarette excise tax increases result in a burst of revenue followed by a steep decline as the tax does what it is intended to do reduce cigarette purchases.  Governments should remain cautious when forecasting excise revenue. Revenue generation can be impacted by changes in technology consumer preference or total tax burden. The impact of the tax burden is most visible in the cigarette market where a substantial black market offers untaxed or lowtax products primarily in areas with high taxes. Moreover cigarette consumption is a market in longterm decline. Below are some resources regarding sales and tobacco taxes and their impact from Tax Foundation and other sources. Please conduct additional research on the case prior to discussion. Local income taxes in Maryland constitute about 35 percent of local tax collections and more than 17 percent of local revenue giving Maryland s localities the highest dependence on income taxes in the nation.  This web tool allows taxpayers to see how cigarette tax revenues have changed since 1955. Across almost all states a clear pattern of volatility emerges.

https://taxfoundation.org/blog/federal-excise-taxes-proper-role/, As the federal government looks to pass an extenders package various excise taxAn excise tax is a tax imposed on a specific good or activity. Excise taxes are commonly levied on cigarettes alcoholic beverages soda gasoline insurance premiums amusement activities and betting and typically make up a relatively small and volatile portion of state and local and to a lesser extent federal tax collections. provisions are on the table. Excise taxes are placed on specific products or activities instead of on a general taxA tax is a mandatory payment or charge collected by local state and national governments from individuals or businesses to cover the costs of general government services goods and activities. base like income or sales. Because excise taxes disproportionately burden lowincome people lawmakers should use excise taxes properly. Excise taxes can be used to price an externalityAn externality in economics terms is a side effect or consequence of an activity that is not reflected in the cost of that activity and not primarily borne by those directly involved in said activity. Externalities can be caused by either production or consumption of a good or service and can be positive or negative. or discourage consumption of a product that imposes costs on others. They can also be employed as a user feeA user fee is a charge imposed by the government for the primary purpose of covering the cost of providing a service directly raising funds from the people who benefit from the particular public good or service being provided. A user fee is not a tax though some taxes may be labeled as user fees or closely resemble them. to generate revenue from people who use particular government services revenue which should be used to maintain that government service. When a consumer buys a product they do not necessarily consider how using that product might impact others. In economics this impact is called an externality. For example if a person buys a pack of cigarettes they may not consider that the negative impact on their health could drive up the cost of health care for others. An excise tax can function as a method to recoup some of the cost of this externality as the revenue can fund increased Medicare or Medicaid costs. In this way an excise tax can more accurately price a product to reflect the costs that its use imposes on society. The role of excise taxes as a user fee is best understood in the context of a gas taxA gas tax is commonly used to describe the variety of taxes levied on gasoline at both the federal and state levels to provide funds for highway repair and maintenance as well as for other government infrastructure projects. These taxes are levied in a few ways including pergallon excise taxes excise taxes imposed on wholesalers and general sales taxes that apply to the purchase of gasoline.. The more you drive the more you use governmentfunded roads. The federal gas tax acts as an estimation of how much a person is using these roads and charges them a user fee according to the amount of gasoline they consume. While there are issues with using gas as a proxy for road use think electric cars variances in fuel efficiency or alternative uses for gasoline the gas tax and other user fee excise taxes can be a noninvasive method to approximate how much a person utilizes government services and target frequent users for funding. Excise taxes affect people differently across the income spectrum. As visualized in the graphs below the distribution of federal excise taxes is regressive. In 2016 the top 1 percent of earners faced an average effective federal excise tax rate of 0.2 percent while the bottom 20 percent of earners faced a rate of 1.8 percent. While highincome earners will pay more excise taxes in dollar terms the extra cost makes up a lower portion of their overall spending.

A small increase in price will have the least effect on heavy consumers as their demand is more inelastic or less affected by changes in price. In response to a tax increase a heavy smoker might choose to smoke one fewer cigarette over the course of a day but probably won t quit entirely. Additionally the tax baseThe tax base is the total amount of income property assets consumption transactions or other economic activity subject to taxation by a tax authority. A narrow tax base is nonneutral and inefficient. A broad tax base reduces tax administration costs and allows more revenue to be raised at lower rates. of some excise taxes tends to be narrow and inaccurately targeted. For example if an excise tax on soda is justified by its high sugar content then the tax should be on sugar in general to account for 1 other products with high sugar content and 2 the variable amount of sugar and affiliated cost to society in different sodas. Aiming for the broadest base possible when designing excise taxes would allow for a lower rate lowering their burden on lowincome taxpayers. In effect a higher price can act as a proxy for information allowing a person to make a more informed decision while paying for the impact their choice imposes on others. By understanding excise taxes as user fees or a price on externalities lawmakers can more effectively achieve policy goals while minimizing the impact of regressive taxA regressive tax is one where the average tax burden decreases with income. Lowincome taxpayers pay a disproportionate share of the tax burden while middle and highincome taxpayers shoulder a relatively small tax burden.es.

A typical developing economy collects just 15 percent of GDP in taxes compared with the 40 percent collected by a typical advanced economy. The ability to collect taxes is central to a country s capacity to finance social services such as health and education critical infrastructure such as electricity and roads and other public goods. Considering the vast needs of poor countries this low level of tax collection is putting economic development at risk. How can policymakers tackle this challenge? A look at successful reforms between 2004 and 2015 in five lowincome and emerging market economies which achieved some of the largest revenue gains after tax reform offers some answers. The experiences of this diverse set of countries Cambodia Georgia Guyana Liberia and Ukraine show that regardless of the constraints they face countries can strengthen their capacity to collect tax revenue by pursuing reform strategies with certain distinct features. We focus here mainly on Georgia. By analyzing what worked in that country we can draw lessons for what strategies other countries should consider. Georgia offers a striking example of successful tax revenue reform. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union the government struggled to collect tax revenue. By 2003 rampant corruption involving tax evasion illegal tax credits and theft of government tax revenue had left public finances in shambles. The government was no longer able to honor its obligations to public servants and pensioners even though salaries and pensions were very low.  Georgia s sweeping tax reform was made possible after the 2003 Rose Revolution which gave the new government a mandate to reform the economy and fight widespread corruption. The country s new leaders adopted a policy of zero tolerance for corruption and the culture began to change along with the laws. A revised tax code passed in 2004 simplified the tax system reduced rates and eliminated a series of minor local taxes that had been generating little revenue on pollution and gambling for example. Only 7 of 21 taxes remained and many of the rates were reduced. Progressive personal income tax rates 12 to 20 percent were replaced with a flat rate of 20 percent and the social security contribution tax rate was first reduced from 33 percent to 20 percent and then eliminated altogether. Corporate income was taxed at a flat rate of 15 percent and the valueadded tax VAT was reduced from 20 percent to 18 percent. The revenue lost from lower tax rates was made up through a broader tax base better compliance and stricter enforcement. The government also made it easier to pay taxes by introducing measures such as an electronic tax filing system. In this way technology both improved efficiency and reduced opportunities for corruption. In parallel the government lowered the minimum capital required to start a business which also generated more tax revenue.  The improvement in the country s ability to mobilize revenue between 2004 and 2011 is all the more impressive given the sharp reduction in tax rates. By 2008 Georgia s taxrevenuetoGDP ratio had doubled to 25 percent. What does Georgia s experience teach us about how best to increase tax revenue? While there is no onesizefitsall solution there are a few lessons that can be drawn from Georgia s case as well as the experiences of the other four countries. Have a clear mandate. Governments with a clear mandate to reform the tax system often succeed. Georgia s comprehensive tax reform was feasible only after the country had reached a high degree of dysfunction triggering a revolution. Similarly in Ukraine the 2004 Orange Revolution was a catalyst for tax reform. And in 2003 Liberia initiated reform after the civil war had ended. Secure highlevel political commitment and buyin from all stakeholders. While a clear mandate is necessary it is not sufficient. Many newly elected governments do have such a mandate but not all of them reform. Therefore political commitment at the highest level and broad buyin are needed. Social dialogue enhances the likelihood of reforms being implemented and sustained. Effective communication with stakeholders that emphasizes the intended benefits of reforms can help overcome resistance of vested interests. And compensating the losers has proved effective in winning public support for tax reform initiatives. Simplify the tax system and curb exemptions. A simpler tax system with a limited number of rates is critical to fostering taxpayer compliance as seen in the Georgia example. Notably in fragile states focus first on simplifying taxes procedures and structures. Simplicity of the tax system and legislation is the guiding principle for fragile states. This makes tax administration less challenging in weak states that lack such basic institutions as security and a wellfunctioning judicial system. Liberia is a case in point. Following its emergence from civil war Liberia introduced taxes on turnover or import values such as the goods and services tax excises and customs tariffs underpinned by simple tax legislation.  Curbing exemptions can also reduce the tax system s complexity while boosting revenue by broadening the tax base. Many countries incur a sizable loss of revenue through illdesigned exemptions such as costly tax holidays and other incentives that fail to attract investment. And discretionary granting of exemptions provides opportunities for corruption.  Reducing exemptions figured prominently in nearly all five countries. Guyana for example implemented a comprehensive exemption reform with main elements that included eliminating the power of the finance minister to grant discretionary exemptions publishing exemptions annually and limiting income tax holidays to every 5 or 10 years depending on the sector. Reform indirect taxes on goods and services. The VAT has proved to be an efficient and strong revenue booster countries that impose this tax tend to raise more revenue than those that don t Keen and Lockwood 2010. In addition to reducing the rate Georgia streamlined its VAT refund mechanism allowing revenue from this source to rise from 8.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to about 11.5 percent in 2009. Guyana successfully introduced a VAT on January 1 2007 despite significant challenges in the preparatory work including setting up the new VAT department with fully trained staff putting in place the supporting IT system and procedures and training potential registrants and practitioners. The VAT was broadbased with a single rate of 16 percent and a limited number of exemptions for financial medical and educational services. As part of its reform Ukraine also curbed VAT exemptions and revised the regime for agriculture by reducing the rate and eliminating refunds. Increases in excise and sales taxes are the simplest measures because they can raise revenue fairly quickly without fundamental changes to the tax system. For example Guyana in 2015 took advantage of the decline in the international price of oil to raise fuel excise taxes. This step buoyed revenue during the country s economic slowdown. Similarly Liberia broadened the scope of its goods and services tax while raising excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes. Introduce comprehensive tax administration reforms. Successful revenue mobilization cases tend to take a more holistic approach to modernizing tax institutions. In all five case studies revenue administration reforms figured prominently and covered a broad spectrum of legal technical and administrative measures such as Management governance and human resources Four of the five countries implemented some management and governance changes. Georgia gradually recruited new tax and customs officers and phased out the old ones as part of its anticorruption reform.  Establishment of large taxpayer offices A large taxpayer office allows a country to focus tax compliance efforts on the biggest taxpayers as Cambodia has done. These offices also support good tax administration they often pilot new tax and customs procedures before their rollout to the broader population.  Smart use of information management systems Successful revenue mobilization hinges on managing information and leveraging the power of big data to improve compliance and fight corruption. Most of the countries studied have taken advantage of IT systems to leapfrog their revenue mobilization reforms. Georgia has automated most processes including efiling. It has also instituted a system for information sharing among tax authorities taxpayers and banks as well as a onestop Internet portal. Cambodia Guyana and Liberia have likewise computerized the administration of their taxes and customs. More modern registration filing and management of payment obligations All five countries have sought to establish or modernize basic rules and processes in these key compliance areas. For instance Guyana implemented a unique system of taxpayer identification numbers and streamlined its process. It also introduced income tax withholding a measure critical to fostering compliance.  Enhanced audit and verification program A riskbased audit which links the likelihood and nature of an audit to the taxpayer s inherent risks is the most effective type in terms of encouraging compliance. All five countries have made this a key part of their revenue mobilization strategy. Notably Cambodia conducted riskbased audits of taxpayers at customs and of the 150 largest taxpayers and hired some 200 new auditors. Ukraine implemented a targeted audit program improved the internal control of tax administration fought fraudulent VAT claims and developed an antismuggling program at the customs office.  Although the optimal timing and design of reform measures vary among countries these five cases highlight some basic lessons. One such lesson is that countries that pursue revenue administration measures and tax policy reform in tandem tend to see much larger gains.  But countries must give tax reform time to bear fruit. The duration of the reform episodes ranged from two to seven years. Sustained success requires institutional change which happens only gradually.  The revenue increase in each of the five countries was impressive and averaged at least 1 percent of GDP a year over the reform period see chart. This is consistent with the quantitative tax revenue objective over the four to sixyear time horizon recently advocated by the IMF s Vitor Gaspar and Abebe Selassie. In Georgia the revenue gains averaged 2.5 percent of GDP a year as was the case in Ukraine. Moreover all five countries sustained the revenue gains in the five years after the reform episodes confirming the quality of the measures put in place.  These five cases clearly show that large tax revenue mobilization can be achieved and sustained. Although reform must be tailored to individual circumstances three lessons stand out tax reform requires first and foremost a broad social and political commitment it rests on broadbased strategies that recognize that what and whom to tax should go hand in hand with how to tax and it should be developed with the longer view in mind.

https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/who-bears-burden-federal-excise-taxes, A citizen s guide to the fascinating though often complex elements of the US tax system. Workers owners of capital and households that consume a disproportionate amount of taxed items all bear the burden of federal excise taxes. Excise taxes create a wedge between the price the final consumer pays and what the producer receives. An excise can raise the total price inclusive of the excise tax consumers pay reduce the aftertax revenue available to compensate workers and investors or both. The burden of an excise can be separated into two pieces 1 the reduction in real household income which equals the gross revenue generated by the excise tax and 2 the increase in the price of the taxed good or service relative to the prices of other goods and services which depends on the mix of consumption by each household. Importantly the decline in real income is the same regardless of whether nominal incomes fall holding the price level constant or the price level rises holding nominal incomes constant. The reduction in real income is spread across wages profits and other returns to labor and capital but excludes the normal return to savings that represents the reward for deferring consumption to a future year. The reduction in wages in turn reduces both individual income taxes and payroll taxes. Likewise the reduction in profits reduces corporate income taxes and individual income taxes on the profits of passthrough business like partnerships and other returns to capital. These excise tax offsets amount to about 22 percent of excise tax revenues and are considered in distributional analyses. An excise tax also increases the price of the taxed good or service relative to the prices of all other goods and services. While the price of the taxed item rises the prices of all other items may either remain unchanged as the overall price level rises or fall slightly if the price level remains unchanged. Either way this change in relative prices burdens households that consume a largerthanaverage share of the taxed item. However households that consume a smallerthanaverage share of the taxed item or do not consume it at all benefit from this change in relative prices. This still leaves open the timing of the tax burden that is whether the burden is assigned when income is earned or when it is consumed. Some distributional analyses follow the latter approach and distribute excise taxes in proportion to current levels of consumption. Alternative analyses assign the burden based on current income. Under the incomebased approach one can think of excise taxes as a reduction in purchasing power at the point income is earned. Of course if all households fully consumed their income in each year the two methods would yield identical results. The UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center distributes the burden of an excise tax when income is earned taking into account the offset and the relative price effect. The US Department of the Treasury s Office of Tax Analysis as described in Cronin 1999 distributes excise taxes in the same manner. The Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office however distribute the entire burden of excises in proportion to consumption of the taxed goods and services. While the share of federal excise tax paid rises with income federal excises are regressive. That is the average federal excise tax rate the excise tax burden as a percentage of pretax income declines as income rises. The average excise tax rate falls from 0.6 percent in the bottom quintile to 0.4 in highest quintile and to 0.3 percent of income in the top 1 percent table 1. Each quintile contains 20 percent of the population ranked by income. Federal excise taxes also account for a larger share of the total federal tax burden including individual and corporate income taxes payroll taxes the estate tax and excise taxes for lowerincome groups than for higherincome groups. In the bottom two quintiles excise taxes are the secondlargest source of the total federal tax burden behind payroll taxes. Those income groups have negative average income tax rates resulting from refundable income tax credits. Federal excise tax revenues totaled 88 billion in fiscal year 2022 or 2 percent of total federal tax revenues. Five categories of excise taxes highway tobacco air travel health and alcohol account for 90 percent of total federal excise tax receipts. The distributional burden varies somewhat across the different categories of excise taxes table 2. The tobacco excise tax for example has the least varying share of taxes paid across income quintiles. The bottom quintile pays 16 percent of tobacco taxes while the top quintile pays 27 percent of tobacco taxes compared to over 45 percent of other excises. Tobacco taxes are the most regressive of the major federal excise taxes. The remaining categories differ only modestly from each other. Excise taxes on air travel are tilted relatively more towards higherincome households with 53 percent paid by households in the top income quintile. Congressional Budget Office.
