https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_hearings_of_the_United_States_House_Select_Committee_on_the_January_6_Attack, A series of televised congressional investigations by the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack about events related to the January 6 United States Capitol attack ran from 2021 to January 2023. In July 2021 the House Select Committee held a preliminary public hearing about the law enforcement experience during the mob violence on that day. 1 2 3  In 2022 the Committee held ten live televised public hearings 4 that presented evidence of Trumps sevenpart plan to overturn the 2020 elections this included live interviews under oath of many Republicans and some Trump loyalists 5 6 as well as recorded sworn deposition testimony and video footage from other sources. An Executive Summary 7 of the committees findings was published on December 19 2022 a Final Report 8 was published on December 22 2022. 9  During the first hearing on June 9 2022 committee chair Bennie Thompson and vicechair Liz Cheney said that President Donald Trump tried to stay in power even though he lost the 2020 presidential election. Thompson called it a coup. 10 The committee shared footage of the attack discussed the involvement of the Proud Boys and included testimony from a documentary filmmaker and a member of the Capitol Police. The second hearing on June 13 2022 focused on evidence showing that Trump knew he lost and that most of his inner circle knew claims of fraud did not have merit. William Barr testified that Trump had become detached from reality because he continued to promote conspiracy theories and pushed the stolen election myth without interest in what the actual facts were. 11 12  The third hearing on June 16 2022 examined how Trump and others pressured Vice President Mike Pence to selectively discount electoral votes and overturn the election by unconstitutional means using John Eastmans fringe legal theories as justification. 13  The fourth hearing on June 21 2022 included appearances by election officials from Arizona and Georgia who testified they were pressured to find votes for Trump and change results in their jurisdictions. The committee revealed attempts to organize fake slates of alternate electors and established that Trump had a direct and personal role in this effort. 14 15  The fifth hearing on June 23 2022 focused on Trumps pressure campaign on the Justice Department to rubber stamp his narrative of a stolen election the insistence on numerous debunked election fraud conspiracy theories requests to seize voting machines and Trumps effort to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general. 16  The exclusive witness of the sixth hearing on June 28 2022 was Cassidy Hutchinson top aide to former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows. 17 She testified that White House officials anticipated violence days in advance of January 6 that Trump knew supporters at the Ellipse rally were armed with weapons including AR15s yet asked to relax security checks at his speech and that Trump planned to join the crowd at the Capitol and became irate when the Secret Service refused his request. Closing the hearing Cheney presented evidence of witness tampering. 18  The seventh hearing on July 12 2022 showed how Roger Stone and Michael Flynn connected Trump to domestic militias like the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys that helped coordinate the attack. 19 20 21  The eighth hearing on July 21 2022 presented evidence and details of Trumps refusal to call off the attack on the Capitol despite hours of pleas from officials and insiders. According to the New York Times the committee delivered two significant public messages Rep. Liz Cheney made the case that Trump could never be trusted with any position of authority in our great nation again while Rep. Bennie Thompson called for legal accountability and stiff consequences to overcome the ongoing threat to our democracy. 22  The ninth hearing on October 13 2022 23 24 presented video of Roger Stone and evidence that some Trump associates planned to claim victory in the 2020 election regardless of the official results. 25 26 The committee voted unanimously to subpoena Trump for documents and testimony 27 28 and a subpoena was issued one week later. 29 Trump refused to comply. 30  The tenth hearing on December 19 2022 convened to present a final overview of their investigative work to date and the committee recommended that former President Donald Trump John Eastman and others be referred for legal charges. The committee also recommended that the House Ethics Committee follow up on Rep. Kevin McCarthy CA Rep. Jim Jordan OH Scott Perry PA and Andy Biggs AZ refusing to answer subpoenas. 31 The votes were unanimous. 32 Immediately after the hearing the committee released a 154page executive summary of its findings. 33 34 35  Early in the investigation the committee held a preliminary hearing in 2021. It was only carried by CSPAN and not widely covered on broadcast television. 3 In June 2022 the committee held highly publicized hearings intended for live broadcast. 36 As used by the committee labels such as first hearing second hearing et cetera refers to this series of televised hearings.  The committee publicly voted on December 19 2022 37 to make criminal referrals for Donald Trump and John Eastman to the DOJ and ethics referrals for four members of Congress Representatives McCarthy Jordan Biggs and Perry to the House Ethics Committee. 38 The news had previously identified Mark Meadows Jeffrey Clark and Rudy Giuliani as likely to be referred. 39 40 The committee released its final report on December 22 which became a bestseller. On January 6 2021 Donald Trumps attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election culminated in a mob of Trumps supporters attacking the Capitol Building in Washington D.C. 65 The House of Representatives passed a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack modeled after the 911 Commission but it failed due to a filibuster by Republicans in the Senate. 66 The House then formed a select committee led by seven Democrats and two Republicans. 67 The hearings are part of the select committees investigation. In advance of the hearings congressional Republicans including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy began to organize themselves to defend Trump. This messaging presented a challenge for them in part because they did not know in advance what information the committee would reveal at the hearings. 68 69 McCarthy spoke to donors on the morning of the second hearing advising Republicans to ignore the proceedings refuse public comment and avoid the topic. He suggested their party should instead discuss election issues that could garner more votes such as focusing on rising inflation or fuel prices. Insiders have said former president Trump was not necessarily pleased with this strategy and felt there was no one to defend him. 70  On July 27 2021 the committee held a hearing titled The Law Enforcement Experience on January 6th 2021. 42 71  According to CSPAN January 6 Committee Meeting with Capitol and D.C. Police Capitol and District of Columbia police testified at the first hearing of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. Witnesses described their experiences on that day and efforts to protect the Capitol and elected officials. Throughout the hearing graphic video footage captured during the attack was shown. 72  The four officers Dunn Fanone Gonell and Hodges were given a frontrow seat to all of the committees public hearings in 2022. 73 All four along with others received the Presidential Citizens Medal from Joe Biden on January 6 2023. 74  This was the first of the hearings for broadcast on live television and was held during prime time. The committee showed neverbeforeseen footage of the Capitol attack to provide an accessible and compelling narrative of events for the public. 87  The committee panel observed that Donald Trump attempted to overturn a free and fair democratic election by promoting a sevenpart conspiracy. 88 89 According to Bennie Thompson chairman of the committee Jan. 6 was the culmination of an attempted coup a brazen attempt as one rioter put it shortly after Jan. 6 to overthrow the government ... The violence was no accident. It represents Trumps last stand most desperate chance to halt the transfer of power. According to the committee Trump lied to the American people ignored all evidence refuting his false fraud claims pressured state and federal officials to throw out election results favoring his challenger encouraged a violent mob to storm the Capitol and even signaled support for the execution of his own vice president. 88 89  Panel members made reference to a federal district court opinion in which the Judge David O. Carter said Trump had likely violated two federal statutes and staged a coup in search of a legal theory. 90 91 Rep Liz Cheney read part of the opinion in which the court said If Dr. Eastman and President Trumps plan had worked it would have permanently ended the peaceful transition of power undermining American democracy and the Constitution. If the country does not commit to investigating and pursuing accountability for those responsible the Court fears January 6 willrepeat itself. 92  Cheney urged all Americans to read the opinion in full. Cheney said Trumps efforts were part of a sophisticated sevenpart plan which the committee hearings would establish. 93  A written version of the above plan was released after the hearing. 94 95  Many in Trumps inner circle informed the president he had lost and there was no evidence of widespread fraud. According to several video clips of prior testimony shown by the committee Cheney observed White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his team of lawyers had threatened to resign in response to an increasingly hostile climate of lawless activity within the Oval Office. Another video clip was then shown in which Jared Kushner characterized Cipollones concerns as whining. During his testimony Kushner claimed that his primary interest at that time was to complete as many presidential pardons as possible. 98 Cheney also said that Representative Scott Perry and other Republican members of Congress had sought Presidential pardons for their roles in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. 44  The committee showed video much of it never before seen by the public of the mob charging the Capitol and battling police. The video began with scenes of roughly 200 Proud Boys leading the assault on the Capitol. As later scenes showed a violent rampage audio was overlaid of Trump later saying The love in the air. Ive never seen anything like it. As the attack lasted several hours the video contained timestamps to illustrate the timeline. 99 Documentary filmmaker Nick Quested provided testimony during the live hearing he was embedded with the Proud Boys on January 6. Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards also testified live and inperson she was seriously injured 100 on January 6 while defending the Capitol against initial attacks by Proud Boys and during the mob violence that followed. 101  Quested testified that he joined the Proud Boys at the National Mall at 1030 a.m. saying I dont know if violence was a plan but I do know that they werent there to attend the rally because they had already left the rally by the time the president had started his speech. According to Quested they then walked around the Capitol while taking some pictures and observed a sole police officer at the barricades by the Peace Circle. 44 After suggesting the Proud Boys were doing reconnaissance to spot security weaknesses Chairman Thompson observed that the Proud Boys chose that barricade and breached it at about the same time President Trump directed the rally attendees to march to that same location. He then said  Now a central question is whether the attack on the Capitol was coordinated and planned. What you witnessed is what a coordinated and planned effort would look like. It was the culmination of a months long effort spearheaded by President Trump. 44  Officer Edwards who had sustained multiple injuries during the attack testified that the group of Proud Boys who first approached the police barricades began by shouting rhetoric to turn the police into villains and then began their assault. She described in detail her experiences and injuries as police fell back. When asked what she remembers most vividly Edwards described moving from an area with a relatively small field of view to one where she had her first view of the events unfolding before the Western Terrace. When I fell behind that line and I saw I can just remember my my breath catching in my throat because what I saw was just a a war scene. It was something like Id seen out of the movies. I I couldnt believe my eyes. There were officers on the ground. You know they were bleeding. They were throwing up ... Never in my wildest dreams did I think that as a police officer as a law enforcement officer I would find myself in the middle of a battle. You know I Im trained to detain you know a couple of subjects and and handle you know handle a crowd but I Im not combat trained. 44  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley in videotaped testimony said the White House encouraged him to claim that Trump had ordered the National Guard to respond on January 6 even though it was Pence who in fact gave the order. 97 Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted on January 6 that former President Trump had directed the National Guard to respond. 102 The reasons that the White House attempted to falsely credit Trump for National Guard mobilization remains unclear. 103  It was always known that Pence gave the order. Acting Defense Secretary Christopher C. Miller had publicly stated so on the day of the attack. As a result CNN later questioned whether Pence was acting as commander in chief. 102 Miller gave similar testimony to Congress on May 12 2021 before the House select committee was formed. 104  The second televised hearing concentrated on both how and why Trump and surrogates spread false claims of voter fraud in various jurisdictions proliferated following the 2020 United States presidential election. Former U.S. attorney for the Northern District of Georgia B.J. Pak testified. Pak resigned from his position days before the January 6 attack he later told the Senate Judiciary Committee that the White House informed him Trump would fire him if he did not publicly state his office had found election fraud in Georgia. 131 132  Chris Stirewalt a former Fox News politics editor testified. Fox News was the first network to declare Biden as having won Arizona in the 2020 election Stirewalt testified that as the vote count wrapped up he saw Trumps statistical chances of winning shrink to essentially zero. After Stirewalt defended that journalistic choice Fox News fired him in January 2021. 133 134  Al Schmidt the Republican former city commissioner of Philadelphia testified. He had drawn Trumps ire for refusing to publicly announce the citys election results were rife with fraud. He resigned in 2021 saying he had received death threats. 131  Ben Ginsberg a longterm Republican election attorney involved in the controversial Bush v. Gore litigation testified as an expert about why Trumps election lawsuits failed. 135  Bill Stepien was subpoenaed to testify but his wife went into labor and he canceled his appearance 133 his attorney was then to have read a statement on his behalf but did not. 136 Stepien is a longtime Republican operative who joined Trumps 2016 campaign later becoming the White House political director before becoming Trumps campaign manager two months before the 2020 election. He was involved in the Stop the Steal effort including spreading false information about voting machines despite a staff memo finding the allegations were false. Stepien had provided the committee a deposition under subpoena in December 2021. 137 138 The Select Committee made ten video clips of Stepiens deposition available following the meeting. 109 110 111 112 113 114 115 116 117 118  The Select Committee showed several video clips of White House and Trump campaign insiders patly dismissing claims of voter fraud. The third televised hearing examined how Trump and others pressured Vice President Mike Pence to overturn the election results. Pence himself was not present at the hearing and did not offer video testimony. 13  J. Michael Luttig a longtime Republican who had clerked for Antonin Scalia and Warren Burger before becoming a federal appeals court judge testified inperson. 169 Had Pence obeyed the orders from his president it would have been tantamount to a revolution within a constitutional crisis he said. 170  Before the hearing Luttig wrote a statement for the record that Trump and his allies instigated a war on democracy so that he could cling to power. He continued It is breathtaking that these arguments even were conceived let alone entertained by the President of the United States at that perilous moment in history and that January 6 was the final fateful day for the execution of a welldeveloped plan by the former president to overturn the 2020 presidential election at any cost. On the day before the Capitol attack Luttig had at the request of Pences aides publicly opined that the vice president had no constitutional authority to intervene in the election certification which Pence cited in his January 6 letter stating he would not intervene. 171 172  Greg Jacob former counsel to Pence testified inperson. He had advised Pence he did not have the authority to overturn the election results. 13 In his legal opinion he said those who wrote the Constitution wouldnt have put it in the hands of one person to determine who would be the president of the United States. 170 He also said that John Eastman had told him privately that he didnt expect a single Supreme Court Justice would support the validity of the fake electors scheme. 173  A video was shown of testimony by Marc Short former Pence chief of staff. 170 According to Short Pence knew he had no legal authority to overturn the election and had said so many times to Trump. 174  Former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann had told the committee that Rudy Giuliani privately admitted on the morning of January 6 that Pence didnt have authority to overturn the election even though Giuliani gave a speech at the Ellipse that afternoon telling the opposite to the crowd. Herschmanns videotaped testimony was publicly revealed for the first time. 175  According to a timeline presented by the committee by 210 pm the Capitol had been breached and the mob began swarming in. Trump became aware of the breach and at 224 pm tweeted Mike Pence didnt have the courage to do what was necessary. The committee revealed that the mob some chanting hang Mike Pence came within 40 feet 12 m of the vice president as he was evacuated from his office to an underground loading dock. Greg Jacob testified the Secret Service instructed Pence and his aides to get in cars which most did Pence declined and the head of his security detail assured the vice president he would not be evacuated from the Capitol without his permission. Pence responded that he knew and trusted his security chief but that he was not the one driving the car. Jacob said Pence did not want the world seeing him fleeing and giving the insurgents any satisfaction from it. Pence then spent the next five hours in a secure underground location within the Capitol Building complex. The Department of Justice spoke to a confidential witness who traveled to Washington with the Proud Boys and swore under oath that they would have killed Pence and Speaker Nancy Pelosi if given the chance. 176 170 177  The committee alleged that Eastman was aware his coup memo and other legal recommendations and political activities were potentially criminal. He emailed Trumps former attorney Rudy Giuliani several days after the attack on the Capitol saying Ive decided I should be on the pardon list if that is still in the works but he did not receive a pardon. 170 During his taped deposition he pleaded the Fifth 100 times reserving the right to avoid selfincrimination and refused to answer any questions regarding his participation in the attempts to overturn the 2020 election. 178 179  Donald Trump and his allies and supporters are a clear and present danger to American democracy. They would attempt to overturn that 2024 election in the same way that they attempted to overturn the 2020 election but succeed in 2024 where they failed in 2020. I dont speak those words lightly. I would have never spoken those words ever in my life except that thats what the former president and his allies are telling us ... that they are executing that blueprint for 2024 in the open in plain view of the American public. 180 181  The fourth televised hearing examined a scheme to refuse and return certified Biden elector slates back to seven key states which had Republicancontrolled legislatures. 182 183 Leveraging the false allegations of election fraud it was at Trumps direct request that the RNC assisted by organizing the fake slates of electors for Pence to certify. 15 The scheme promoted by Trump attorney John Eastman came to be known as the Pence Card. The committee presented part of a video deposition of Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel who testified Trump had called her about helping to further the scheme Eastman also participated in the call. 184 185  Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger whose phone call with Trump was cited in the former presidents second impeachment testified that his office pursued hundreds of allegations of voter fraud but found no widespread fraud that would have changed the election result. In the end he found only 74 votes from people who had been ineligible to vote because of felony convictions and only 4 votes in the names of deceased people. There were no votes from underage or unregistered voters. 186 Biden had won the Georgia election by 11779 votes. Gabriel Sterling Raffenspergers deputy also testified. 14  During the Raffensperger testimony the committee played audio excerpts of the phone call he had with Trump on January 2 2021 and another call with Frances Watson the chief investigative officer for Raffenspergers office. Trump told Watson when the right answer comes out youll be praised. Trump is heard to tell Raffensperger he had won Georgia by at least 400000 votes though he actually lost by 11779 votes. He told Raffensperger I just want to find 11780 votes which is one more than we have because we won the state. Trump repeated a debunked allegation that a video showed a suitcase containing a minimum of 18000 ballots all for Biden brought to a ballot counting facility late at night for counting. Trump pleaded with Raffensperger to find the real truth and suggested Raffensperger could be criminally liable if he did not accede to the presidents wishes Why wouldnt you want to find the right answer Brad instead of keep saying that the numbers are right? So look can you get together tomorrow? And Brad we just want the truth. Its simple. And and everyones going to look very good if the truth comes out. Its Ok. It takes a little while but let the truth come out. And the truth the real truth is I won by 400000 votes at least. So so what are we going to do here? Because I only need 11000 votes. Fellas I need 11000 votes. Give me a break...I think youre going to find that they are shredding ballots because they have to get rid of the ballots because the ballots are unsigned the ballots are are corrupt and theyre brand new and they dont have seals and theres a whole thing with the ballots but the ballots are corrupt and youre going to find that they are which is totally illegal. Its its more illegal for you than it is for them. Because you know what they did and youre not reporting it. Thats a you know thats a criminal thats a criminal offense. And you know you cant let that happen. Thats thats a big risk to you and to Ryan your lawyer. And thats a big risk. 187  Arizona House Speaker Rusty Bowers testified. Bowers said that Trump had personally pressured him to overturn the states election results as had Rudy Giuliani Ginni Thomas 188 and John Eastman. Bowers said that Eastman told him Just do it and let the courts sort it out. Bowers characterized Trumps scheme as cheating since there was no evidence being presented of any strength of the claims. He said that participating in Trumps lie would have been foreign to my very being. He also testified that Arizona Congressman Andy Biggs called him on the morning of January 6 asking him to overturn the Arizona results. Shortly before the committee hearing Trump released a statement saying that Bowers had privately agreed with him in November 2020 that the Arizona election was rigged and stolen but Bowers specifically denied Trumps allegation during the hearing while under oath. 189 Bowers testified Giuliani told him Weve got lots of theories. We just dont have the evidence. 184  The committee revealed a text message sent by Senator Ron Johnsons chief of staff Sean Riley minutes before the vote certification began on January 6. In the message Riley informed Pences aide Chris Hodgson that the senator wanted to personally hand deliver information to the vice president about alternate slates of electors for MI and WI to which Hodgson replied do not give that to him. 190  Georgia election workers Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea Shaye Moss testified about their experiences. After the election Trump and Giuliani amplified a video that was taken out of context and used the footage to make baseless claims that Freeman and Moss had committed election fraud. The women and their family members were subjected to antiBlack racist smears and death threats and were warned by the FBI that they would not be safe in their home. During her testimony Freeman said There is nowhere I feel safe. Nowhere. Do you know how it feels to have the president of the United States target you? 191 192 Ms. Moss said that the false accusations made against her had impacted her wellbeing in a major way in every way all because of lies. 193  Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum acknowledged on June 21 after the fourth hearing The lack of election fraud evidence is the huge stunning clear moment here where these Republican people are saying Look I supported you please give me something to work with and it simply doesnt materialize. 194 Fox News host Brian Kilmeade similarly said on June 26 that Trumps allies couldnt prove any cheating had occurred. 195  By the fourth hearing committee members saw an increase in threats against them and were likely to be assigned security details. Kinzingers wife received a handwritten letter that threatened to execute her her husband and their fivemonthold baby. 196  A month later on July 20 the Arizona Republican Party censured Rusty Bowers for reasons including cosponsoring Democratled bills and refusing to work with Arizona Republicans. They did not directly mention his public testimony at the committees fourth hearing. 197 The state party had censured other leaders the previous year for criticizing Trump. 198  The fifth televised public hearing focused on Trumps pressure campaign to influence top Justice Department officials demanding they investigate election fraud conspiracy theories and rubber stamp his narrative that the election was stolen despite any factual evidence to support this claim. The hearing additionally detailed Trumps request to seize voting machines in late December 2020 plans to install Jeffrey Clark as acting attorney general were also revealed. Witnesses included Jeffrey Rosen former acting attorney general Richard Donoghue former acting deputy attorney general and Steven Engel former assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel. At Trumps request acting defense secretary Christopher Miller contacted an attach in Rome about the debunked QAnon theory which alleged an Italian defense contractor uploaded malware to a satellite in order to hack the election results and remotely switch votes from Trump to Biden. The conspiracy theory was relayed by Congressman Scott Perry to White House chief of staff Mark Meadows who then asked Rosen and Donoghue to investigate on behalf of the Department of Justice. 199 They flatly rejected the request as patently absurd. 200 The conspiracy theory was also pushed by former CIA employee Bradley Johnson 199 who was among those who gave video testimony. 201  Rosen and Donoghue continued to strongly resist Trumps efforts to have the Justice Department announce election fraud had been found just days after outgoing attorney general Bill Barr had resigned and announced that there was no significant evidence found which could have influenced the election. 202 Donoghue testified that during a phone call with then president Trump on December 27 he was told to Just say it was corrupt and leave the rest to me and the Republican congressmen. 203 204  On December 31 Trump rushed back to Washington D.C. from his Florida MaraLago estate in order to hold an emergency meeting at the White House in which Justice Department officials were called upon to attend. At one point Trump told them that voting machines had been hacked and the election stolen. Trump then asked why dont you guys seize these machines? Richard Donoghue explained that experts at DHS had already investigated and that there was nothing wrong with the voting machines ... and no factual basis to seize machines. 205 Trump then yelled Get Ken Cuccinelli on the phone and proceeded to insist that it was his job as the Homeland Security deputy secretary to seize voting machines. He told Cuccinelli youre not doing your job. 206 During the public hearing Jeffrey Rosen testified that the Department of Justice has no legal authority to seize voting machines and that he never informed Trump that the Department of Homeland Security could seize voting machines either. 207  Clark was shown to have provided a proof of concept letter that was composed by John Eastman and Justice Department lawyer Ken Klukowsi intending that the letter be delivered to Georgia officials. The letter falsely asserted that the Justice Department found election irregularities in that state and others in an effort to persuade the state legislature to rescind Bidens certified victory in Georgia. In response to this proposed letter a contentious meeting was held between Clark Attorney General Rosen and Deputy Attorney General Donoghue in which Donoghue told Clark What you are doing is nothing less than the United States Justice Department meddling in the outcome of a presidential election. 208 When Rosen refused to send the letter Clark then sought to take over the Department of Justice so that he could send the letter himself. 209  According to The New York Times it was Rep. Scott Perry who had first introduced Trump and Clark because of Clarks openness to conspiracy theories about election fraud and willingness to do the presidents bidding. 210 The committee presented text messages from December 26 2020 between Rep. Perry and Mark Meadows that revealed the congressmans role in the attempted scheme that unfolded days later to oust Rosen and install Clark as the top DOJ official. 211  White House call logs from the afternoon of January 3 showed that officials within the Oval Office were already referring to Clark as the Acting Attorney General although not having been officially appointed to the position. Later that day in a meeting at the White House with top Department of Justice officials Trump openly considered a move to replace Rosen with Clark saying What do I have to lose? to which Deputy Attorney General Donoghue replied Mr. President wed resign immediately. Im not working one minute for this guy who I just declared was completely incompetent ... Im telling you whats going to happen. Youre gonna lose your entire department leadership. Every single one of us will walk out. Your entire department of leadership will walk out within hours. 212  Ultimately the effort to appoint Clark send the letter to Georgia officials and attempt to decertify election results was averted when a majority of the DOJ Assistant Attorneys General threatened to resign en masse if the scheme went forward. 213 214 During Clarks video taped deposition with the committee he refused to answer most questions and pleaded the Fifth more than 100 times during his 100minuteslong interview with investigators. 215  Extracts of a January 11 email sent by Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks were shared. The congressman who had

Civil War has tapped into a dark set of national angst. In polls and in interviews a segment of voters say they fear the country s divides may lead to actual not just rhetorical battles. The South Dakota governor and potential vicepresidential pick for former President Donald J. Trump also dodged questions about abortion. In the Republican Party of 2024 styled in the image of former President Donald J. Trump a normpreserving consensusdriven act even a basic one can be a careerending offense. The former president had sought to have lawsuits against him put on hold until after his federal criminal trial on charges of plotting to overturn the 2020 election. Georgia Michigan and Nevada have already brought charges against people who posed as electors for Donald Trump and Arizona and Wisconsin have active investigations. The federal indictment of Donald Trump for plotting to overturn the 2020 election relies in part on the law that the Supreme Court weighed on Tuesday but was built to survive without it. La decisi n del tribunal podr a interrumpir los enjuiciamientos de cientos de involucrados en el ataque al Capitolio. Prosecutors have suggested that a total of 2000 or 2500 people could ultimately face indictment for their roles in the attack.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/23/5-key-takeaways-from-january-6-panels-report-on-us-capitol-riot, That is the conclusion of a nearly 850page final report released late on Thursday by a US congressional committee at the end of its 18month investigation into the deadly riot on January 6 2021. The report came just days after the panel recommended criminal charges against Trump for his role in the attack whi0ch saw a mob of the former president s supporters storm the Capitol to prevent Congress from certifying Joe Biden s election victory. It builds on months of public hearings during which US lawmakers made the case that Trump who has rejected the committee s work as partisan whipped the crowd into a frenzy and then failed to act to stop the riot. The report unambiguously blamed Trump for the attack on the Capitol The central cause of January 6th was one man former President Donald Trump whom many others followed. None of the events of January 6 would have happened without him it said. The panel went on to describe in detail what it dubbed Trump s multipart conspiracy to overturn the lawful results of the 2020 presidential election arguing that this plot culminated in the riot. Trump prematurely declared victory and started spreading voter fraud allegations he pressured state election officials the Department of Justice and his own Vice President Mike Pence to help reverse the results and then he summoned supporters to Washington DC incited them to attack the Capitol and failed to stop the riot for hours the report read.  President Trump s decision to declare victory falsely on election night and unlawfully to call for the vote counting to stop was not a spontaneous decision. It was premeditated it said. Members of the former president s 2020 reelection campaign embarked on a concerted lobbying effort late that year to convince Republican legislators in critical swing states won by Biden to appoint electors for Trump despite his loss the report also said.  According to a campaign staffer s spreadsheet produced to the Select Committee the Trump Campaign apparently tried contacting over 190 Republican State legislators in Arizona Georgia and Michigan alone it read. For example in a voicemail to a Michigan legislator that was leaked to the press a Trump campaign staffer urged a resolution in the state legislature to allow Michigan to send electors for Donald J Trump to the Electoral College and save our country .  While Campaign aides blanketed State officials with these calls some State officials received more personalized outreach directly from President Trump Trump s lawyer Rudy Giuliani and their allies throughout the postelection period about this issue the report said.  In his preriot speech at the Ellipse near the White House on January 6 2021 Trump told his supporters that he would walk down to the Capitol with them. After this we re going to walk down and I ll be there with you We re going walk down to the Capitol he said urging the crowd to show strength . The committee said in its report that Trump was serious about those plans as the US Secret Service tasked with protecting the president was ready to secure the trip until violence escalated on Capitol Hill. The president just said that he is going up to the US Capitol to watch the vote one Secret Service official wrote in an email during the speech. As the protesters some of whom would soon turn into rioters walked towards Congress Trump was pressing his request to go to the Capitol the report said. Robert Engel the head of Trump s Secret Service detail is cited as saying that the thenpresident asked to go to the Capitol immediately after his speech but his request was denied and he returned to the White House. President Trump nevertheless persisted in his request to go to the Capitol the report read. Engel later wrote in an email that the Secret Service was discussing options and setting expectations around Trump s request but the force s leadership eventually determined that it would not be advisable for Trump to go anywhere near the Capitol. The report detailed how multiple security agencies including DC Metropolitan Police US Secret Service Capitol Police USCP FBI Department of Homeland Security DHS and the Department of Defense were aware of the potential for violence on January 6. The agencies received intelligence about online posts on various social media platforms and proTrump websites calling for an attack on the Capitol days before the riot the committee s report said. For instance a January 2 2021 post by a Trump supporter read This is not a rally and it s no longer a protest. This is a final stand many are ready to die to take back USA And don t be surprised if we take the capital building sic.  A Capitol Police intelligence official also told the force s leadership that January 6 would be the final chance for Trump s supporters to overturn the 2020 election which increases the potential for violence noting that the target is Congress . Yet despite the intelligence and publicly available threats against the US legislature the report showed that law enforcement officials across various agencies still underestimated the potential for violence arguing that Capitol Police would be able to contain the situation. For example top Capitol Police officials discussed calling in the National Guard before January 6 but later agreed that a request for the DC National Guard would not be necessary particularly if the USCP was in an all hands on deck posture the report said. Lawmakers concluded in their report that there are additional steps that should have been taken to address the potential for violence on that day . The report included a list of recommendations by committee members to prevent events similar to January 6 from happening again including prosecuting individuals responsible for the attack and reprimanding lawyers who pushed false election fraud claims. Committee members also said those responsible for the events of January 6 should be disqualified from holding public office in accordance with the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution which addresses insurrection a reference to Trump who is running for president in 2024. The report urged wholeofgovernment strategies to combat the threat of violent activity posed by all extremist groups including white nationalist groups and violent antigovernment groups while adding that law enforcement agencies need to improve their response to such threats. The House of Representatives s subpoena authorities should also be strengthened after several Trump allies and the former president himself defied the committee s requests for information and testimony it said. Thanks to the dedicated folks at USGPO the final report is on its way.  Read it now httpst.coIaOMOevYfr pic.twitter.comfmho4WvyQJ  January 6th Committee January6thCmte December 23 2022 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack, The following article is a broad timeline of the course of events surrounding the attack on the United States Capitol on January 6 2021 by rioters supporting United States President Donald Trumps attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. ProTrump rioters stormed the United States Capitol after assembling on the Ellipse of the Capitol complex for a rally headlined as the Save America March. 1 2 3  At the rally Donald Trump Jr. Rudy Giuliani and several Republican members of Congress addressed the crowd and repeated Donald Trumps false claims that electoral fraud affected the 2020 election outcome. In his hourlong speech President Trump suggested marching towards the Capitol assuring his audience he would be with them to demand that Congress only count the electors who have been lawfully slated and peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard. Towards his conclusion he said we fight. We fight like hell. And if you dont fight like hell youre not going to have a country anymore. 4 5 6  The demonstrations turned violent with attendees breaching multiple police perimeters assaulting Capitol police officers and occupying vandalizing 7 8 and ransacking 9 parts of the building for several hours. 9 10 Four people died that day rioter Ashli Babbitt was fatally shot by a Capitol Police officer two died of heart conditions another died of an amphetamine intoxication. The next day Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick died after suffering two strokes having been physically attacked and pepper sprayed during the riot. 11 12 13 14  All times are specified or approximated in Eastern Time or UTC500. We stand ready and are standing by to answer the call from our President should the need arise that We The People are needed to take back our country from the pure evil that is conspiring to steal our country away from the American people. We are ready to enter into battle with General Flynn leading the charge. We will not act unless we are told to. And we will not act on our own as TTPO but rather as a united body of American patriots.  On January 6 2021 Vice President Mike Pence as President of the Senate should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence. No legislative act wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78 contrary to the Constitution can be valid. The court in Hubbard v. Lowe reinforced this truth That an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a proposition no longer open to discussion. 226 F. 135 137 SDNY 1915 appeal dismissed 242 U.S. 654 1916. Following this rationale an unconstitutionally appointed elector like an unconstitutionally enacted statute is no elector at all. 149  At noon Trump began an over onehour speech encouraging protesters to march to the U.S. Capitol. At 1249 p.m. Capitol Police responded to reports of an explosive device later identified as a pipe bomb. At 1253 p.m. nineteen minutes before Trump ended his speech rioters overran the perimeter of the Capitol building and at 206 p.m. they entered the building through the Columbus Doors. Trumps tweet requesting the crowd to stay peaceful is sent roughly half an hour later at 238 p.m. However at 244 p.m. a Capitol Police officer inside the Speakers Lobby adjacent to the House chambers shot and fatally wounded rioter Ashli Babbitt as she climbed through a broken window of a barricaded door. Minutes later Governor of Virginia Ralph Northam activated all available assets of the State of Virginia including the Virginia National Guard to aid the U.S. Capitol although the Department of Defense still had not authorized it. By 315 p.m. assets from Virginia began rolling into D.C. An hour later at 417 p.m a video of Trump was uploaded to Twitter in which he instructed you have to go home now. Fifteen minutes later Secretary Miller authorized the D.C. National Guard to actually deploy. States want to correct their votes which they now know were based on irregularities and fraud plus corrupt process never received legislative approval. All Mike Pence has to do is send them back to the States AND WE WIN. Do it Mike this is a time for extreme courage! 165 166  It is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not. If you dont fight like hell youre not going to have a country anymore....Were going to try and give them Republicans the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country...The Democrats are hopeless they never vote for anything. Not even one vote. But were going to try and give our Republicans the weak ones because the strong ones dont need any of our help. Were going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. According to the final report of the January 6 House select committee Here s what President Trump did during the 187 minutes between the end of his speech and when he finally told rioters to go home For hours he watched the attack from his TV screen. His channel of choice was Fox News. He issued a few tweets some on his own inclination and some only at the repeated behest of his daughter and other trusted advisors. He made several phone calls some to his personal lawyer Rudolph Giuliani some to Members of Congress about continuing their objections to the electoral certification even though the attack was well underway.Here s what President Trump did not do He did not call any relevant law enforcement agency to ensure they were working to quell the violence. He did not call the Secretary of Defense he did not call the Attorney General he did not call the Secretary of Homeland Security. And for hours on end he refused the repeated requests from nearly everyone who talked to him to simply tell the mob to go home. 222  Trumps aides confirmed that he watched the television coverage 223 but Trump himself has refused to admit doing so. 224 Two months after the attack on the Capitol he told journalist Jonathan Karl When I get back to the White House I saw I wanted to go back to the Capitol. I was thinking about going back during the problem to stop the problem doing it myself. Secret Service didnt like that idea too much. 213  Please support our Capitol Police and Law Enforcement. They are truly on the side of our Country. Stay peaceful! 165   268   I know your pain I know youre hurt. We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election and everyone knows it especially the other side. But you have to go home now. We have to have peace. We have to have law and order. We have to respect our great people in law and order. We dont want anybody hurt. Its a very tough period of time. Theres never been a time like this where such a thing happened where they could take it away from all of us from me from you from our country. This was a fraudulent election but we cant play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home. We love you. Youre very special. Youve seen what happens. You see the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel but go home and go home in peace. At some point during the afternoon Trump tried to call into Lou Dobbs Tonight which aired every weekday at 5 p.m. but Fox executives decided it would be irresponsible to allow him on the air. 40  These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love in peace. Remember this day forever! 165 
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/01/04/a-look-back-at-americans-reactions-to-the-jan-6-riot-at-the-u-s-capitol/, A year later here s a look back at how Americans saw the events of Jan. 6 and how some partisan divisions grew wider over time. All findings in this analysis are based on Pew Research Center surveys conducted in January March and September of last year. This Pew Research Center analysis examines Americans initial reactions to the riot at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6 2021 and how their views changed in the months that followed it. All findings in this analysis come from Center surveys conducted in January March and September of last year. Everyone who participated in all three surveys is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The surveys were weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. For additional details about the methodology of each survey including the field dates sample size and questions asked open the links for each report. Americans expressed shock horror and anguish over the riot at the Capitol but partisan divides were clear even in the first days after Jan. 6. In a survey conducted from Jan. 8 to 12 2021 around seveninten U.S. adults 69 said they had heard a lot about the riot and another 28 said they had heard a little. In volunteered openended responses to the survey from more than 2600 adults many Americans expressed strong negative emotions such as shock and anger as well as surprise and concern for the country.  A slap in the face to democracy something you would expect to see in a third world nation said one man in his 60s. Shocked horrified and sad for our country said a woman in her 60s. We were there a few years ago and were awestruck. How could fellow citizens violently enter federal buildings intending to destroy property and possibly harm our leaders?  While negative reactions surfaced in both parties Democrats and Democraticleaning independents were much more likely than Republicans and GOP leaners to volunteer an emotion such as disappointment disbelief or fear 48 vs. 27. Republicans were more likely than Democrats to express doubts about who was behind the riot Nearly oneinfive Republicans who volunteered a reaction 17 said the destruction hadn t actually been instigated by Trump supporters instead saying it had been done by groups such as Antifa or Black Lives Matter. Republicans were divided in the wake of Jan. 6 over whether thenPresident Donald Trump bore responsibility for the actions of some of his supporters that day. Overall 52 of U.S. adults said Trump bore a lot of responsibility for the violence and destruction at the Capitol while 23 said he bore some responsibility and a similar share 24 said he bore none at all. Around half of Republicans and GOP leaners said Trump either bore a lot 18 or some responsibility 34 for the riot. But nearly as many 46 said he bore no responsibility at all. An overwhelming majority of Democrats and Democratic leaners 95 placed at least some blame for the riot on Trump including around eightinten 81 who said he bore a lot of responsibility for it. Americans were also deeply divided by party over whether it would be better for the country for Trump to be removed from office in the days after the riot. Around eightinten Democrats 83 said it would be better for Trump to be removed and replaced by thenVice President Mike Pence for the final days of his term. Nearly as many Republicans 79 said it would be better for the country for Trump to finish out his term himself. Overall more than half of Americans 54 said it would be better for the country for Trump to be removed and replaced by Pence while 45 favored Trump remaining in office until the end of his term. Between March and September 2021 Americans became less likely to say it was important to find and prosecute the Capitol rioters with all of the decline occurring among Republicans. In a survey conducted in early March 87 of U.S. adults said it was very or somewhat important for federal law enforcement agents to find and prosecute those who broke into the Capitol on Jan. 6. By September that figure had slipped to 78. Around eightinten Republicans 79 said in the March survey that it was very or somewhat important to find and prosecute the Capitol rioters. By September 57 expressed that view. Among Democrats 95 said in both surveys that it was very or somewhat important to find and prosecute the rioters. In both parties there was a decline in the share of adults who said it was very important to identify and prosecute the rioters. But the decrease was much more pronounced among Republicans from 50 in March to 27 in September than among Democrats from 86 to 80. While some GOP elected officials publicly rebuked Trump in the wake of Jan. 6 Republicans in the U.S. became less open to intraparty criticism of the former president in the months after the riot. In midJanuary 2021 10 Republican representatives joined all Democrats in a House vote to impeach Trump for his role in the violence at the Capitol. In February seven Senate Republicans joined Democrats in a vote to convict him though the effort still failed to reach the necessary twothirds majority for approval. Nationally the share of Republicans who said their party should be very or somewhat accepting of GOP elected officials who openly criticize Trump declined from 43 in March to 36 in September according to the Center s surveys. The share of Republicans who said their party should be not too or not at all accepting of such officials rose from 56 to 63. Democrats too became less likely to say their party should be accepting of Democratic elected officials who openly criticize President Joe Biden. Around twothirds 68 said in March that their party should be very or somewhat accepting of such officials a figure that declined to 57 by September. Still majorities of Democrats said in both surveys that their party should be accepting of officials who openly criticize the current president. As of September 2021 there were wide partisan differences over the severity of the criminal penalties imposed on the Jan. 6 rioters and whether the House s investigation of the riot would be fair or not. In the months after the riot which led to multiple deaths as well as injuries to around 150 law enforcement officers the U.S. Justice Department arrested and began to prosecute hundreds of people who participated. A select committee of the U.S. House of Representatives launched its own investigation. In the Center s September survey around half of U.S. adults 48 said the criminal penalties that had been imposed on the rioters by that point had not been severe enough while 29 said the penalties had been about right and 20 said they had been too severe. Around seveninten Democrats 71 said the criminal penalties by that point had not been severe enough while 21 said they had been about right and only 6 said they had been too severe. Among Republicans similar shares said the penalties had been too severe 38 and about right 39 while 19 said they had not been severe enough. In the same survey a narrow majority of Americans 54 said they were either not too or not at all confident that the House committee s investigation into the Jan. 6 riot would be fair and reasonable. Here too partisan differences were wide. Around eightinten Republicans said they were either not too 37 or not at all confident 40 that the committee s investigation would be fair and reasonable while 63 of Democrats said they were at least somewhat confident that it would be.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_commission, The National Commission to Investigate the January 6 Attack on the United States Capitol Complex known colloquially as the January 6 commission was an unsuccessful proposal to create a commission that would have investigated the January 6 United States Capitol attack. On February 15 2021 Speaker of the United States House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi announced that she planned to create a 911type commission. 1 2 The details were initially negotiated by Republican John Katko and would have consisted of an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. 3 A bill forming the commission passed the House of Representatives on May 19 4 with all Democrats and 35 Republicans voting in support of it. However it was blocked by Senate Republicans on May 28 with 54 Senators voting in favor and 35 voting against failing to clear the 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. 5  After the bill establishing the commission failed the House of Representatives created the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack. On January 6 2021 an armed 6 mob of supporters of Donald Trump stormed the United States Capitol in Washington D.C. in an attempt to keep Trump in power even though he lost the 2020 presidential election to Joe Biden. At the time of the attack the US Congress was counting the votes of the electoral college the last step to formalize Bidens victory as the 46th president of the United States. Five people died either shortly before during or following the event one was shot by Capitol Police another died of a drug overdose and three died of natural causes. 7 8 Many people were injured including 138 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. 9 As of July 7 2022 update monetary damages to the government and police forces caused by the attackers exceeded 2700000. 10  A few days after the January 6 attack on the Capitol the US House of Representatives filed one article of impeachment against Donald Trump incitement of insurrection. At the Senate impeachment trial on February 13 Trump was acquitted the required twothirds majority not being met. Senator Lindsey Graham said that they need a 911 commission to find out what happened and make sure it never happens again and he wants to make sure that the Capitol footprint can be better defended next time. Senator Chris Coons agreed with this statement. 11  On February 15 2021 Nancy Pelosi announced in a letter to Democrats in the House of Representatives she planned to create a 911type commission to investigate the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. 1 2 It would have contained no members of Congress and been an outside commission 1 In the letter she said that  ... their next step will be to establish an outside independent 911type commission to investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex ... and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power including facts and causes relating to the preparedness and response of the United States Capitol Police and other Federal State and local law enforcement in the National Capitol Region. 1 12  The priorities would have been to investigate and report on the facts and causes relating to the January 6 2021 domestic terrorist attack upon the United States Capitol Complex and relating to the interference with the peaceful transfer of power including facts and causes relating to the preparedness and response of the United States Capitol Police and other Federal State and local law enforcement in the National Capitol Region. 13  Under the provisions of the bill the commission would have been composed of ten members outside of the federal government appointed by congressional leaders. The four party leaders in Congress Nancy Pelosi Kevin McCarthy Chuck Schumer Mitch McConnell would have each appointed two members with Democratic leaders jointly appointing the chair and the Republican leaders jointly appointing the vicechair. This would have allowed Democrats and Republicans to appoint equal number of members. 14  The commissioners would have been tasked with filing a report by the end of 2021 and ending 60 days after that. 14  The chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee Bennie Thompson and its Republican ranking member John Katko announced on May 14 that they had reached an agreement on the creation of the panel. Under the deal the Commission would have been modeled after the 911 Commission ten members half chosen by Democrats including the chair and half chosen by Republicans including the vice chair. Subpoenas could be issued upon approval of both the chair and vicechair and the Commission would have produced a final report by the end of the year. 15 Despite the deal the leader of the House Republicans Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy opposed the bipartisan commission 16 17 coming out against its formation after the rightwing House Freedom Caucus and Trump opposed it. 18  The House voted on a bill forming the commission and it passed the House of Representatives on May 19. 4 Every Democrat and 35 Republicans supported it other Republicans opposed. 18  This legislation was ultimately blocked by Senate Republicans on May 28 with a vote of 54 35 19 short of the 60 needed to clear the filibuster. Eleven senators were absent for the vote composed of two Democrats and nine Republicans. 20 All present Democrats voted for the commission along with Republicans Lisa Murkowski RAK Rob Portman ROH Mitt Romney RUT Bill Cassidy RLA Susan Collins RME and Ben Sasse RNE. All votes against were made by the other Republicans. 21  Senator Chuck Schumer promised that the House bill would receive a vote in the Senate criticizing the minority leaders for bucking bipartisan negotiations. 22  Just a week after the Capitol attack House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy had advocated for congressional action to form a commission stating that a factfinding commission ... would be prudent. In subsequent negotiations the democrats proposal included three of the conditions McCarthy had requested. 23 Members of the Problem Solvers Caucus expressed support for the commission. 24 Republicans who voted to impeach Trump also expressed their support such as Liz Cheney Anthony Gonzalez and Adam Kinzinger. 25  On May 19 2021 House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy retracted his earlier support accusing Pelosi of negotiating in bad faith and stated that the scope of the legislation needed to examine other instances of political violence. McCarthy thus opposed the agreement that the House Homeland Security chairman Bennie Thompson made with the vice chairman John Katko and which the House approved on the same day as McCarthy announced opposition. 26  Other Republicans also gave various reasons for opposing the commission including  On May 12 during a House Oversight Committee hearing Arizona Representative Paul Gosar and Georgia Representative Jody Hice had asserted those who attacked the Capitol were peaceful patriots. Gosar said one individual killed during the event Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt was executed. Hice said it was Trump supporters who lost their lives that day not Trump supporters who were taking the lives of others. 29 30 At the same hearing Georgia representative Andrew Clyde downplayed the events saying there was an undisciplined mob but to call it an insurrection in my opinion is a boldfaced lie. Because footage showed people in an orderly fashion in between the stanchions and ropes taking pictures Clyde said If you didnt know the footage was from January 6 you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit. 31  Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson met with Gladys Sicknick and Sandra Garza mother and longtime girlfriend respectively of deceased Capitol officer Brian Sicknick prior to his vote. Johnson had previously voiced opposition to the bill and said he respectfully disagreed with the two following the meeting. 32  On June 8 the Senate released the results of its investigation of the riot. 33 34 On June 24 Pelosi announced that the House would investigate these matters and the United States House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack was formed on July 1.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6_February_1934_crisis,  FarRight Leagues  Government of France  Leftwing protesters  Charles Maurras Pierre Taittinger Marcel Bucard Fran ois de La Rocque Fran ois Coty  Albert Lebrun douard Daladier  Maurice Thorez  The 6 February 1934 crisis also known as the Veterans Riot 1 was an antiparliamentarist street demonstration in Paris organized by multiple farrightist leagues that culminated in a riot on the Place de la Concorde near the building used for the French National Assembly. The police shot and killed 17 people nine of whom were farright protesters. It was one of the major political crises during the Third Republic 1870 1940. 2 Leftist Frenchmen claimed it was an attempt to organize a fascist coup d tat. According to historian Joel Colton The consensus among scholars is that there was no concerted or unified design to seize power and that the leagues lacked the coherence unity or leadership to accomplish such an end. 3  As a result of the actions of that day several antifascist organisations were created such as the Comit de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes in an attempt to thwart fascism in France. After World War II several historians among them Serge Berstein argued that while some leagues had indisputably desired a coup Fran ois de La Rocque had in fact moderated toward a respect for constitutional order. However the fascist actions on 6 February were arguably an uncoordinated but violent attempt to overthrow the Cartel des gauches government elected in 1932. 4  RadicalSocialist politician douard Daladier who was president of the Council of Ministers replaced Camille Chautemps on 27 January 1934 because of accusations of corruption including the Stavisky Affair. Daladier who had been popular was nonetheless forced to resign on 7 February. He was replaced by the conservative Radical Gaston Doumergue as head of the government this was the first time during the Third Republic that a government was ended because of street demonstrations. France was affected in 1931 somewhat later than other Western countries by the 1929 Great Depression initiated by the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Black Tuesday. The economic and social crisis particularly affected the middle classes who tended traditionally to endorse the Republic in particular the RadicalSocialist Party. Parliamentary instability ensued with five governments between May 1932 and January 1934 which encouraged antiparliamentarists. 5  Dissidents took advantage of a succession of political and financial scandals to gain power including the Marthe Hanau Affair the Oustric Affair which involved the Minister of Justice and provoked the end of Andr Tardieus government in 1930 and finally the Stavisky Affair. The Stavisky Affair reached the news in 1933. It involved Bayonnes Cr dit municipal bank and centered around embezzler Alexandre Stavisky known as le beau Sasha Handsome Sasha associated with several Radical deputies including a minister of Camille Chautempss government. Tensions rose when the press later revealed that Stavisky had benefited from a 19month postponement of his trial because the public prosecutor was Chautemps brotherinlaw. On 8 January 1934 Alexandre Stavisky was found dead and the police reported suicide as the cause a convenient statement that raised public concerns of a coverup. According to rightists Chautemps had had him assassinated to keep him from revealing any secrets. The press then started a political campaign against alleged governmental corruption while far rightists demonstrated. At the end of the month after the revelation of yet another scandal Chautemps resigned.   douard Daladier another politician of the RadicalSocialist Party succeeded him on 27 January 1934. Thirteen demonstrations had already occurred since 9 January in Paris. While the parliamentary right was trying to use the affair to replace the leftwing majority elected during the 1932 elections the far right took advantage of its traditional themes antisemitism xenophobia Stavisky was a naturalized Ukrainian Jew hostility toward Freemasonry Camille Chautemps was a Masonic dignitary and antiparliamentarism. As historian Serge Bernstein emphasized the Stavisky Affair was exceptional neither in its seriousness nor in the personalities put on trial but in the rightists determination to use the opportunity to make a leftist government resign helped by the fact that the RadicalSocialists did not have an absolute majority in the National Assembly and thus the government was weak and an alternative coalition might be formed by the parties to the right. However it was the dismissal of the police prefect Jean Chiappe that ultimately provoked the massive demonstrations of 6 February. Chiappe a fervent anticommunist was accused of double standards including leniency towards the street agitation of the farright demonstrations riots attacks against the few leftist students in the Quartier Latin by the monarchist Camelots du Roi the youth organization of the Action Fran aise etc.. According to leftists Chiappes dismissal was due to his involvement with the Stavisky Affair while the rightists denounced the negotiations with the RadicalSocialists the departure of Chiappe was said to have been in exchange for an endorsement of Daladiers new government. Rightist antiparliamentary leagues had been the main activists during the January 1934 demonstrations. Although these leagues were not a new phenomenon the old Ligue des Patriotes Patriot League had been initiated by Paul D roul de in 1882 they played an important role after World War I in particular when leftists were in power as they had been since the 1932 legislative elections. 6 The leagues differed in their goals but were united by their opposition to the ruling RadicalSocialist party. On the night of 6 February the leagues which had gathered in different places in Paris all converged on Place de la Concorde located in front of the Bourbon Palace but on the other side of the river Seine. The police and guards managed to defend the strategic bridge of the Concorde despite being the target of all sorts of projectiles. Some rioters were armed and the police fired on the crowd. Disturbances lasted until 230 AM. Seventeen people were killed and 2000 injured most of them members of the Action Fran aise. Farrightist organisations had the most important role in the riots most of the UNC veterans avoided the Place de la Concorde creating some incidents near the Elys e Palace the presidents residence. However Communists belonging to the rival leftist veterans organization ARAC may have been involved one public notice afterward condemned the governing centreleft coalition known as the Cartel des gauches for having shot unarmed veterans who shouted Down with the thieves long live France!. citation needed  While on the right side of the Seine north on the Place de la Concorde the policemens charges contained the rioters with difficulty the Croixdefeu had chosen to demonstrate in the south. The Palais Bourbon the building used by the National Assembly is much more difficult to defend on this side but the Croixdefeu limited themselves to surrounding the building without any major incident before dispersing. Because of this attitude they earned the pejorative nickname of Froides Queues in the farrightist press. Contrary to the other leagues which were intent on abolishing the Republic it thus seemed that Colonel de la Rocque finally decided to respect the legality of the republican unlike the Action Fran aise and parliamentary unlike the Jeunesses Patriotes regime. In the National Assembly the rightists attempted to take advantage of the riots to cause the Cartel des gauches government to resign. The leftists however rallied around president of the Council douard Daladier. The session was ended after left and rightwing deputies exchanged blows. During the night Daladier took the first measures to obtain the reestablishment of public order. He did not exclude the possibility of declaring a state of emergency although he finally decided against it. However the next day the judiciary and the police resisted his directives. Moreover most of his ministers and his party denied him their endorsement. Thus Daladier finally chose to resign. This was the first time during the Third Republic that a government had to resign because of pressure from street demonstrations. The crisis was finally resolved with the formation of a new government directed by former president of the Republic 1924 31 Gaston Doumergue a rightist Radical Republican who was ostensibly the only figure acceptable to both the farrightist leagues and to the centrist parliamentary parties. Termed a National Union government in reality it was a government containing all political traditions but excluding the Socialist and Communist parties. It included the most important politicians of the parliamentary right wing among them the Liberal Andr Tardieu Radical Louis Barthou and socialCatholic Louis Marin although also included were several members of the centreleft the RadicalSocialist and similar smaller parties plus War Minister Philippe P tain who would later command the collaborationist Vichy regime during World War II. After 6 February leftists were convinced that a fascist putsch had occurred. The importance of the antiparliamentarist activity of farrightist leagues was undeniable. Some of them such as the Francisque had copied all of their characteristics from the Italian Fascio leagues which had marched on Rome in 1922 thus resulting in the imposition of the fascist regime. Although historian Serge Bernstein has showed that Colonel de la Rocque had probably been convinced of the necessity of respecting constitutional legality this was not true of all members of his Croixdefeu society which also shared at least superficially some characteristics of the fascist leagues in particular their militarism and fascination for parades. On 9 February 1934 a socialist and communist counterdemonstration occurred while Daladier was being replaced by Doumergue. Nine people were killed during incidents with the police forces. On 12 February the trade union Conf d ration g n rale du travail CGT reformist with some associations with the Socialist Party and the Conf d ration g n rale du travail unitaire CGTU revolutionary and associated with the communist party decided to organize a oneday general strike while the socialist party Section fran aise de lInternationale ouvri re SFIO and the communist party opted for a separate demonstration. However at the initiative of the popular base of these societies the demonstrations finally united themselves into one. Thus this day marked a first tentative union between the socialists and the communists. It had at its core the antifascism shared by both Marxist parties a union had been opposed since the division of the 1920 Tours Congress but this new rapprochement resulted in the 1936 Popular Front consisting of radicals and socialists and endorsed without participation in the government by the Communist party. This antifascist union was in acordance with Stalins directives to the Comintern which had asked the European communist parties to ally with other leftist parties including socialdemocrats and socialists in order to block the contagion of fascist and anticommunist regimes in Europe. 9  Furthermore several antifascist organizations were created after the riots such as the Comit de vigilance des intellectuels antifascistes Watchfulness Committee of Antifascist Intellectuals created in March 1934 which included philosopher Alain ethnologist Paul Rivet and physicist Paul Langevin. The anarchists also participated with many antifascist actions. After the crisis the parliamentary rightists also began to get closer to the counterrevolutionary far rightists. Several of its main activists would lose all trust in parliamentary institutions. Daniel Hal vy a French historian of Jewish ancestry publicly declared that since 6 February 1934 he was now a man of the extreme right. Although he personally abhorred Italian fascism or German national socialism he later endorsed the P tain regime of Vichy. 10 The radicalization of the rightists would accelerate after the election of the Popular Front in 1936 and the Spanish Civil War 1936 39. The American journalist John Gunther wrote in 1940 that the Croixdefeu could easily have captured the Chamber of Deputies. But de la Rocque held his men back. France wasnt ready he explained. It was possible Gunther said that like Hitler he hopes to gain power by legal means. 11 To the far rightists 6 February represented a failed opportunity to abolish the Republic which only presented itself again in 1940 after the balance had been changed by the trange d faite Marc Bloch or divine surprise Charles Maurras that is the 1940 defeat during the Battle of France against Germany. This deception prompted several farright members to radicalize themselves endorsing fascism Nazism or the wartime Vichy regime. Despite the claims of the leftists the 6 February crisis was not a fascist conspiracy. The farrightist leagues were not united enough and most of them lacked any specific objectives. However their violent methods their paramilitary appearances their cult of leadership etc. explained why they have often been associated with fascism. Other than these appearances however and their will to see the parliamentary regime replaced by an authoritarian regime historians Ren R mond and Serge Bernstein do not consider that they had a real fascist project. Opposing this opinion other historians such as Michel Dobry or Zeev Sternhell considered them as being fully fascist leagues. Brian Jenkins claimed it was pointless to seek a fascist essence in France and preferred to make comparisons which resulted according to him in a convergence between Italian fascism and the majority of the French leagues in particular the Action Fran aise in other words Jenkins considers fascism an Italian historic phenomenon and though a fascistlike philosophy existed in France it should not be termed fascist as that name should be reserved for Benito Mussolinis politics. 12 13 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_6_United_States_Capitol_attack, ProTrump farright militias and movements United States federal government and D.C. and state governments On January 6 2021 the United States Capitol Building in Washington D.C. was attacked by a mob 33 34 35 of supporters of thenU.S. president Donald Trump two months after his defeat in the 2020 presidential election. They sought to keep Trump in power by occupying the Capitol and preventing a joint session of Congress counting the Electoral College votes to formalize the victory of Presidentelect Joe Biden. The attack was ultimately unsuccessful in preventing the certification of the election results. According to the bipartisan House select committee that investigated the incident the attack was the culmination of a sevenpart plan by Trump to overturn the election. 36 37  Within 36 hours five people died one was shot by Capitol Police another died of a drug overdose and three died of natural causes including a police officer. c 28 38 Many people were injured including 174 police officers. Four officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months. 29 Damages caused by attackers exceeded 2.7 million. 39  Encouraged by Trump 40 41 on January 5 and 6 thousands of his supporters gathered in Washington D.C. to support his false claims that the 2020 election had been stolen by emboldened radicalleft Democrats 42 43 44 45 and to demand that thenVice President Mike Pence and Congress reject Bidens victory. 46 Starting at noon on January 6 47 at a Save America rally on the Ellipse Trump gave a speech in which he repeated false claims of election irregularities 48 and said If you dont fight like hell youre not going to have a country anymore. 49 50 As Congress began the electoral vote count thousands of attendees some armed walked to the Capitol with hundreds breaching police perimeters. 51 52 Among the rioters were leaders of the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers militia groups who conspired to use violence and interfere with the peaceful transfer of power. 53  More than 2000 rioters entered the building 54 55 56 with many vandalizing and looting 57 58 including the offices of thenHouse speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Congress members. 59 Rioters also assaulted Capitol Police officers and reporters and attempted to capture and harm lawmakers. 60 A gallows was erected west of the Capitol with rioters chanting to Hang Mike Pence after he rejected requests from Trump and others to use his authority to overturn the election results. 61  With building security breached Capitol Police evacuated and locked down both chambers of Congress and several buildings in the Complex. 62 Rioters occupied the empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor. 63 64 Pipe bombs were found at both the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee headquarters and Molotov cocktails were discovered in a vehicle near the Capitol. 65 66  Trump resisted sending the National Guard to quell the mob. 67 Later that afternoon in a Twitter video he reasserted the inaccurate claim that the election was fraudulent and told his supporters to go home in peace. 68 69 The Capitol was cleared of rioters by midevening 70 and the electoral vote count was resumed and completed by the early morning of January 7. Pence declared Presidentelect Biden and Vice Presidentelect Kamala Harris victorious. Pressured by his cabinet the threat of removal and many resignations Trump later conceded to an orderly transition of power in a televised statement. 71 72  A week after the attack the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection making him the only U.S. president to be impeached twice. 73 In February after Trump had left office the Senate voted 57 43 in favor of conviction but fell short of the required twothirds resulting in his acquittal. 74 Senate Republicans blocked a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack 75 60 so the House instead approved a select investigation committee consisting of seven Democrats and two Republicans. d 76 77 They held nine televised public hearings on the attack 78 voted to subpoena Trump 79 and recommended that the Department of Justice DOJ prosecute Trump. On August 1 2023 following a special counsel investigation Trump was indicted on four charges. 80 81  More than 1200 people have been charged with federal crimes relating to the attack. As of December 2023 update 728 defendants had pleaded guilty while another 166 defendants were convicted at trial a total of 745 defendants have been sentenced. 82 32 e Many participants in the attack were linked to farright extremist groups or conspiratorial movements including the Oath Keepers Proud Boys and Three Percenters. 83 84 Numerous plotters were convicted of seditious conspiracy including Oath Keepers and Proud Boys members 82 the longest sentence to date was given to thenProud Boy chairman Enrique Tarrio who was sentenced to 22 years in prison. 85  Joe Biden of the Democratic Party defeated incumbent Republican Party president Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. 86 Trump and other Republicans attempted to overturn the election falsely claiming widespread voter fraud. 87  Within hours after the closing of the polls while votes were still being tabulated Trump declared victory demanding that further counting be halted. 88 He began a campaign to subvert the election through legal challenges and an extralegal effort. Ten days after the election Trumps attorneys came to the conclusion that there was neither a factual foundation nor a valid legal argument for challenging the election results. 45 Despite those analyses Trump sought to overturn the results by filing at least sixty lawsuits including two that came before the Supreme Court. Those actions sought to nullify election certifications and to void votes that had been cast for Biden. Those challenges were all rejected by the courts for lack of evidence or the absence of legal standing. 87 Trumps legal team led by Sidney Powell filed those lawsuits while knowing they had no factual basis or legal merit. 45 In August 2021 Powell and other Trump attorneys were formally sanctioned for participating in a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process... by filing baseless and frivolous lawsuits in order to undermine public confidence in the democratic process. 89  Trump then mounted a campaign to pressure Republican governors secretaries of state and state legislatures to nullify results by replacing slates of Biden electors with slates pledged to Trump or by manufacturing evidence of fraud Trumps role in the plot to use fake electors led to his being prosecuted in Michigan Georgia and in federal court. He further demanded that lawmakers investigate ostensible election irregularities such as by conducting signature matches of mailedin ballots disregarding any prior analytic efforts. Trump also personally made inquiries regarding the possibility of invoking martial law to rerun or reverse the election 87 90 and appointing a special counsel to find instances of fraud despite conclusions by federal and state officials that such cases were few and isolated or nonexistent. Trump ultimately undertook neither step. 87 Trump repeatedly urged Vice President Mike Pence to alter the results and to stop Biden from taking office. None of those actions would have been within Pences constitutional powers as vice president and president of the Senate. Trump repeated this call in his rally speech on the morning of January 6. 91  Numerous scholars historians political scientists and journalists have characterized these efforts to overturn the election as an attempted selfcoup by Trump and an implementation of the big lie. 92 On July 16 2023 Donald Trump was notified that he was officially a target in the Smith special counsel investigation. 93 Trump attorney Sidney Powell would later plead guilty to conspiring to interfere with the election. 94  On December 18 four days after the Electoral College voted Trump called for supporters to attend a rally before the January 6 Congressional vote count writing on Twitter Big protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there will be wild!. 12 95 On December 28 farright activist Ali Alexander described collaboration with the Proud Boys and explained that the purpose of the January 6 event would be to build momentum and pressure and then on the day change hearts and minds of Congresspeoples sic who werent yet decided or saw everyone outside and said I cant be on the other side of that mob. 96 Alexander named three Republican members of the House as allies who were planning something big Paul Gosar Andy Biggs and Mo Brooks. 97 Were the four guys who came up with a January 6 event he said. 98  On December 23 2020 Roger Stones group Stop the Steal posted plans to occupy just outside the Capitol with promises to escalate if opposed by police. 99 By January 1 Stone recorded a video for his Stop The Steal Security Project to raise funds for the staging the transportation and most importantly the security of the event. 100  The event was largely funded by Trump donor Julie Jenkins Fancelli the 72yearold heiress to the Publix supermarket fortune who budgeted 3 million for the event and spent at least 650000. 101 Fancellis funding via conspiracy theorist Alex Jones was used to reserve the Ellipse. With Fancellis funding a robocall campaign was initiated urging people to march to the Capitol building and call on Congress to stop the steal. 102 Charlie Kirk another Fancellifunded activist stated that his group had sent over eighty buses to the Capitol. 103 Jones claimed that the Trump White House asked him to lead the march to the Capitol. 104  On January 2 Trump announced plans to speak at the March to Save America rally on January 6. f 105 106 107 On January 4 Steve Bannon described himself being part of the bloodless coup. 108 109  On November 5 2020 two days after the presidential election leaders of the Oath Keepers began communicating about a civil war. On November 9 the leaders held an online membersonly video conference in which leader Stewart Rhodes outlined a plan to stop the transfer of power including preparations for using force. The Oath Keepers planned to store an arsenal with a Quick Reaction Force QRF in nearby Alexandria Virginia. The leaders planned to procure boat transportation so that bridge closures could not prevent their entry into D.C. 110 111 112 113  On December 12 about 200 members of the Proud Boys joined a march near Freedom Plaza and the Trump International Hotel while dressed in combat fatigues and ballistic vests and reportedly carrying helmets. 114 In scuffles between protesters and counterprotesters four people were stabbed and at least 23 were arrested. 115  By December 15 Proud Boy members were being photographed wearing apparel featuring the antisemitic NeoNazi slogan 6MWE. 116 The acronym stands for 6 million wasnt enough referring to the number of Jewish Holocaust victims. The slogan was accompanied by an Eagle and fasces symbol used by the Italian Fascists. 116 The image which spread on Twitter prompted the AntiDefamation League to declare that the Proud Boyss Bigotry is on Full Display. 117  On December 19 Oath Keepers leader Kelly Meggs placed a call to Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio. 118 On December 20 the Proud Boys leadership handpicked members to form a new chapter called the Ministry of Self Defense which would be in charge of national rally planning. 119 120 121 That day one leader posted a message saying I am assuming most of the protest will be at the capital sic building given whats going on inside. 122 The Proud Boys leadership began encouraging members to attend the January 6 event. Leaders used a crowdfunding website to raise money and purchase paramilitary equipment such as concealed tactical vests and radio equipment in preparation for the attack. Chapter leadership spent the days prior to and the morning of January 6 planning the attack. 120 On December 29 leaders announced plans to be incognito on January 6 by not wearing their traditional black and yellow garb. 120 123 On December 30 the leadership received a document titled 1776 Returns which called for the occupation of crucial buildings on January 6 and argued for supporters to Storm the Winter Palace in an apparent reference to an attack on the Capitol. 124 On January 3 and 4 Proud Boys leadership explicitly discussed storming the Capitol. 120  On January 3 Rhodes departed his home in Texas having spent 6000 on a rifle and other firearms equipment in Texas and spending an additional 4500 in Mississippi enroute to D.C. On January 5 leaders began unloading weapons for the QRF in Alexandria. Leaders drove into D.C. on a reconnaissance mission before returning to their hotel in Virginia. 110 On January 4 Tarrio was arrested by D.C. police in connection with a prior destructionofproperty charge. Fearing that the police would access Tarrios messaging apps leadership deleted the old group chat and created a new one with one leader opining Well at least they wont get our boots on ground plans because we are one step ahead of them. Tarrio was released on January 5 and ordered to leave the city. Rather than immediately comply he traveled to an underground parking garage to meet with Oath Keepers leader Stewart Rhodes. 120 125  The night of January 5 Proud Boys leaders divided members into teams passed out radios and programmed the radios to specific channels in preparation. Orders were issued to assemble at 10 a.m. at the Washington Monument. Leadership warned members to avoid police and not to drink in public. 126 On January 6 about 100 plainclothes members assembled at the Washington Monument and were led to the Capitol to participate in the attack. 120  The weeks preceding January 6 were filled with predictions of upcoming violence by Trumps supporters. The attack was later said to be planned in plain sight with extensive postings on social media calling for and even planning for violence on January 6. In response to widespread predictions of possible violence D.C. food and lodging establishments with a history of being patronized by the Proud Boys announced temporary closures in an attempt to protect public safety and the mayor advised residents to stay away from areas near the Mall that might see violence. Members of Congress interfaced with law enforcement to ensure preparations were being made for any upcoming violence. Commentators had long feared that Trump might provoke violence after an electoral loss. g 127 For several weeks before January 6 there were over one million mentions of storming the Capitol on social media including calls for violence against Congress Pence and the police. 128 129 99 Many of the posters planned for violence before the event some discussed how to avoid police on the streets which tools to bring to help pry open doors and how to smuggle weapons into the city. 129 They discussed their perceived need to attack the police. 128 130 131  On December 28 2020 a map was posted showing entrances and exits to the Capitol and the tunnels that connect it to nearby House and Senate office buildings. Perimeters were drawn in red orange and yellow designed to reflect their relative importance while black Xs represented forces that would be ready for action if Congress tried to certify the 2020 presidential election. 131 On January 1 the operator of an obscure website about tunnels under the Capitol noticed a huge spike in traffic to the site prompting him to notify the FBI of a likely upcoming attack on the building. 134  From December 29 to January 5 the FBI and its field offices warned of armed protests at every state capitol and reported plans by Trump supporters that included violence. 135 On December 30 2020 one popular comment was posted saying Im thinking it will be literal war on that day. Where well storm offices and physically remove and even kill all the D.C. traitors and reclaim the country. 127 That comment was highlighted in a January 2 article by The Daily Beast which reported protesters were discussing bringing guns to the District breaking into federal buildings and attacking law enforcement. 127 136 In the days leading up to the attack several organizations including ones that monitor online extremism issued warnings about the event. 137  On January 5 the media published stories about widespread predictions of violence and D.C. mayor Bowser called for residents to avoid the downtown area where protesters would march. 138 That day members of Congress reached out to law enforcement charged with protecting the Capitol against possible upcoming violence and were assured that Capitol Police were prepared. 139  Three days before the Capitol attack the Capitol Police intelligence unit circulated a 12page internal memo warning that Trump supporters see the day of the Electoral College vote count as the last opportunity to overturn the results of the presidential election and could use violence against Congress itself on that date. 140  On November 9 Trump fired Secretary of Defense Mark Esper and replaced him with Christopher C. Miller as acting secretary. 141 142 143 144 In response to the firing Central Intelligence Agency CIA director Gina Haspel privately told Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley that we are on the way to a rightwing coup. 145 On December 18 Miller unilaterally terminated the Department of Defenses transition to the incoming administration falsely claiming it was a mutuallyagreed pause for the holidays. 146 147  On January 2 Senator Mitt Romney contacted Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell predicting that reinforcements would be denied. Wrote Romney ... a senior official at the Pentagon... reports that they are seeing very disturbing social media traffic regarding the protests planned on the 6th. There are calls to burn down your home Mitch to smuggle guns into DC and to storm the Capitol. I hope that sufficient security plans are in place but I am concerned that the instigator the President is the one who commands the reinforcements the DC and Capitol police might require. 148  On January 3 all ten living former defense secretaries released an open letter in which they expressed concerns about a potential military coup to overturn the election results mentioning the recentlyappointed acting secretary of defense Christopher Miller by name. 149 That day Trump ordered Miller to do whatever was necessary to protect the demonstrators on January 6. The next day Miller signed a memo severely limiting the ability of the D.C. National Guard to deploy without his personal permission. 150 Since his appointment in March 2018 D.C. National Guard commanding major general William J. Walker had standing orders to respond to civil disturbances in the district but on January 5 Walker received new orders from Secretary of the Army Ryan McCarthy forbidding him to respond to a civil disturbance without explicit prior approval from McCarthy and Miller. 151 Previously he had authority to respond without first seeking permission. 151 152 After the attack Walter described the order as unusual noting It required me to seek authorization from the secretary of the Army and the secretary of defense to essentially protect my guardsmen. 151  On January 4 D.C. mayor Bowser announced that the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia MPD would lead law enforcement in the district and would coordinate with the Capitol Police the U.S. Park Police and the Secret Service. 153 Jurisdictionally the Metropolitan Police Department is responsible for city streets of the National Mall and Capitol area whereas the Park Police are responsible for the Ellipse the site of Trumps speech and rally that day the Secret Service is responsible for the vicinity of the White House and the Capitol Police is responsible for the Capitol complex itself. 153 During a meeting with a representative of the Capitol Police the Mayor asked Where does your perimeter start?. At that point the individual left room and stopped participating in the conference. The mayor later recalled That should have been like a trigger to me. Like these people they dont want to answer questions about their preparation. 154  On January 6 under orders from leadership the Capitol Police deployed without less lethal arms such as sting grenades. The Capitol Police armory was not properly maintained. Department riot shields had been improperly stored at the wrong temperature rendering them ineffective while ammunition stores were expired. 155  On January 5 several events related to overturning the election occurred on or near the National Mall in Washington D.C. at places such as Freedom Plaza the North Inner Gravel Walkway between 13th and 14th Streets Area 9 across from the Russell Senate Office Building and near the United States Supreme Court. 156 157 On the night of January 5 and into the morning of January 6 at least ten people were arrested several on weapons charges. 158  On January 5 Ray Epps an individual with a history in the Arizona Oath Keepers was filmed during two street gatherings urging people to go into the Capitol the next day peacefully he said at one of the gatherings. 159 160 Epps was filmed on January 6 telling people to go to the Capitol. 159 Epps had texted his nephew that he was orchestrating the flow into the Capitol building. 161 Epps later claimed that he had been boasting about directing people towards the Capitol. 162  From 100 to 500 p.m. on January 5 a series of Trump rallies were held at Freedom Plaza. 156 Notable speakers included Alex Jones Michael Flynn George Papadopoulos and Roger Stone. 163  Both Flynn and Stone had received presidential pardons in prior weeks. On December 8 Trump pardoned retired U. S. Army lieutenant general Michael Flynn who had pleaded guilty to willfully and knowingly making false statements to the FBI about communications with the Russian ambassador. Flynn a prominent QAnon proponent participated in the D.C. events on January 5 while his brother U.S. Army general Charles Flynn would participate in a conference call on January 6 when he would refuse permission to deploy the National Guard after the breach of the Capitol. 164 On December 23 Trump pardoned Roger Stone who had been found guilty at trial of witness tampering making false statements to Congress and obstruction. Stone who had longtime ties to both the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers employed Oath Keepers as security on January 5. 165 Stones OathKeeper driver was later convicted of seditious conspiracy for his role in plotting and executing the following days attack. 166  In the evening of January 5 Trumps closest allies including Michael Flynn Corey Lewandowski Alabama senator Tommy Tuberville and Trumps sons Donald Jr. and Eric met at the Trump International Hotel in Washington D.C. 167 168 Tuberville has since said that he did not attend the meeting 169 despite having been photographed in the hotels lobby. 167 170 According to Charles Herbster who said he attended the meeting himself attendees included Tuberville Adam Piper and Peter Navarro. Daniel Beck wrote that Fifteen of us spent the evening with Donald Trump Jr. Kimberly Guilfoyle Tommy Tuberville Mike Lindell Peter Navarro and Rudy Giuliani. 171 Herbster claimed to be standing in the private residence of the President at Trump International with the following patriots who are joining me in a battle for justice and truth. He added David Bossie to the list of attendees. 167  At 740 p.m. on January 5 someone wearing a gray hooded sweatshirt a face mask and Nike Air Max Speed Turf sneakers was filmed carrying a bag through a residential neighborhood on South Capitol Street. At 752 p.m. the individual was recorded sitting on a bench outside the DNC the next day a pipe bomb was discovered there placed under a bush. In the footage the suspect appears to zip a bag stand and walk away. At 814 the suspect was filmed in an alley near the RNC where a second pipe bomb was found the following day. 173 Both bombs were placed within a few blocks of the Capitol. 174 175 Nearing the second anniversary of the incident a reward of 500000 was being offered 176 but as of the third anniversary no suspects have been named. 177 178 179  On January 6 the Save America rally or March to Save America promoted as a Save America March 180 took place on the Ellipse within the National Mall just south of the White House. The permit granted to Women for America First scheduled a first amendment rally March for Trump with speeches running from 900 a.m. to 330 p.m. with an additional hour for the conclusion of the rally and dispersal of participants. 156  Trump supporters gathered on the Ellipse to hear speeches from Trump Rudy Giuliani and others such as Chapman University School of Law professor John C. Eastman who spoke at least in part based on his memorandums which have been described as an instruction manual for a coup d tat. 181 182 In a court filing in February a member of the Oath Keepers claimed she had acted as security at the rally and was provided with a VIP pass to the rally where she met with Secret Service agents.

January 6 U.S. Capitol attack storming of the United States Capitol on January 6 2021 by a mob of supporters of Republican Pres. Donald J. Trump. The attack disrupted a joint session of Congress convened to certify the results of the presidential election of 2020 which Trump had lost to his Democratic opponent Joe Biden. Because its object was to prevent a legitimate presidentelect from assuming office the attack was widely regarded as an insurrection or attempted coup d tat. The Federal Bureau of Investigation FBI and other lawenforcement agencies also considered it an act of domestic terrorism. For having given a speech before the attack in which he encouraged a large crowd of his supporters near the White House to march to the Capitol and violently resist Congress s certification of Biden s victory which many in the crowd then did Trump was impeached by the Democraticled House of Representatives for incitement of insurrection he was subsequently acquitted by the Senate. The conduct of the 2020 presidential election was significantly affected by the deadly COVID19 pandemic in the United States the early stages of which coincided with the first presidential primary elections in February and March. Because of the evident risk to public health governors and election officials in several states postponed primary elections or implemented changes to election procedures to enable voters to cast their ballots safely. Among such measures were extending earlyvoting periods and loosening or eliminating requirements for obtaining or casting absentee mailin ballots which millions of voters were expected to use as a safer alternative to inperson voting. Correctly anticipating that Democratic voters would be more likely than Republican voters to use absentee ballots in part because Trump had repeatedly downplayed the extent of the pandemic and the seriousness of the illness the Trump campaign the Republican National Committee RNC and Republican leaders in several states filed scores of lawsuits alleging that the changes undermined the constitutional authority of state legislatures to make election law or that they invited individual voter fraud. Nearly all of the suits were dismissed or withdrawn. Amid those failed challenges Trump continued to falsely claim that Democrats were plotting to rig the election through voter fraud and by systematically forging altering or discarding absentee ballots among other illegal means. His accusations were of a piece with his frequent assertions during the 2016 presidential campaign that the election of that year which he won would be rigged by Democrats. In a press encounter in the early morning of November 4 the day after the election Trump maintained his false narrative of Democratic cheating by declaring himself the winner and denouncing the ongoing counting of absentee ballots as a fraud on the American people. During the next several weeks he continually accused Biden and the Democrats of having stolen the presidential election and repeated conspiracy theories involving ballot stuffing dead voters and malicious votingmachine software that deleted or changed millions of votes for Trump. His false accusations were indirectly endorsed by several Republican members of Congress who expressed uncertainty about the election s outcome or who simply refused to publicly acknowledge Biden s victory. Their calculated reticence helped to spread false doubts about the integrity of the election among rankandfile Republicans. Such manufactured doubts were later cited by Republican governors and election officials in several states to justify new election integrity laws that made it harder for some Democrats to vote and easier for partisan state legislatures to improperly influence or overturn statewide elections see voter suppression. As vote counting continued various groups of radicalized Trump supporters quickly coalesced around the idea that forceful protests and even violent direct action were necessary to stop the counting of fraudulent ballots and thereby to prevent Biden from taking office. A shortlived Facebook group calling itself Stop the Steal was created on November 4 and grew to some 320000 members in less than 24 hours before the social media company shut it down because of posts containing disinformation and calls for violence see also collective violence. Stop the Steal enthusiasts soon migrated to other social media venues where they repeated and elaborated conspiracy theories about the election and organized ontheground demonstrations in several cities including at polling stations where supposedly fraudulent vote counting was underway. After the electors from each state cast their votes for president and vice president on December 14 giving Biden a victory of 306 electoral votes to 232 Trump and his allies as well as leaders of Stop the Steal and other proTrump groups across the country turned their attention to the last formal step in the election of a U.S. president the ceremonial opening and counting of the electoral votes of each state in a joint session of Congress presided over by the vice president and commencing on January 6 a date fixed in federal law. Some allies reportedly advised Trump incorrectly that the vice president s role in the electoralvote counting would give Trump s vice president Mike Pence the constitutional authority to replace Democratic slates of electors with Republican ones and thereby to block Congress s confirmation of Biden s victory. Meanwhile in several tweets beginning in midDecember Trump encouraged his supporters to attend a rally and march on January 6 to protest the votecounting ceremony. In one of the tweets Trump stated Be there will be wild! At the rally held at a public park near the White House a crowd of thousands which included members of paramilitary organizations and other rightwing extremists listened to speeches by Trump s personal attorney Rudy Giuliani and Trump s sons Donald Jr. and Eric among others. In his own address which began at about noon Trump repeated wellworn falsehoods and conspiracy theories about the stolen election called on Pence to block Congress s confirmation of the electoral college vote declaring that if Pence failed to act the rally crowd would not let the confirmation take place We re just not going to let that happen encouraged the crowd to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol building and urged his audience to fight like hell or you re not going to have a country anymore. Although Trump did not explicitly direct those in attendance to commit illegal acts his generally incendiary language plainly suggested to many in the crowd that they would be justified in violently attacking the Capitol and members of Congress to prevent Biden from becoming president. Even before Trump finished his address shortly after 100 pm and just as the joint session of Congress was being convened a mob of his supporters including members of rightwing extremist organizations such as the Proud Boys the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters as well as selfidentified adherents of the QAnon conspiracy theory pushed through fences at the western perimeter of the Capitol grounds forcing Capitol Police officers to retreat to additional barricades closer to the building see United States The 2020 U.S. election and United States presidential election of 2020 Aftermath Trump s refusal to concede and the insurrection at the Capitol. The mob grew larger as ever more people arrived from the rally at which Trump had spoken. Capitol Police officers along with reinforcements from the Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia were overwhelmed. Many officers were brutally beaten with deadly weapons bats pipes and flag poles sprayed with chemical irritants or crushed and trampled by the surging crowd. As the rioting continued outside the joint session was temporarily adjourned to allow the House and Senate to separately debate a Republican challenge to the Democratic slate of electors from Arizona. By about 200 pm the rioters had breached the last barrier on the west side of the building and were running up the Capitol steps and scaling the walls of the West Terrace. Another mob also had broken through barriers on the east side of the Capitol. Shortly after 200 pm the rioters shattered windows to break into the west side of the building and for the next few hours they vandalized and looted the interior and ransacked offices as they searched for their perceived enemies in Congress. They also looked for Pence whom they now denounced as a traitor for having refused to interfere in Congress s tabulation of electoral votes. Shortly before the start of the joint session Pence had released a letter in which he stated that it is my considered judgment that my oath to support and defend the Constitution constrains me from claiming unilateral authority to determine which electoral votes should be counted and which should not. At about 220 pm Trump condemned Pence in a tweet to his followers claiming that Mike Pence didn t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution. Only minutes after the breakin members of the House and Senate were notified that protesters had entered the building. Realizing that their lives were in danger many lawmakers fled or were evacuated from the building or hid behind desks or in barricaded offices and even closets. Pence was evacuated to a secure location within the complex. The governors of Virginia and Maryland eventually dispatched National Guard units and state troopers to assist in securing the building because of bureaucratic delays the District of Columbia National Guard was not mobilized until about three hours after the start of the attack. The Capitol was finally cleared of rioters at about 6 pm some four hours after they first entered the building. The vast majority of the attackers were not arrested onsite and simply walked away. Congress then resumed its tabulation of electoral votes after dismissing Republican challenges to the slates of electors from Arizona and Pennsylvania and Biden was certified as the winner of the 2020 presidential election in the early morning hours of January 7. The attack on the Capitol was broadcast live on major news networks. Trump himself watched some of the assault and reportedly was pleased and excited by what he saw. After initially resisting pressure from White House aides and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy to condemn the attack Trump reluctantly tweeted at about 240 pm a call to his followers to support the Capitol Police and to stay peaceful. A similar tweet was issued about half an hour later. At about 420 pm Trump tweeted a brief video in which he once again asserted that the election had been stolen. Expressing his love for the rioters he urged them to go home stating that we have to have peace. Later that day he tweeted These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love in peace. Remember this day forever! On January 8 Trump was banned from Twitter for having posted tweets before during and after the assault that violated the company s policy against glorification of violence. The ban was rescinded after Elon Musk took over the social media company. According to a Justice Department report released in July 2021 approximately 140 Capitol and Metropolitan police officers were criminally assaulted by the rioters in the January 6 attack. Among those victims one died of a series of strokes after being hospitalized for injuries sustained in the attack and two others committed suicide. One of the rioters was shot and killed by police another died of a heart attack and a third was apparently crushed to death by the stampeding mob. The rioters caused an estimated 1.5 million in damage to the Capitol building. On January 13 2021 the House of Representatives by a vote of 232 to 197 adopted a single article of impeachment against Trump for incitement of insurrection. At his Senate trial in February which began three weeks after he left office on January 20 Trump was acquitted after only 57 senators 10 short of the required twothirds majority voted to find him guilty. During the first year after the attack the FBI and the Justice Department arrested more than 725 of the rioters charging them with a variety of federal crimes including injuring lawenforcement officers destruction and theft of government property and conspiracy to obstruct a congressional proceeding. As of early January 2022 the FBI had yet to identify and apprehend more than 350 additional persons believed to have committed violent crimes on the Capitol grounds. In May 2021 Senate Republicans blocked passage of a Housepassed bill that would have created a national commission to investigate the January 6 attack claiming that it would unnecessarily duplicate ongoing investigations by two Senate committees and the Justice Department the Senate investigation however was focused on intelligence and communication failures by lawenforcement agencies prior to the attack. In response the House voted along nearparty lines to create its own committee the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. After Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi refused to seat two of the Republican representatives chosen by minority leader Kevin McCarthy to serve on the committee investigating the January 6th attack Jim Jordan and Jim Banks McCarthy withdrew his other nominees and sought to block Republican involvement in the committee which he branded a sham process. When Representatives Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney ignored that directive the Republican National Committee censured them and McCarthy saw that Cheney was stripped of her leadership role within the party. The committee began holding hearings in July and by early January 2022 the committee had interviewed more than 300 people and collected thousands of pages of records related to the attack. It had also subpoenaed testimony and records from highlevel members of the Trump administration and other Trump associates and supporters some of whom refused to cooperate with the investigation. In October 2021 Trump filed suit against the committee in federal district court seeking to block the release of several hundred pages of records relating to his activities and communications before and during the attack which the committee had originally requested in August. In December after the district court rejected Trump s request and an appellate court upheld that decision Trump filed an emergency petition with the Supreme Court asking that it review the district court s ruling and that it block release of the documents pending its final decision in the case. The Supreme Court denied Trump s request in January 2022 allowing the committee to begin receiving the documents from the National Archives. See also Donald J. Trump Presidential election of 2020.
