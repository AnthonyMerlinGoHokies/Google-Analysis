https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/court-ruling-daca-illegal-program-hasnt-ended-4-things-know-rcna105085, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ruled Wednesday night that recent efforts by the Biden administration to turn the Obamaera program into a federal regulation were unlawful.  The ruling was deeply upsetting Areli Hernandez a longtime DACA recipient from Los Angeles and the director of executive affairs at the immigrant rights organization CHIRLA said at a news briefing Thursday organized by several immigrant and civil rights groups. Former DACA recipient Bruna Sollod a senior political director at United We Dream the country s largest immigrant youthled organization said Imagine hundreds of thousands of young people who have jobs right now have mortgages car payments small businesses and clients that rely on them. That has a huge impact on the economy and on communities across this country.   I don t know what else we need to say to make elected officials and the Biden administration understand the threat that we are facing Sollod said.  The programs fate is still uncertain as the sixyear court battle continues to play out in courts after legal challenges from the Trump administration and nine Republicanled states seeking to fully end DACA.  Here are four important things to know about who is affected and whats at stake. While the roughly 580000 current recipients can continue to renew their DACA status every two years the program is closed for new applicants. While Hanen whom President George W. Bush nominated in 2002 has ruled DACA illegal multiple times he has refrained from fully terminating it. The latest ruling continues to allow DACA recipients to file renewal applications while the case is pending appeal said Andrea Senteno the regional counsel at the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund better known as MALDEF. MALDEF has been representing 22 DACA recipients since 2018 in the legal challenge brought by the Republicanled states of Alabama Arkansas Kansas Louisiana Mississippi Nebraska South Carolina Texas and West Virginia. Alongside attorneys from the federal government and New Jersey MALDEF has argued that the states have failed to prove injuries from DACAs implementation and that the initiative is a lawful exercise of presidential discretion Senteno said. In 2020 the Supreme Court ruled 54 that the Trump administration improperly ended DACA in 2017 allowing it to stay in place. They wont lose their status as long as they continue to renew their DACA in a timely manner. Current recipients or those whose DACA status expired less than a year ago can continue to renew it every two years. Those who miss the window to renew would be able to reapply only as new applicants but that isn t currently allowed.  Sometimes people fall out of the DACA status because they don t renew on time due to finances or due to the inability to access the correct legal resources Hernandez said. Unfortunately this decision from Judge Hanen also affects those who were not able to renew their DACA with sufficient time.  An estimated 400000 people who would have been eligible to apply for the first time haven t had access to DACA since 2021 according to an analysis by FWD.us a bipartisan group supporting immigration reform. Among the 400000 people shut out of the DACA program are nearly 93000 firsttime applicants who have been left in limbo for the past two years. They had submitted the necessary paperwork and paid the required 495 fee to apply for the program shortly before Hanen closed it for new applicants. Since DACA started in 2012 recipients have contributed 108 billion to the economy as well as 33 billion in combined taxes according to FWD.us.  It strengthens our economy our communities and provides a way for people who came as children to work study live their lives and support their families said Vanessa C rdenas the executive director of the immigrant advocacy organization America s Voice.  An overwhelming majority of DACA recipients were born in Mexico followed by other Latin American countries according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. A smaller but significant number are from Asian countries such as the Philippines India Pakistan and Indonesia.  Hanen s ruling is likely to be appealed to the Supreme Court sending DACA before the court for a third time. As of Thursday afternoon MALDEF had no timeline for the appeals process. Senteno said it is reviewing closely the decision and preparing and discussing what the next steps will be alongside attorneys from the federal government and those representing plaintiffs in New Jersey. In the meantime DACA recipients and immigrant rights advocates have continued to push for a pathway to citizenship.  We need a permanent solution that will recognize our humanity our roots and our contributions to this nation Hernandez said. Sen. Alex Padilla DCalif. introduced a bill in July that could provide permanent residency or green cards to more than 8 million noncitizens by updating a provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act known as registry. That would allow immigrants who have been continuously present in the U.S. for at least 7 years to apply for permanent residency. A House version of the bill was introduced this year. Glo Choi a community organizer at HANA Center a nonprofit group advocating for Koreans Asian American and immigrant communities said he believes the bills are the best option to provide legal status to DACA recipients and other kinds of undocumented immigrants. We believe that all of us are deserving of living free with dignity in the place that we call home Choi said. A bill reintroduced by Rep. Sylvia Garcia DTexas in June seeks to provide a pathway to citizenship for DACA recipients and other immigrants with other kinds of immigration protections. Versions of the bill passed in the House last year and in 2021 C rdenas said adding it could pass it again if at least nine Republicans support it alongside Democrats. Supporters of DACA say it s one of the most successful policies for immigrant integration. Most DACA recipients have lived in the U.S. for more than 16 years.   They are no longer kids. They are raising families of their own and are well into their careers C rdenas said. The average DACA recipient is 26 to 28 years old said Gaby Pacheco the director of advocacy development and communications at TheDream.Us an organization helping young immigrants complete college.  Those who are at the top of the DACA population are now in their early 40s Hernandez said. And those who are in their mid to early 20s can t access DACA anymore.  DACA recipients are also parents to more than 200000 U.S. citizen children. Among them is Angel Reyes a DACA recipient from Long Island who is an organizing coordinator at Make the Road New York.  That s what I m thinking about the most Reyes said. Without a permanent solution to regulate the immigration status of DACA recipients Reyes fears he could be separated from his two U.S. citizen children. That fear brings him back to when he was a 17yearold in high school and his mother was deported to Peru.  That was one of the most difficult moments that I experienced if not the most difficult moment I experienced in my life said Reyes who is also a business owner.

https://www.fwd.us/news/what-if-daca-ends/, Despite DACA s overwhelming success the future of the policy and the Dreamers protected by it is facing urgent legal threats. A federal judge in Texas ruled in 2021 that the DACA policy is unlawful barring the government from accepting new applications for now current DACA holders are still permitted to renew their status every two years as outlined by the original policy. In October the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed with the lower court s decision finding the DACA policy is unlawful but permitted renewals to continue while the Texas court reviews the case again. As DACA continues to be litigated in the courts analysis by FWD.us makes clear the severe damage to the U.S. economy and to millions of U.S. families that would occur if DACA ends or if DACA renewals are not allowed to continue.1 A critical aspect of DACA and a driving force for much of its success is that DACA provides recipients access to employment authorization documents allowing them to pursue employment in the United States as well as making them eligible for certain benefits like a driver s license. If DACA ended or renewals were restricted current DACA recipients would lose their work authorization and all ancillary privileges that allow them to travel safely and take care of vital daily activities like driving their kids to school or taking family members to doctor s visits. Because DACA renewals are granted on a rolling basis local communities would almost immediately feel the impact if renewals were blocked. An estimated 22000 jobs would be lost each and every month for two years about 1000 jobs each business day at a time when workforce shortages are already hurting families and driving up costs across the country. If DACA renewals are halted this means that each month for two years some 1600 DACA recipients working in healthcare including doctors and nurses 800 educational professionals like teachers and teacher aides and 600 personal care workers in child or senior care would be forced out of their jobs which would be devastating to communities across the country. Even now the number of people protected by DACA is shrinking. The policy is closed to new applications due to legal challenges prohibiting nearly 400000 Dreamers who should be eligible to receive DACA protections from applying for them. For example some 93000 new initial applications for DACA are pending adjudication at United States Citizenship and Immigration Services because their processing has been halted by the courts. Currently only renewals are being processed and even then the rules for age and arrival date have remained unchanged for more than a decade meaning the DACA policy is largely frozen to new applicants. Consequently while DACA recipients who received protections early on many as students are now building careers the postDACA generation of Dreamers is entering adulthood with far fewer opportunities. For example FWD.us estimates that only a quarter of the 100000 undocumented high school graduates in 2022 would be eligible for DACA if new applications were being processed. California and Texas home to the highest numbers of DACA recipients would suffer the highest number of job losses if DACA ended with an estimated 6000 monthly job losses in California and 5000 in Texas. In Texas this means 400 healthcare workers and 300 teachers would be forced out of their jobs each month. Among other top states of DACA recipients the monthly job losses would amount to 1000 individuals in Illinois 800 in New York 800 in Arizona 700 each in Florida and North Carolina 600 in Georgia and 500 each in Washington and Colorado with terrible ripple effects for DACA recipients families and broader communities. Because the DACA renewal period is 24 months job losses would continue and compound over those two years. When the last DACA recipient s work permit expires the U.S. will have lost more than half a million jobs and the U.S. economy will lose as much as 11.7 billion annually or roughly 1 billion monthly in wages from previously employed DACA recipients. Economic losses from DACA s ending would represent only the tip of the iceberg. Because most DACA recipients have lived in the U.S. for two decades or more losing DACA would hurt families across the country with farreaching harm for nearly every community in the U.S. DACA recipients have deep roots in their local communities. Most are in their thirties or will soon be approaching them. They own homes here have started businesses and are raising their kids and building their families. Critically many DACA recipients have children and spouses who are U.S. citizens. If DACA renewals were halted DACA recipients could lose their protections from deportation putting them at immediate risk. This means an estimated 25000 U.S. citizen children each month would be living with a parent at risk of being torn from their families and deported to a country they likely don t even remember. Similarly an estimated 5000 U.S. citizens have a spouse who would lose deportation protections. This means each day for two years nearly 1000 immediate U.S. citizen family members will see a loved one at immediate risk of deportation. This would mean 6000 U.S. citizen children in California and a further 5000 in Texas would have a parent becoming eligible for deportation each month for two years. It would mean that each month for two years 1500 U.S. citizen spouses of DACA recipients in California and 1000 in Texas could see their spouses deported. Even these large numbers tell only part of the story. Living with the threat of deportation places an enormous burden on family members and children compromising their ability to concentrate at work or school and adding terrible stress and fear to their daily lives. The threat to DACA recipients is real and it s right in front of us. While Dreamers have long been stuck in a precarious position the current legal threats to DACA have put the policy in greater danger than ever. Congress must pass a permanent legislative solution in 2022 to protect Dreamers or Dreamers futures in this country and the futures of their families and communities will be in great peril. Ending DACA would severely damage businesses across the country. Hospitals would be unable to serve as many patients. Classrooms would lose their teachers. And families of all backgrounds would experience the enormous stress of losing loved ones to deportation. DACA faces the imminent risk of being ended threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of young people. It is imperative that eligible DACA recipients continue to renew their DACA as soon as possible and that Congress act this year. We urge all parties to do their part to support these crucial efforts.

The ruling does not end the program but extends an already yearslong legal battle over its existence.  Current DACA recipients are still eligible to reapply for the legal protections that allow them to stay and work in the United States. New applications remain halted stuck in limbo since 2021. The ruling will likely be appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.  Pratheepan Deep Gulasekaram a professor of constitutional law and immigration law at CU Boulder studies the constitutional rights of noncitizens and has written multiple books on immigration policy. Gulasekaram offers his take on what this latest ruling means for DACA recipients and the state of immigration in the United States.   DACA was announced by the Obama administration back in 2012. At that time Barack Obama s administration was already creating enforcement priorities for immigration which are guidelines for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Those guidelines classified people who were young who were students or who had no felony background as the lowest priority for deportation.  Despite the publication of these priorities many people who fell under lowpriority were still caught up in ICE s enforcement dragnet. So in 2012 Obama announced the creation of the DACA program. DACA created a set of eligibility criteria that if met allowed young undocumented people to apply for deferred action shielding them from deportation for two years. Further recipients could apply to renew their DACA grant after that initial period. Importantly at that time DACA was created as a memorandum from the Secretary of Homeland Security. Something that wasn t specifically listed in the memorandum but is immensely important to the importance of DACA and current litigation about the programs legality is work authorization. Once someone has deferred action they can apply to receive authorization to work during the time they maintain DACA. DACA was not challenged for quite some time really until near the beginning of President Donald Trump s administration. The state of Texas along with several other states with Republican governors or attorneys general challenged the program in a federal district court in Texas. That court was specifically chosen for the judge U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen because he had previously ruled on and rejected an extension of DACA that Obama tried to enact several years before.  Hanen ruled that DACA was illegal in part because of the way it was created as a memorandum from the Department of Homeland Security and not a more involved process that complies with procedural rules and philosophy that usually accompany action from a federal agency. Despite finding DACA unlawful and preventing DHS from processing new applications however Hanen s ruling permitted those already with DACA to keep it and to seek renewal with DHS. Fast forward to 2021 when incoming President Joe Biden asked his Secretary of Homeland Security to shore up DACA by enacting through formal agency rulemaking. At that time Hanen s ruling was on appeal with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals. Noting that Biden s DHS had codified DACA through the formal rulemaking process the 5th Circuit kicked the case back down to Hanen to see if the codification of DACA altered the legality of the program. Hanen ruled that it did not. And so issued the ruling we have from Sept. 13 where he concludes the program is still illegal.  Importantly however just as with his initial ruling the most recent decision does not strip current DACA recipients of the program s protections and appears to still allow DACA renewals. And as with the prior ruling the federal government cannot process any new applications.  The Biden administration will no doubt appeal Hanen s ruling up to higher federal courts. Anybody who knows anything about immigration and the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals one of the most if not the most reactionary and conservative courts in the nation expects with near certainty that it will very quickly approve of and affirm Hanen s ruling. In the past the 5th Circuit has found extensions of the DACA program illegal and more generally has upheld enforcementheavy immigration policies. In fact given the 5th Circuit s track record a panel of judges might take it upon themselves to go even further than Hanen s ruling. For example they could agree that DACA is illegal and add that current recipients cannot continue to defer deportation. No matter what happens after the 5th Circuit ruling the White House will likely very quickly appeal to the Supreme Court.  Of course the makeup of the Supreme Court looks very different than it did when DACA started. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsberg Stephen Breyer and Anthony Kennedy are no longer on the court. It s much more likely the court has at least five votes and perhaps six to agree that DACA is illegal if the justices agree to take the case.  Then the question becomes What do we tell young undocumented people who have been here for years who ve studied and earned degrees at schools in the United States who know of no other country but this one and who were for the last decade gainfully employed or serving in our military? That s hundreds of thousands of people who currently have DACA status.  First the timing of potential litigation matters. If Biden is still in office the administration will appeal. It s hard to say if someone else in the office especially a Republican and specifically Donald Trump who previously attempted to rescind DACA would do the same.  It s also important to note that DACA recipients in particular and Dreamers in general have garnered a lot of sympathy amongst the American public. These are young people brought to the United States and its become a very popular program which is something candidates and Congress as well should consider. DREAM Act legislation is overwhelmingly popular with American voters but has thus far failed to pass in Congress.  If it is your belief that somehow removing DACA or any such protection is magically going to help with immigration enforcement it won t. There are 11 million people without lawful status in the United States. It s a false choice to believe that removing DACA protection will reduce that number or that people will somehow stop entering or remaining in the country unlawfully.  Ultimately if we dont find a solution not just for DACA recipients but for the unlawfully present population in general we are just going to deepen the immigration problem that we already have in the United States.

https://www.americanimmigrationcouncil.org/news/congress-must-pass-permanent-solution-and-expand-protections-dreamers-ruling-attempts-end-daca, WASHINGTON Sept. 14 2023 Yesterday Judge Andrew Hanen of the Southern District of Texas ruled that the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA program is unlawful and in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. This decision aims to terminate the DACA program and will leave thousands of undocumented youth in legal limbo without the ability to apply for work authorization drivers licenses and other protections that the DACA program offers.  Firsttime DACA applications were halted by an earlier court decision and yesterday s decision will permanently halt firsttime applications absent intervention from an appellate court. DACA renewals and advance parole applications however are allowed to continue. The U.S. government will likely appeal the decision to the court of appeals and the case may end up at the Supreme Court. A potential case would likely not arrive to the Supreme Court until the 2024 term placing a potential decision in May or June 2025. The American Immigration Council strongly advocates for Congress to pass a permanent solution for undocumented youth across the United States including those who participate in the DACA initiative. It has been more than 10 years since the creation of DACA which offered an opportunity for undocumented youth who meet strict criteria to apply for temporary protection from deportation.  The following statement is from Jorge Loweree managing director of programs at the American Immigration Council   Yesterday s decision was a major blow to thousands of our friends neighbors and colleagues that benefit from DACA s protections and the families and communities who rely on them. While the decision won t have an immediate impact on people who currently rely on the program to live and work in the U.S. without the constant threat of deportation it will continue to sow fear and distrust across the country. If Congress continues to sit on its hands waiting to be forced into action the Republicanled state effort to kill DACA by a thousand cuts will succeed. The time to act is now.   DACA recipients across the nation work in our hospitals teach our children manage our businesses and contribute to the fabric of our nation in countless ways. They have lived grown and put down roots under DACA s protections for over a decade. If we fail them we fail ourselves. It s time for Congress to finally deliver.  The American Immigration Council has a range of research and other resources on DACA including policy experts available to speak on policies designed to protect Dreamers and what is at stake for over 650000 DACA beneficiaries across the country. The Council also has data on demographic and economic contributions of DACA recipients in each U.S. state and nationwide.    For more information contact Andrea Ramos at the American Immigration Council email protected or 2025077508. The American Immigration Council works to strengthen America by shaping how America thinks about and acts towards immigrants and immigration and by working toward a more fair and just immigration system that opens its doors to those in need of protection and unleashes the energy and skills that immigrants bring. The Council brings together problem solvers and employs four coordinated approaches to advance change litigation research legislative and administrative advocacy and communications. In January 2022 the Council and New American Economy merged to combine a broad suite of advocacy tools to better expand and protect the rights of immigrants more fully ensure immigrants ability to succeed economically and help make the communities they settle in more welcoming.

Nicholas KammAFP via Getty Images hide caption   Activists demonstrate in front of the Supreme Court in Washington D.C. on Thursday as the court rejected the Trump administrations move to rescind the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. In a major rebuke to President Trump the U.S. Supreme Court has blocked the administrations plan to dismantle an Obamaera program that has protected 700000 socalled DREAMers from deportation. The vote was 54 with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the opinion. Under the Obama program qualified individuals brought to the U.S. as children were given temporary legal status if they graduated from high school or were honorably discharged from the military and if they passed a background check. Just months after taking office Trump moved to revoke the program only to be blocked by lower courts and now the Supreme Court. Roberts opinion for the court was a narrow but powerful rejection of the way the Trump administration went about trying to abolish the program known as Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA. We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies Roberts wrote. The wisdom of those decisions is none of our concern. Here we address only whether the Administration complied with the procedural requirements in the law that insist on a reasoned explanation for its action.  But as Roberts observed the attorney general offered no detailed justifications for canceling DACA. Nor did the acting secretary of homeland security at the time Elaine Duke who put out a memo announcing the rescission of DACA that relied entirely on Sessions opinion that the program was unlawful. As Roberts noted Dukes memo didnt address the fact that thousands of young people had come to rely on the program emerging from the shadows to enroll in degree programs embark on careers start businesses buy homes and even marry and have 200000 children of their own who are U.S. citizens not to mention that DACA recipients pay 60 billion in taxes each year. None of these concerns are dispositive Roberts said but they have to be addressed. The fact that they werent addressed made the decision to rescind DACA arbitrary and capricious he wrote. And none of the justifications the administration offered after the fact sufficed either including a memo issued by thenSecretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen. That memo said Roberts was essentially too little too late. An agency must defend its action based on the reasons it gave at the time it acted he said instead of when the case is already in court. Roberts made clear that an administration can rescind a program like DACA and indeed immigration experts dont disagree with that bottom line. The problem for the administration was that it never wanted to take responsibility for abolishing DACA and instead sought to blame the Obama administration for what it called an illegal and unconstitutional program. Joining the Roberts opinion were the courts four liberal justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen Breyer Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Sotomayor wrote separately to say that while she agreed that rescinding DACA violated the law for the procedural reasons outlined by the chief justice she would have allowed the litigants to return to the lower courts and make the case that rescinding DACA also amounted to unconstitutional discrimination. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote the principal dissent accusing Roberts of writing a political rather than a legal opinion. Joining him were Justices Neil Gorsuch and Samuel Alito with separate dissents also filed by Alito and Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In a tweet Trump blasted the decision as one of the horrible politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court. The president also asked Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesnt like me? These horrible politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives. We need more Justices or we will lose our 2nd. Amendment everything else. Vote Trump 2020! Former Vice President Joe Biden the presumptive Democratic nominee on the other hand celebrated the decision saying in a statement The Supreme Courts ruling today is a victory made possible by the courage and resilience of hundreds of thousands of DACA recipients who bravely stood up and refused to be ignored. In an interview with NPRs Mary Louise Kelly Ken Cuccinelli the Trump administration senior official who oversees immigration and citizenship at the Department of Homeland Security said Trump is considering his options. I do expect you will see some action out of the administration he said adding He is not a man who sits on his hands. While the decision gives DACA and its hundreds of thousands of recipients a lifeline the issue is far from settled. The court decided that the way Trump went about canceling DACA was illegal but all the justices seemed to agree that the president does have the authority to cancel the program if done properly. For now though more individuals eligible for DACA status may be able to apply. Marisol Orihuela codirector of the Worker Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic at Yale Law School notes that the administration has refused to accept new applications since 2017. But she thinks that will change now. Our understanding is that the program is restored to what it was in 2012 when it went into effect she says. Guttentag who teaches immigration law at Yale and Stanford University says if Trump is not reelected a new administration could repair much of the damage that he says has been inflicted on immigrants during the Trump administration. But he adds that the immigration system is completely shattered and needs fundamental reform. But aside from the president lots of Republicans are relieved as well. If Thursdays decision had gone the other way the pressure on congressional Republicans to pass legislation protecting the DREAMers would have been intense. DACA is an astonishingly popular program with recent polls showing up to 85 support among Democratic and independent voters and huge majorities among Republican voters as well. Indeed 200 major corporations filed briefs in the Supreme Court supporting the DACA recipients. Among them was Microsoft which was a plaintiff in one of the cases that made it to the Supreme Court and its president Brad Smith. There are more than 30000 DACA registrants working in the health space alone. Weve needed these people more than we do today he said. Every time I meet with them I have the same reaction. We are lucky as a country to have them. This raises profound issues of executive power and in effect sets out a ratchet whereby statutory changes can be enacted by presidential executive order but can only be rescinded through jumping through various administrative law hoops he said. At the end of the day the man of the hour is Chief Justice Roberts. Amid a politicized and polarized society he has repeatedly tried to portray the court as apolitical. He sees the growth of organizations on the hard right like the Judicial Crisis Network and on the hard left like Demand Justice each trying to stack the court with likeminded justices or pack the court by expanding the number of justices. What these decisions underscore is we have a chief justice whos plainly working hard to demonstrate to the American people that the court unlike the other two branches is doing its job and doing its best said Harvard Law School professor Richard Lazarus who has known the chief justice for decades. He wants the American people to believe there is a thing called law and justice. His job is to apply it. Read the decision here. Emmett WitkovskyEldred contributed to this report.

https://www.fwd.us/news/daca-court-case/, In February legal briefs were submitted by amici curiae or friends of the court detailing the devastating impacts that ending DACA would have on children and families communities and the economy. More than 450 individual amici including leaders in the business community higher education and state governments among many others are represented across seven briefs. If the court schedules oral arguments they could happen as early as Spring 2024 and a decision could be issued in the months following. The Supreme Court could decide within the next year whether to hear a case about the legality of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals DACA policy. In September 2023 Judge Andrew Hanen a federal judge in the U.S. Southern District of Texas who issued a ruling declaring that the DACA program is illegal. While Judge Hanen s most recent ruling does not impact DACA recipients current protections or their ability to continue to renew them the decision is another cruel and disheartening indication that the courts plan to terminate this vital lifeline for hundreds of thousands of young immigrants and their families. Judge Hanen s ruling is not the final step. An appeal of his ruling has been filed and is being heard by the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals which also previously ruled against DACA. Assuming the Fifth Circuit rules the same way again the case will then likely be appealed up to the Supreme Court. The timing of the Fifth Circuit s decision is unpredictable however and the timeline for the Supreme Court to respond to a request to review the case could range from anywhere late 2024 to early 2025 if such a request is granted the case may not be heard until spring 2025. Considering the current makeup of the Court and its previous immigration decisions there s a good chance the Justices could also rule against DACA. If the Court ultimately upholds Judge Hanen s ruling and if the Court prohibits the government from processing DACA renewals the 600000 current DACA recipients could be stripped of their ability to work legally and would be exposed to the threat of deportation. If DACA renewals are ended an estimated 1000 DACA recipients would be forced out of their jobs every week for the next two years. For half a decade DACA has faced protracted litigation that has created overwhelming uncertainty for current recipients and has prevented the government from processing requests from new applicants. The legal odyssey began in 2017 when thenAttorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Trump administration was ending the DACA policy. Several lawsuits were filed to keep DACA in place and federal judges decided in their favor determining that the Trump administration had violated federal procedure by ending DACA without a formal process. The Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to review the cases in 2020 the Court issued a 54 decision affirming that the Trump administration had not followed the proper procedures. This decision kept DACA in place though the Court deliberately said nothing about the underlying legality of the policy itself.  Meanwhile a separate legal challenge was launched by a coalition of Republican attorneys general. They sued the U.S. government arguing that the DACA policy is unlawful and directly harms their states. The case came before Judge Hanen in the Southern Texas District Court and in 2021 he sided with the states. Judge Hanen asserted that DACA was illegal because the Obama administration had skirted the formal rulemaking process and that DACA s protections went beyond the government s authority. Judge Hanen s 2021 decision prohibited the government from processing new applications but it allowed current DACA recipients to retain their protections and to file for renewals while the Biden administration went through a new formal rulemaking process to bolster the program. The Biden administration appealed Judge Hanen s decision in 2022 the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Judge Hanen s determination that the original DACA policy was unlawful but sent the case back to Judge Hanen to consider the legality of the new formal DACA rule issued by the Biden administration. Despite this new rulemaking process Judge Hanen has ruled again that DACA is illegal. The Biden administration has now appealed that decision requesting the Fifth Circuit to review the new ruling.  Seven amici curiae briefs are filed in the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals detailing the devastating impacts if the DACA policy is ended. An appeal is filed with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Texas v. United States case requesting review of Judge Hanen s recent ruling. Judge Hanen issues his ruling in the case of Texas v.

Judge Hanen hears oral arguments in the case of Texas v. United States focusing on the newly finalized DACA rule. A decision in the case is expected to follow in the coming months.

The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in Texas upholds Judge Hanen s determination that the 2012 DACA memorandum is unlawful but remands the case back to Judge Hanen to determine the legality of the newly finalized DACA rule. Oral argument takes place at the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals for the Texas v. United States case. DHS proposes a new DACA rule for public comment. The rule is in part an attempt to answer claims that DACA was not properly implemented by undergoing a formal rulemaking process with public notice and comment. The rule makes very little practical change to DACA. Judge Hanen issues his decision in the case of Texas v. United States declaring that DACA is unlawful because of procedural errors made in its implementation. Noting the reliance interest of current DACA recipients Hanen temporarily stays the injunction as to individuals who obtained DACA on or before July 16 2021 which in practice permits DACA renewals. He holds that DACA is inconsistent with statutory immigration law set forth under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Judge Hanen hears oral arguments in Texas v. United States the lawsuit challenging DACAs legality. New York District Court for the Eastern District of New York orders that DACA be fully reinstated in the Batalla Vidal case ordering DHS to continue accepting new applications and renewals. The Supreme Court issues a 54 decision finding that the Trump administration s termination of DACA was 1 judicially reviewable and 2 done in an arbitrary and capricious manner in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. The decision keeps DACA in place. The Supreme Court grants review of three petitions related to the Trump administration s attempts to end DACA Regents Batalla Vidal and NAACP. A three judge panel in the Ninth Circuit upholds the preliminary injunction issued in Regents of the University of California v. Department of Homeland Security that kept DACA renewals going. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs in the case were likely to prevail on their claim that the Trump administration s termination of DACA was arbitrary and capricious and therefore unlawful. The Trump administration requests a writ of certiorari for the second time in the case of Regents of the University of California et al. v. Department of Homeland Security and for the first time in the cases of Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen and NAACP v. Trump asking the Supreme Court to take up the cases before decisions are issued in the related appeals cases. At the end of their ninetyday deadline the United States District Court for the District of Columbia orders DHS to revive DACA. The court determined that the ending of DACA was arbitrary and capricious. The Trump administration is given twenty days to comply. Texas v.

The cases involved are NAACP v. Trump et al. and Trustees of Princeton et al. v. United States of America et al. The Supreme Court denies the Trump administration s request for a writ of certiorari in Regents of the University of California et al. v. Department of Homeland Security. The United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York issues an injunction against the Trump administration s attempt to end DACA blocking the repeal. The court rules that the Trump administration s attempt to repeal the initiative was arbitrary and capricious a decision which applies in the cases of Batalla Vidal v. Nielsen and State of New York v. Trump. The Trump administration files a petition for a writ of certiorari requesting the Supreme Court hear a direct appeal of the Regents of the University of California et al. v. Department of Homeland Security. United States District Court for the Northern District of California issues a preliminary injunction to prevent the Trump administration from ending DACA in the case of Regents of the University of California et al. v.

U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announces the Trump Administration s decision to end DACA. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton threatens to file a lawsuit against the federal government if the DACA policy is not rescinded by September 5th 2017. In that time DACA has been a transformative policy. With DACA the overwhelming majority of recipients has graduated high school and nearly half have attained some college education. Most DACA recipients are working more than threequarters of DACA recipients participate in the labor force contributing an estimated 13.3 billion to the U.S. economy each year. Some 300000 DACA recipients work in industries with labor shortages including healthcare business services and education. About a third are married and more than a third have at least one child at home. Nearly 1.1 million U.S. citizens live in households with a DACA recipient. Unfortunately DACA s eligibility requirements have not been updated since the policy was announced. DACA applicants must have been in the U.S. since 2007 meaning individuals who could qualify today could be no younger than 16. And even if applicants can meet these requirements the legal challenges have prevented the government from processing new applications. All told about 2 million Dreamers currently living in the U.S. are not protected by DACA. This includes as many as 400000 individuals who would be eligible to receive DACA status but cannot have their application processed because of Judge Hanen s injunction according to FWD.us estimates. In fact nearly all undocumented high school students graduating this year and in the years to come will be ineligible for DACA. DACA has kept families together and helped young people build their lives and careers in the country they have known as home. The future of this transformative policy and the futures of the thousands of people people who have been protected by it for more than a decade could be decided by the Supreme Court within the next two years. While Congress must ultimately act to create a pathway to permanent status for all Dreamers there are actions the Biden administration can and must do now to begin implementing a comprehensive Dreamer Protection Plan before it s too late.
