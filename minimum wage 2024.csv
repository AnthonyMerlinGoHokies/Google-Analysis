https://www.employerpass.com/state-minimum-wage-requirements-chart, Most states throughout the United States 31 in fact including Washington D.C. have created and continue to create laws to update minimum wage requirements. These state minimum wage laws go above and beyond the federal minimum wage required by the Fair Labor Standards Act FLSA.  The federal minimum wage and FLSA require that the vast majority of employees regardless of state with few exceptions make a minimum of wage 7.25 per hour. If a state has no minimum wage requirement or law or the minimum wage required by the state is lower than the federal minimum wage then the federal minimum wage typically always applies for that state. Otherwise the higher state minimum wage requirement applies.  Each time the minimum wage requirements change employers are required to raise standard pay rates for employees to the new minimum wage and begin compensating employees by the effective date of change. This pay increase should be reflected in the employees pay stub on the next scheduled pay date. Employers must also display new labor law posters as a notice to employees in the workplace when laws like minimum wage change.

https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Fast-Food-Minimum-Wage-FAQ.htm, Official website of the State of California The FAQs provide general information and are not exhaustive. They do not constitute legal advice regarding your particular circumstances.  AB 1228 is a new law in California which added sections 1474 1475 and 1476 to the Labor Code and does two main things. First it increases the minimum wage for fast food restaurant employees. Second it establishes a Fast Food Council which is empowered both to make future increases to the minimum wage and to adopt other minimum employment standards for fast food restaurants.  Minimum Wage Increase Starting April 1 2024 all fast food restaurant employees who are covered by the new law must be paid at least 20.00 per hour. Yes. A supplement to the minimum wage order must be posted by employers covered by the fast food minimum wage. The Supplement to the minimum wage order is available here. Wage Order 5 and Wage Order 7 were also updated in March 2024 as a result of AB 1228.  No. AB 1228 did not authorize additional credits to the minimum wage. A fast food employer may only credit the amounts allowed by the statewide minimum wage. No a city or county cannot pass an ordinance setting a higher minimum wage only for fast food restaurant employees covered by this law. However a city or county can set a higher general minimum wage for all employees that would apply to employees covered by this law. For example a local government minimum wage law could require all employees in the city be paid more than the current fast food employees minimum wage. The fast food restaurant establishment then must pay the higher local minimum wage. A local government can also set a higher minimum wage that is specific to a particular group of employees so long as it does not include fast food employees. Visit Minimum Wage Frequently Asked Questions ca.gov Who is Covered by the Current Law  The law applies only to employees of fast food restaurants. To be considered a fast food restaurant the restaurant must meet ALL of the below criteria However some fast food restaurants are exempt from the law. See Question 11. AB 1228 applies to employers of fast food restaurant employees regardless of whether the employer is the business entity that owns the national brand or a franchisee or licensee of that national brand. Typically customers at a fast food restaurant will eat at a table inside or outside the restaurant in their car or as soon as they get back home or to work with their order. Food sold to be baked cooked or heated at home is not for immediate consumption. Possibly. The restaurant establishment may be covered by the new law if the restaurant establishment is primarily engaged in meaning it earns more than 50 of its gross income from selling food or beverage items that are for immediate consumption. For example if a fast food pizza restaurant earns 30 of its revenue from take and bake pizza to be baked at home but earns 70 of its revenue from sales of fullycooked food and beverages for immediate consumption the restaurant is primarily engaged in selling food and beverage for immediate consumption and would be covered by the new law provided no other exemption applies. Yes the definition of fast food restaurant see Question 6 does not depend on what type of food or beverage an establishment sells. Yes. The following restaurant establishments are not covered by the new law  Bread is defined as a single unit item that weighs at least pound after cooling and must be sold as a standalone item.  The following types of fast food restaurants do not come under the exemption This exemption applies only to restaurant establishments that produced and sold bread as standalone menu items as of September 15 2023 and have continued to do so. This exemption does not require that the restaurant be primarily engaged in the sale of bread as a standalone item. The exemption may apply even when the sale of bread as a standalone menu item constitutes a small portion of the restaurant s total food sales.  A fast food restaurant establishment is exempt from the new law if it meets both of the following  1The restaurant establishment is located and operates within a grocery establishment. The term grocery establishment is defined as a retail store in the state that is  Primarily means that the establishment earns more than 50 of its gross income from the sale of household foodstuffs for offsite consumption. 2The grocery establishment employer employs the individuals working in the restaurant.  Most likely. Your employer does not fall within the grocery establishment exemption so if no other exemption applies you would be covered by the fast food minimum wage law for the work hours you perform the hours you work in the fast food restaurant.  Yes. Even though an employer may have to pay 20.00 an hour to workers at some of its establishments workers at the employer s other establishments may be exempt from the law. For example if the establishment where you work produces and sells bread as a standalone menu item your work establishment would be exempt under the bakery exemption. The establishment where your friend works may be selling the same items and be a part of the same restaurant chain but may not produce bread on site. Under this scenario your friend s establishment would be covered by the new law and the employees at your establishment would be exempt under the bakery exemption. You are still entitled to the generally applicable minimum wage. Minimum Wage Frequently Asked Questions ca.gov Under California law to qualify as an exempt employee for wage and hour purposes you must receive a salary of at least two times the state minimum wage for someone working 40 hours a week and meet other specific requirements. If your salary is less than 83200 as a fast food restaurant employee starting on April 1 2024 you are not an exempt employee. For a manager to qualify as an exempt employee under California law the employer must pay them at least two times the state minimum wage for someone working 40 hours a week and the manager must meet other specific requirements including the requirement that the manager must be engaged in exempt tasks for more than 50 of their worktime. If your employee is managing both fastfood restaurant workers and nonfast food restaurant workers then two different statewide minimum wages would apply to determine the salary threshold for exemptionthe fast food restaurant minimum wage for time overseeing the fast food restaurant work and the general statewide minimum wage for the time overseeing workers not assigned to fast food restaurant work. An employer would have to calculate the blended rate on a weekly basis based on the percentage of time spent on those tasks.  For example a manager who in the course of a workweek in April 2024 spends forty percent 40 of their time overseeing the store s fast food restaurant workers and sixty percent 60 of their time managing the store s other workers would have to be paid 1408 to meet the minimum salary requirement for exempt status that week. The math capturing this blending of rates follows  For time spent managing fastfood operations 20hour x 2 x 40 hour fulltime workweek 1600 weekly salary x 40 640 For time spent managing store s other operations 16hour x 2 x 40 hour fulltime workweek 1280 weekly salary x 60 768 Blended rate 640 plus 768 1408 salary for that week. No. An employer may not use an employees tips as a credit toward its obligation to pay the minimum wage per hour. An employee who has not been paid the minimum wage can bring a legal claim to recover wages due and possibly related damages and penalties. Your employer will carry the burden of showing they are not covered by the new law.  Generally speaking there are three ways to present such a claim through the Labor Commissioner through an alternative dispute resolution system such as arbitration if required or allowed under an employment agreement or through a lawsuit in court. Employees pursuing the first option can file an individual wage claim with the Labor Commissioners Wage Claim Adjudication Unit or they can file a Report of Labor Law Violation with the Labor Commissioners Bureau of Field Enforcement which does not pursue individual claims but may investigate and cite the employer. More information about wage claims and employee rights in general is available on the Labor Commissioner s website or from any of the Labor Commissioners local offices. Yes. When calculating the wages exempt from garnishment for a fast food restaurant employee the party seeking to garnish the wages must use the applicable statewide fast food restaurant minimum hourly wage unless a higher local minimum hourly wage exists.  Role of the Fast Food Council in Addition to the Minimum Wage AB 1228 created the Fast Food Council. The Fast Food Council is composed of appointed representatives from the fast food restaurant industry fast food restaurant franchisees or restaurant owners fast food restaurant employees advocates for fast food restaurant employees and one unaffiliated member of the public. The Council also has two nonvoting members one from the Department of Industrial Relations and one from the Governor s Office of Business and Economic Development. The Council will meet regularly to develop new minimum employment standards specific to the fast food industry. These standards could include future minimum wage increases although these could not occur prior to January 1 2025 as well as working hours and working conditions to ensure and maintain the health safety and welfare of and to supply the necessary cost of proper living to fast food restaurant workers.  The hourly minimum wage established by the Council can increase every year by either 3.5 or the increase in the consumer price index whichever is smaller. The Fast Food Council can establish a single statewide minimum wage for fast food restaurant employees or vary the minimum wage by region of the State. The Council s meetings will be open to the public and the Council will take public comment on all action items.

https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_minimumwage.htm, Official website of the State of California Effective January 1 2024 the minimum wage is 16.00 per hour for all employers. Some cities and counties have higher minimum wages than the state s rate. There is a list of City and County minimum wages in California maintained by UC Berkeley.  Please look here What amount are Sheepherders owed as a result of AB 1066 s Overtime PhaseIn? ca.gov  For REQUIRED MINIMUM MONTHLY COMPENSATION INCLUDING REQUIRED OVERTIME PAY FOR SHEEPHERDERS AND GOAT HERDERS WORKING REGULARLY SCHEDULED 24 HOUR SHIFTS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK Starting in 2017 California started a phasein schedule to reach the 15 minimum wage for all employers. Read more about the 15 phasein. How are increases to the state minimum wage be determined after the minimum wage reached 15 an hour? After the state minimum wage reached 15 an hour the rate is adjusted annually for inflation based on the national consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers CPIW. However the minimum wage cannot be lowered even if there is a negative CPI and the highest raise allowed in any one year is 3.5 percent. Also the Governor is no longer able to pause a scheduled increase and the first adjusted increases may be accelerated if the adjusted CPIW exceeded seven percent in that first year. What is the difference between the local state and federal minimum wage?  Most employers in California are subject to both the federal and state minimum wage laws. Also local entities cities and counties are allowed to enact minimum wage rates and several cities have recently adopted ordinances which establish a higher minimum wage rate for employees working within their local jurisdiction. See the list of City and County minimum wages in California maintained by UC Berkeley. The effect of this multiple coverage by different government sources is that when there are conflicting requirements in the laws the employer must follow the stricter standard that is the one that is the most beneficial to the employee. Thus since Californias current law requires a higher minimum wage rate than does the federal law all employers in California who are subject to both laws must pay the state minimum wage rate unless their employees are exempt under California law. Similarly if a local entity city or county has adopted a higher minimum wage employees must be paid the local wage where it is higher than the state or federal minimum wage rates. What are some exceptions to paying at least the minimum wage per hour? There are some employees who are exempt from the minimum wage law such as outside salespersons individuals who are the parent spouse or child of the employer and apprentices regularly indentured under the State Division of Apprenticeship Standards.  Minimum Wage Order MW2024 There is an exception for learners regardless of age who may be paid not less than 85 percent of the minimum wage rounded to the nearest nickel during their first 160 hours of employment in occupations in which they have no previous similar or related experience.  There are also exceptions for employees who are mentally or physically disabled or both and for nonprofit organizations such as sheltered workshops or rehabilitation facilities that employ disabled workers. Such individuals with licenses may have their licenses renewed and organizations may be issued a special license by the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement authorizing employment at a wage less than the legal minimum wage but only until January 1 2025. Labor Code Sections 1191 and 1191.5  May an employee agree to work for less than the minimum wage? No. The minimum wage is an obligation of the employer and cannot be waived by any agreement including collective bargaining agreements. Any remedial legislation written for the protection of employees may not be violated by agreement between the employer and employee. Civil Code Sections 1668 and 3513 Is the minimum wage the same for both adult and minor employees? Yes. There is no distinction made between adults and minors when it comes to payment of the minimum wage. Does an employer have to pay the minimum wage if they only have one employee? Yes. Unless another exemption applies as detailed in question 4 employers must pay all employees at least the minimum wage per hour.  If a worker also gets paid tips can an employer use the tips as a credit toward the obligation to pay the minimum wage? No. An employer may not use an employees tips as a credit toward its obligation to pay the minimum wage per hour.  What can a worker do if their employer does not pay at least the minimum wage? An employee who has not been paid the minimum wage can bring a legal claim to recover wages due and possibly related damages and penalties. Generally speaking there are three ways to present such a claim through the Labor Commissioner through an alternative dispute resolution system such as arbitration if required or allowed under an employment agreement or through a lawsuit in court. Employees pursuing the first option can file an individual wage claim with the Labor Commissioners Wage Claim Adjudication Unit or they can file a Report of Labor Law Violation with the Labor Commissioners Bureau of Field Enforcement which does not pursue individual claims but may investigate and cite the employer. More information about wage claims and employee rights in general is available on the Labor Commissioners website or any of the Labor Commissioners local offices.  What is the procedure that is followed after a wage claim is filed? After a wage claim is completed and filed with a local office of the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement DLSE it will be assigned to a Deputy Labor Commissioner who will determine based upon the circumstances of the claim and information presented how best to proceed. Initial action taken regarding the claim can be referral to a conference or hearing or dismissal of the claim.  If the decision is to hold a conference the parties will be notified by mail of the date time and place of the conference. The purpose of the conference is to determine the validity of the claim and to see if the claim can be resolved without a hearing. If the claim is not resolved at the conference the next step usually is to refer the matter to a hearing or dismiss it for lack of evidence.  At the hearing the parties and witnesses testify under oath and the proceeding is recorded. After the hearing an Order Decision or Award ODA of the Labor Commissioner will be served on the parties.  Either party may appeal the ODA to a civil court of competent jurisdiction. The court will set the matter for trial with each party having the opportunity to present evidence and witnesses. The evidence and testimony presented at the Labor Commissioners hearing will not be the basis for the courts decision. In the case of an appeal by the employer DLSE may represent an employee who is financially unable to afford counsel in the court proceeding.  Read more about how to file a wage claim. When the Order Decision or Award ODA is in the employees favor and there is no appeal and the employer does not pay the ODA the Division of Labor Standards Enforcement Labor Commissioner s Office will have the court enter the ODA as a judgment against the employer. This judgment has the same force and effect as any other money judgment entered by the court. Consequently workers may either try to collect the judgment themself or it can be assigned the Labor Commissioner s Office. Read more about the Judgment Enforcement Unit.  If an employer discriminates or retaliates against a worker in any manner whatsoever for example fires the worker because they asked why they were not being paid the minimum wage or because they filed a claim or threaten to file a claim with the Labor Commissioner the worker may have rights to protection from retaliation. Learn about filing a discriminationretaliation complaint with the Labor Commissioners Office. Alternatively workers can file a lawsuit in court against their employer.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/minimum-wage-increase-2024-states/,  By Aimee Picchi   Updated on December 19 2023 251 PM EST MoneyWatch  The increases will boost the baseline pay to at least 16 an hour in three states California New York and Washington. In 22 states the new minimum wages will take effect on January 1. However Nevada and Oregons new rates will go into effect on July 1 while Floridas will increase on September 30. By contrast workers in 20 states will still be subject to the federal minimum wage which has stood at 7.25 an hour since 2009 when it was last increased. Raising the minimum wage could benefit lowwage workers at a time when many continue to struggle with higher costs due to inflation even as it cools rapidly after hitting a 40year high in 2022. Although price hikes are easing the cost of groceries rent and other goods and services remains higher than prior to the pandemic.  About 1 in 4 U.S. workers earned less than 15 an hour in 2021 according to the Center for American Progress a liberal think tank. People of color and women are overrepresented among those lowwage workers it added.  Increasing the minimum wage is both good for workers and the overall economy said Holly Sklar CEO of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage a group that advocates for higher baseline wages.  Lowwage workers who get pay hikes boost the consumer spending that businesses depend on she said in a statement. While the federal minimum wage falls further and further behind the cost of living at just 7.25 an hour state increases are vital for workers businesses and communities. The latest increases puts more distance between states that are lifting their minimum wages and those that continue to rely on the federal baseline pay of 7.25 an hour.  In fact workers in six states California Connecticut Maryland New Jersey New York and Washington will be guaranteed baseline pay thats more than twice that of the federal minimum wage.  Some cities next year will also boost their minimum wage above the statewide level. Denver for instance will increase the citys minimum wage to 18.29 an hour on January 1 topping Colorados rate of 14.42 an hour.  The 20 states where the baseline wage will remain at 7.25 an hour are primarily located in the South and Midwest ranging from Alabama to Wisconsin.  Here are the states that are boosting their minimum wages in 2024 along with the new baseline pay that will take effect next year. Most of the states will increase their baseline wage beginning in January with increases in Florida Nevada and Oregon going into effect later in 2024.

https://www.dir.ca.gov/DIRNews/2023/2023-66.html, Official website of the State of California Oakland California s minimum wage will increase to 16 per hour for all employers on January 1 2024. Some cities and counties in California have a local minimum wage that is higher than the state rate.  State law requires that most California workers be paid the minimum wage. Workers paid less than the minimum wage are urged to contact the Labor Commissioner s Office in their area to file a wage claim.  The change in the minimum wage also affects the minimum salary an employee must earn to meet one part of the overtime exemption test. Exempt employees are not subject to the payment of overtime for hours worked. An employee must earn no less than two times the state s minimum wage for fulltime work to meet this initial requirement of the exemption test. As of January 1 2024 employees in California must earn an annual salary of no less than 66560 to meet this threshold requirement. In 2023 the minimum wage is 15.50 for all employees regardless of employer size.  One of the protections of the minimum wage law is an annual review of the wage rate using the U.S. Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers U.S. CPIW. The Department of Finance calculated that the U.S. CPIW increased by 6.16 percent for the period from July 1 2022 to June 30 2023 compared to the prior 12month period. The minimum wage increases each year by the lesser of 3.5 percent and the rate of change in the averages of the two most recent U.S. CPIW unless those averages are negative. If the averages are negative there is no change in the minimum wage for the following year. On July 31 2023 Governor Newsom certified the minimum wage increase for all employers for 2024.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/01/04/state-minimum-wage-increases/, The increases will bump wages for about 9.9 million workers according to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute EPI a Washingtonbased think tank. The EPI s analysis found that women make up a majority of those receiving a wage increase and that Black and Hispanic workers would disproportionately benefit from the pay raises. But raising the minimum wage directly affects a small part of the overall U.S. labor force about 6 percent. Because of the competitive job market in recent years many workers are already being paid higher wages because employers boosted pay and benefits. The average hourly wage in the country was 34.10 in November according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS an increase of 4 percent over the past 12 months. Even workers in the lowerpaid retail industry have seen steadily increasing wages. The average retail wage was 23.86 per hour in November according to BLS data. Still raising the minimum wage can help lock in some of those recent gains for workers across industries said EPI senior economist Elise Gould.  It creates a floor that wages can t fall below even if the economy gets weaker in the future she said. Bluecollar workers won big in 2023 defying bleak predictions Raising the minimum wage tends to be extremely popular with voters both Democrats and Republicans. But many business groups and Republican lawmakers have opposed increases saying it could force companies to cut jobs because they might not be able to absorb the higher costs. The Congressional Budget Office last month released an analysis estimating that raising the federal minimum wage to 17 an hour by 2029 would reduce poverty but also lead to the elimination of hundreds of thousands of jobs. Although fewer people may directly gain from the 2024 minimumwage increases boosting the wage floors can benefit some of the country s most vulnerable workers especially as people grapple with costofliving increases that remain high. Inflation hit a high of 9.1 percent in 2022 but dropped to 3.1 percent in November still higher than normal. A dozen states that boosted minimum wage this year have tied automatic annual increases to inflation according to EPI including Alaska Montana and Vermont. Though many states saw a bump about 20 states still use the federal minimum wage of 7.25 per hour. Maryland was one of the 22 states to increase its minimum wage this year bumping it to 15 per hour. The change will benefit about 163000 workers according to the governor s office. Wages in Virginia and D.C. remain unchanged this year at 12 and 17 respectively far above the federal minimum wage of 7.25 which is used in about 20 states. D.C is also set to increase the minimum wage later this year bumping it to 17.50 in July. Washington state s January increase brings it to 16.28 per hour the highest state minimum wage in the country. Many individual municipalities beat it out across the country including Tukwila Wash. which now has the highest minimum wage in the country according to EPI. Workers at large employers in the city just south of Seattle will now make at least 20.29 per hour. Thirty years of strikes In recent years many workers emboldened by the tight labor market and fed up with low wages have advocated for increased pay and benefits sometimes banding together and forming unions and even striking. State minimum wages may vary based on employer size healthcare availability and tipped wages. Some states do not have a minimum wage or they have a minimum wage lower than the federal minimum. Those states minimum wages default to the federal minimum.
