Trump is now the GOP s presumptive presidential nominee. Looking ahead to Trump s rematch with President Joe Biden in November some analysts believe that Trump s electoral base is expanding to include more Black Hispanic and Asian voters. Undoubtedly so. But the evidence that Democrats are hemorrhaging minority support and are on the losing side of an impending racial realignment is less clear than Trump supporters hope and than Biden supporters fear. Likewise seven months out from Election Day Biden s postState of the Union surge in the polls is neither important nor insignificant. Nobody however can doubt that white workingclass voters defined simply as white voters without a college degree are a key to Trump s past present and pending electoral fortunes. I certainly don t for reasons both analytical parsing relevant polling and election data and anecdotal knowing white workingclass relatives and friends who used to be Reagan Democrats became exurban Republicans and are now MAGA Republicans . But three facts about Trump s support among white workingclass voters are not generally recognized or understood. First several other Republican presidential standardbearers as well as many GOP candidates for Congress won about the same share or an even greater share of white workingclass votes than Trump did in 2016 and 2020. And in 2022 MakeAmericaGreatAgain MAGAidentified Republicans in many states did less well than Republicans who distanced themselves from Trump. Second Will Marble a brilliant Penn data scientist has documented that since 2000 educational polarization between whites with a college degree and whites without one has widened on both economic and cultural issues and pushed ever more noncollege whites toward the Republican Party.  But might that polarization be more pronounced for workingclass white evangelicals than it is for other whites without a college degree? That is what seems to be suggested by exit polls showing that in both 2016 and 2020 Trump won white workingclass evangelicals but lost other white workingclass voters. Third white evangelical workingclass voters and other white workingclass voters differ with respect to their positions on many policy issues and might also differ in relation to the types of campaignmessaging that do the most to mobilize and motivate them to vote for or against a given candidate or party. In the March 2021 edition of Perspectives on Politics political scientists Nicholas Carnes and Noam Lupu painstakingly analyzed survey and voting data on how the white workingclass voted in 2016. They found no evidence that Trump himself uniquely mobilized the white working class.  As I explained in American Purpose1 in 2016 and again in 2020 Trump s support among white workingclass voters was not unprecedented. Take a look at Figure 1 below. It is adapted from Carnes and Lupu s summary of their study for The Washington Post. In 2022 Trumptouted MAGAmessaged GOP candidates like Ohio s J.D. Vance and Georgia s Herschel Walker fared less well with workingclass white voters than Republican candidates in their respective states who distanced themselves from Trump like Ohio s Mike DeWine and Georgia s Brian Kemp. In the 2022 midterms workingclass whites broke 66 for Republicans versus 32 for Democrats 66 besting the highest share of that vote received by Trump 62 in 2016 and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis was reelected with 70 of the state s white workingclass vote. When it comes to presidential primaries and general elections it is useful to understand the white vote as comprised of at least four subelectorates white evangelicals with college degrees white evangelicals without college degrees white Catholics and other nonevangelical whites with college degrees and white Catholics and other nonevangelical whites without college degrees. According to New York Times election polls in 2020 67 of those who cast a ballot for president were white and about 28 of those who cast a ballot for president in 2020 were white evangelical Christians. So about 42 of the total white votecasting electorate in 2020 consisted of white evangelicals. White voters without a college degree were about 35 of all 2020 voters and about 52 of all white voters. Judging by American National Election Studies data and Public Religion Research Institute data about 45 of white 2020 voters without a college degree were white evangelicals while about 55 were nonevangelical whites. So we can estimate that about 16 of the total votecasting 2020 electorate 45 of 35 consisted of white evangelicals with no college degree while about 19 55 of 35 of it was comprised of nonevangelical workingclass whites. In 2020 based on NBC News polls2 84 of workingclass white evangelicals who voted cast a ballot for Trump. That was four points better than the 80 majority among workingclass white evangelical voters that Trump received in 2016. But what about the nonevangelical white workingclass? What about the predominantly urban and suburban bluecollar white Catholics and nonevangelical Protestant whites without college degrees who most people still call to mind when they hear white working class ? Take a look at Table 1 and Table 2. In 2016 nonevangelical white workingclass voters supported Hillary Rodham Clinton over Trump by 22 points 58 to 36. In 2020 they voted for Biden over Trump by 15 points 56 to 41. The gap between the two white workingclass votes for Trump was 44 points in 2016 80 versus 36 and 43 points in 2020 84 to 41. Glance back at Figure 1. It shows that Trump s 2020 share of the white workingclass vote was 59. Now look again at Table 2. It would appear that Trump got to that solid 2020 white workingclass majority by winning 84 of the white evangelical workingclass voters who were 45 of the total white 2020 votecasting electorate and 16 of the total 2020 votecasting electorate plus 41 of the nonevangelical white workingclass voters who were 55 of the total white noncollege 2020 votecasting electorate and 19 of the total 2020 votecasting electorate. White evangelicals are a larger share of Republican primary voters than they are of general election voters. For example in this year s GOP South Carolina presidential primary white evangelicals were 61 of the state s votecasting electorate. Trump won big in South Carolina by beating the state s exGovernor Nikki Haley 71 to 29 among white evangelicals. But among all other South Carolina GOP primary voters Haley beat Trump 55 to 44. In these states Trump received 89 of the votes cast by white evangelicals without college degrees versus 76 of the votes cast by all other white workingclass voters a 13point gap. In July 2016 New York s Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer made this prediction For every bluecollar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.  As it turned out Clinton didn t win that many more moderate Republican votes but she also did not lose the bluecollar nonevangelical white workingclass vote and neither did Biden in 2020. I am not at all sure what explains why nonevangelical workingclass whites did not give Trump a majority of their votes in 2020. Nor do I know why Trump s share of the votes cast by collegeeducated white evangelicals fell from 81 in 2016 to 63 in 2020 or why he got only 71 of their vote in this year s early GOP primaries. And I have no real handle on what if anything either group s voting in 2016 and 2020 portends for this year s election. But permit me to offer a conjecture or two prefaced by a conceptual riff that only an old political science professor could love. Some three decades ago in the opening chapter of a Congressional Quarterly volume parsing the 1992 elections Donald E. Stokes a founding father of American national election studies and I explained that there are two kinds of issues that matter in presidential elections position issues and valence issues. A position issue is one on which the rival parties or candidates reach out for the support of the electorate by taking different positions on a policy question that divides the electorate like tariffs high or low or no or abortion prolife or prochoice or fracking yay or nay. But there are also issues on which voters distinguish parties and candidates not by their real or perceived differences on policy questions but on the degree to which they are linked in voters minds with conditions goals or symbols that are almost universally approved or disapproved by the electorate strong versus weak integrity versus corruption mean versus kind cares about average people versus uncaringselfish and so on. Over the last decade Trump s populist brews of position issues and valence issues won him two and soon to be three straight Republican presidential nominations plus one presidential election. Patrick Ruffini a veteran GOP pollster in effect chronicles Trump s appeals in his fine new book Party of the People Inside the Multiracial Populist Coalition Remaking the GOP.  For example as Ruffini discusses in 2016 prochoice Trump suddenly flipped to a prolife position. Since then Trump has said and done just about everything and anything one could to win over white evangelical voters while simultaneously activating underlying conservative tendencies in nonwhite former Democrats. How? By shifting the emphasis toward nationalism so as to win the substantial number of Republicans who are culturally conservative but neither evangelical nor regularly churchgoing  Trump built a stronger more internally cohesive right than the old coalition of economic conservatives social conservatives and national security conservatives Hiding behind Trump s abrasive rhetoric was a rawer form of culture war politics more popular with primary voters and as it turns out with general election voters than the strictures of movement conservatism.3 To his credit Ruffini recognizes that there are still large numbers of voters in flux. The book s last section is appropriately headed A Nation Up for Grabs. It is indeed and in ways that could challenge Trump to square certain electoral circles that it just might not be possible to square. For instance mindful that the postDobbs surge in prochoice voting hurt Republicans in 2022 Trump is now recalibrating his 2016 flip to a prolife position. And he is trying to boost his appeal to racial minority voters who as demonstrated in a forthcoming Journal of Politics article coauthored by the aforementioned Penn data scientist Will Marble actually did not trend to Trump through 2020. In 2016 Clinton lost the overall white Catholic vote by 33 points in 2020 Biden lost it too but only by 15 points. As much as any single shift in voting patterns between those two elections the shift in the white Catholic vote away from Trump cost him the 2020 election. In 2024 if Biden loses the white Catholic vote by much more than 15 points and if he also loses the nonevangelical white workingclass vote it would take a miracle for him to win hypercompetitive swing states like Pennsylvania. When all the 2024 presidential votes are counted my guess and a guess is all that I can offer is that Biden will keep his defeat among white Catholics to within 20 points and that Trump s support among nonevangelical workingclass whites the white Catholic plumbers will have ticked up a few points over its 2020 level but still give Biden an absolute majority. What about collegeeducated white evangelicals the bornagain professors ? In a Pew survey only 15 of all white evangelicals agreed that morally upstanding describes Trump well while 37 agreed that it describes him not toonot at all well. The survey did not break down the two groups by education status but I d guess that collegeeducated white evangelicals are significantly more likely than their workingclass coreligionists to disfavor Trump. But disfavor him how much more and how strongly? From 2016 to 2020 Trump s collegeeducated white evangelical vote fell 18 points from 81 to 63 for a 22 dip. Were 2024 to witness another dip that size or greater he would not win a majority of that vote. I sincerely doubt that will happen but even another 5 slide from 63 would put him below 60. That s not inconceivable. In presidential elections campaigns matter only marginally to whether and how people vote and who ultimately wins but especially in a highly competitive contest that is decided by in whose direction a few key swing states swing what positions candidates or parties take on given issues and what kinds of valence appeals they make can not only matter but prove decisive. There is at least one proBiden Faith Forward campaign video now making the rounds that to me at least seems almost calculated in both position issue and valence issue terms to exploit the possible weaknesses and cracks in Trump s populist coalitionbuilding project and in particular to scramble his white evangelical base. In any case if I were trying to get Trump back in office I would keep both campaign eyes on collegeeducated white evangelicals especially in swing states and not count on the multiracial coalition realignment materializing in time to make a decisive difference in November. And if I were trying to get Biden reelected I would read Ruffini s book do more to activate voter empathies for Biden than to stir voter antipathies toward Trump and concede not a single nonevangelical white workingclass vote until all the votes for president are once again duly counted.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/03/30/biden-trump-race/, Black voters are poised once again to play a critical role in the presidential election. President Biden needs every vote possible among these voters to secure a second term. He needs to keep his margin over Trump among Black voters at or near where it has been for Democrats in most past elections. He also needs strong turnout at a time when Black participation has declined. Trump meanwhile has prioritized growing his share of support among Black voters and his advisers argue that inflation and immigration are two issues that could help him do so. They see Black men and particularly younger Black men as their best opportunities for adding support. Assessments of the 2020 results vary slightly. Exit polls estimated that Trump won 12 percent of the Black vote whereas the Pew Research Center s analysis estimated that the former president won 8 percent of the Black vote. Neither those studies nor other analyses have shown any notable rise in Republican support from Black Americans in presidential and midterm elections since 2016. Four recent polls Quinnipiac EconomistYouGov New York TimesSiena and Marquette University Law School however have shown Trump with at least 20 percent support among Black adults. Now a new Fox News survey shows him with the support of 26 percent of Black voters. If accurate and if the numbers held until November Trump would receive the highest share of the Black vote for any Republican presidential candidate since Richard M. Nixon in 1960. Before the civil rights movement in the 1960s Republican presidential candidates routinely captured a significant minority of the Black vote. Since the 60s Republicans have seen their share drop substantially. The low point for Republicans came during Barack Obama s two campaigns for president in 2008 and 2012 when their share dropped to about 5 percent. Pollsters consider the Obama elections atypical however given his unique and historic appeal to Black voters as the nation s first Black president. For that reason they say it would not be overly surprising for Trump again to win roughly 11 to 13 percent of the Black vote. They are highly skeptical however of the current polls showing support of 20 percent or more. Christopher Towler a political scientist at California State University at Sacramento who oversees the Black Voter Project said he is dubious that there is suddenly a magical shift in Trump s direction compared with 2016 and 2020. I don t see it happening he said. He said the biggest concern about the recent polls is that the sample sizes for Black voters are frequently tiny often no more than 100 or so and thus they have a big margin of error. Political scientists and political strategists alike agree that samples of that size are less likely to be fully representative of the Black community and say that largescale surveys of Black Americans of which there are few are more reliable. Cornell Belcher who was one of Obama s pollsters said the likelihood of Trump receiving a significantly higher percentage of the Black vote than any Republican since 1960 is absurd. He added I ve been doing largesamplesize polls of Black voters for four years and never in those four years has Donald Trump ever moved above 10 percent.  Belcher said his disbelief is grounded not only in voting patterns among Black adults over a series of elections but also in Trump s history. He cited the former president s racist comments and his positions on issues at odds with attitudes of Black Americans.  It doesn t make sense that someone who is on the wrong side of every issue that is a top issue of concern for African Americans is going to also garner more support from African Americans than say George W. Bush who actually did some outreach and tried to move the Republican Party to be more open and inclusive Belcher said. Political scientist Alan Abramowitz of Emory University did an analysis of the recent polls that was posted on the website of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. He too cast doubt on the findings about Trump. Acknowledging that it s possible there is a shortterm swing in Trump s direction he said history alone would suggest that the former president s support among Black voters will fade from current levels by November. I don t think it s real he said. These surveys however have spawned a series of news stories pointing to a lack of enthusiasm for Biden among Black voters especially younger Black Americans. Biden s approval rating among Black Americans has declined over time as it has among Americans overall. In January 2022 the Pew Center found that 60 percent of Black adults approved of the way he was doing his job. In January of this year his approval stood at 48 percent. But Biden s favorable ratings among Black adults a measure less related to job performance have softened only slightly. Between July 2022 and this February his favorability moved from 65 percent positive to 61 percent positive according to Pew. In contrast the president s favorable rating among Hispanic adults dropped 17 points over the same time period. Trump s advisers believe gains among Black voters are quite possible and claim they will work for those votes. They acknowledge that there are few Black political surrogates who can make the case for the former president other than Sen. Tim Scott RS.C. who also ran for president but enthusiastically endorsed Trump and is a potential vicepresidential pick but say there are others in the Black community outside of politics who could act as validators.  President Trump has made increasing his vote share amongst the Black and Hispanic community a top priority Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said in a message. He said the contrast between families struggling with higher costs and the accommodations for migrants who have ended up in big cities is something the campaign will continue to take advantage of.  Biden s advisers don t dispute that they have work to do to boost Biden s standing among Black voters but they express confidence that they will get the job done. Jasmine Harris director of Black media for the BidenHarris campaign pointed to administration accomplishments that have been important to Black voters including record low Black unemployment and historic funding for historically Black colleges and universities.  Come November Black voters will once again show up for Joe Biden and not Donald Trump who has consistently worked to demean and degrade Black Americans Harris said in an email message. Biden allies appear to worry less about a big shift to Trump among Black voters than about the overall level of Black turnout in November. For example Black turnout in 2022 dropped by 10 percentage points when compared with the 2018 midterm election. Towler said Black Americans who are infrequent voters will present a real challenge for Biden. They really can t find anything to get excited about he said. They re still really against Trump but not excited in a way that will really get them out there to vote. They say Trump is a danger he s a racist but we re not sure we re going to get out and vote for Biden. That s the big danger.  Turnout in Black precincts in Philadelphia Detroit and Milwaukee will be critical to Biden s hopes of winning Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin respectively. If he were to hold those three states while losing Georgia Nevada and Arizona the three other main battlegrounds he would still win an electoral college majority. Turnout in Philadelphia has declined in three consecutive elections. The drop has been most evident in heavily Hispanic precincts but also notable in Black precincts. Democratic strategists fear this could put the state at risk in November. The loss of Pennsylvania alone with its 19 electoral college votes could be crippling to Biden s chances given challenges he could face this year in Georgia and Arizona. In Wisconsin an analysis by the Marquette University Law School found that turnout in Milwaukee s heavily Black wards dropped relative to the rest of the city in each of the last two presidential and gubernatorial elections.  Despite legitimate skepticism about the validity of some of the current polling no one can say definitively that Trump s share of the Black vote won t increase this November certainly not in a political environment this volatile. Add to that the possibility that some Black adults who vote only infrequently will simply stay home or even cast a vote for a thirdparty candidate and it s clear why Biden s team will be intently focused on these voters.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/poll-biden-trump-tight-race-election-interest-low-rcna148170, Professional pollsters at a Democratic polling firm Hart Research Associates and a Republican firm Public Opinion Strategies have worked together to conduct and operate this poll since 1989. Coldwater Corporation served as the Republican firm from 19892004.  The polling firms employ a call center where live interviewers speak by cell phone and telephone with a cross section of usually 1000 respondents. The respondents are randomly selected from national lists of households and cell numbers. Respondents are asked for by name starting with the youngest male adult or female adult in the household.  One of the common questions that critics ask of polls is I wasn t interviewed so why should this poll matter? By interviewing 1000 respondents and applying minimal weights based on race ethnicity age gender education and the 2020 presidential vote the poll achieves a representative sample of the nation at large with a margin of error at a 95 confidence level. NBC News editors and reporters along with the pollsters at Hart Research and Public Opinion Strategies all work to formulate the questions to try to capture the news and current events NBC is trying to gauge. Both Hart Research and Public Opinion Strategies work to ensure the language and placement of the questions are as neutral as possible. The poll also shows Biden trimming Trump s previous lead to just 2 points in a headtohead contest an improvement within the margin of error compared to the previous survey as Biden bests Trump on the issues of abortion and uniting the country while Trump is ahead on competency and dealing with inflation. And it finds inflation and immigration topping the list of most important issues facing the country as just onethird of voters give Biden credit for an improving economy. But what also stands out in the survey is how the low voter interest and the independent candidacy of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. could scramble what has been a stable presidential contest with more than six months until Election Day. While Trump holds a 2point edge over Biden head to head Biden leads Trump by 2 points in a fiveway ballot test including Kennedy and other thirdparty candidates.  I don t think Biden has done much as a president. And if Trump gets elected I just feel like it s going to be the same thing as it was before Biden got elected said poll respondent Devin Fletcher 37 of Wayne Michigan a Democrat who said he s still voting for Biden.  I just don t feel like I have a candidate that I m excited to vote for Fletcher added. Another poll respondent from New Jersey who declined to provide her name and voted for Biden in 2020 said she wouldn t be voting in November.  Our candidates are horrible. I have no interest in voting for Biden. He did nothing. And I absolutely will not vote for Trump she said. Democratic pollster Jeff Horwitt of Hart Research Associates who conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff of Public Opinion Strategies said Americans don t agree on much these days but nothing unites the country more than voters desire to tune this election out.  The poll was conducted April 1216 during yet another turbulent time in American politics including the beginning of Trump s criminal trial in New York and new attacks and heightened tensions in the Middle East. According to the poll 64 of registered voters say they have high levels of interest in November s election registering either a 9 or a 10 on a 10point scale of interest. That s lower than what the NBC News poll showed at this time in the 2008 74 2012 67 2016 69 and 2020 77 presidential contests. The question dates to the 2008 election cycle. The lowest level of high election interest in the poll during a presidential cycle was in March 2012 at 59. But it quickly ticked up in the next survey. This election cycle high interest has been both low and relatively flat for months according to the poll. McInturff the Republican pollster says the high level of interest in the poll has always been a signal for the level of turnout for a presidential contest.  It makes it very hard for us to predict turnout this far in advance of November but every signal is turnout will be a lower percentage of eligible voters than in 2020 he said. By party the current poll shows 70 of selfidentified Republicans saying they have high interest in the coming election compared with 65 of Democrats who say so. Independents are at 48 while only 36 of voters ages 18 to 34 rate themselves as highly interested in the election.  They just aren t low interest McInturff said of young voters. They are offthecharts low.  The poll also finds Trump narrowly ahead of Biden by 2 points among registered voters in a headtohead matchup 46 to 44 down from Trump s 5point advantage in January 47 to 42. The movement which is within the poll s margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points is consistent with what other national polls have found in the TrumpBiden race. Trump s biggest advantages are among men 53 to 37 white voters 54 to 37 and white voters without college degrees 65 to 25. Biden s top advantages are among Black voters 71 to 13 women 50 to 39 and Latinos 49 to 39. The poll shows the two candidates are essentially tied among independents Biden 36 Trump 34 and voters ages 1834 Biden 44 Trump 43. One of the big polling mysteries this cycle is whether young voters have defected from Biden as the NBC News poll has found over multiple surveys or whether Democrats have maintained their advantage among that demographic. When the ballot is expanded to five named candidates Biden takes a 2point lead over Trump Biden 39 Trump 37 Kennedy 13 Jill Stein 3 and Cornel West 2. Again the result between Biden and Trump is within the poll s margin of error. Notably the poll finds a greater share of Trump voters from the headtohead matchup supporting Kennedy in the expanded ballot compared with Biden voters different from the results of some other surveys. Read more here about how Kennedys candidacy affects the 2024 race according to the poll. In addition the poll found 42 of registered voters approving of Biden s overall job performance up 5 points since January s NBC News poll which found Biden at the lowest point of his presidency. Fiftysix percent of voters say they disapprove of the job he has done which is down 4 points from January. Biden s gains over the past few months have come from key parts of his 2020 base especially among Democrats and Black voters. But he continues to hold low ratings among Latinos 40 approval young voters 37 and independents 36.  The data across this poll show that Joe Biden has begun to gain some ground in rebuilding his coalition from 2020 said Horwitt the Democratic pollster. The question is whether he can build upon this momentum and make inroads with the groups of voters that still are holding back support.  But McInturff the GOP pollster points out that the only recent presidents who lost reelection had approval ratings higher than Biden s at this point in the election cycle George H.W. Bush 43 and Trump 46.  President Biden has a precarious hold on the presidency and is in a difficult position as it relates to his reelection McInturff said. On the issues 39 of voters say they approve of Biden s handling of the economy up from 36 in January 28 approve of his handling of border security and immigration and just 27 approve of his handling of the IsraelHamas war down from 29 in January. Voters gave Biden his highest issue rating on addressing student loan debt with 44 approving of his handling of the issue compared with 51 who say they disapprove. The NBC News poll asked voters to determine which candidate they thought is better on several different issues and attributes. Biden holds a 15point advantage over Trump on dealing with the issue of abortion and he is ahead by 9 points on having the ability to bring the country together though that is down from his 24point advantage on that issue in the September 2020 NBC News poll. Trump meanwhile leads in having the ability to handle a crisis by 4 points in having a strong record of accomplishments by 7 points in being competent and effective by 11 points in having the necessary mental and physical health to be president by 19 points and in dealing with inflation and the cost of living by 22 points. Inflation and the cost of living top the list of issues in the poll with 23 of voters saying they re the most important issue facing the country. The other top voters is immigration and the situation at the border 22 followed by threats to democracy 16 jobs and the economy 11 abortion 6 and health care 6. In addition 63 of voters say their families incomes are falling behind the cost of living essentially unchanged from what the poll found in 2022 and 2023. And 53 of voters say the country s economy hasn t improved compared with 33 who say that it has improved and that Biden deserves some credit for it and another 8 who agree the economy has improved but don t give him credit for it.  If I look back to when I had all three of my children in the house we only have one child left in the house now and we re spending more now than what we did when we had a family of five said poll respondent Art Fales 45 of Florida who says he s most likely voting for Trump. But on a separate question is there an issue so important that you ll vote for or against a candidate solely on that basis? the top responses are protecting democracy and constitutional rights 28 immigration and border security 20 and abortion 19.
