It goes on to talk about how it ll affect many young individuals in a negative way and why it shouldn t be defunded in the first place.  In America we are taught that everyone has the same basic fundamental rights no matter race or gender. However the government is currently trying to mess with these basic rights by taking away a woman s right to choose what she does with her body by defunding Planned Parenthood. Planned Parenthood was first founded in October 16 1916 by Margaret Sanger Ethel Bryne and Fania Mindell. It was founded on the basis that women should have the information and care that they need to live strong healthy lives to fulfill their dreams. In 1973 abortion became legalized for women who wanted to end their pregnancy. Planned Parenthood clinics allow women the choice to end their pregnancy if needed. Today there are more than 600 health centers around the United States. It provides a safety net for many young women all around the country and makes women feel like they have choice on what happens with their own body. However many people want to defund planned parenthood clinics and make abortions illegal. By defunding planned parenthood clinics you take away a women s right to choose what happens to her body. Instead of giving her that choice which is a basic freedom you take away her rights which is not only unethical it is just wrong on so many levels. One out of six women are victims of sexual abuse every 98 seconds someone is sexually assaulted in America. Sadly sexual abuse is something that is not uncommon in our modern day it s always happening. In many situations sexual abuse results in the victim getting pregnant. Victims of sexaul abuse will turn to Planned Parenthood for support and guidance in their time of need. Many times those women will want to get an abortion to terminate the pregnancy. Too many individuals conservatives in particularly believe that human life begins at conception and abortion is the murder of a human being. What they don t understand is the view from the victim itself who had to go through that tragedy and is now carrying the baby of her sexual abuser. It takes a physical and mental toll on the person who was abused. The baby is just a reminder of what she went through and sometimes many women don t want to carry that around with them so they turn to Planned Parenthood for a safe abortion. Just because the woman doesn t want to keep the baby doesn t make her a horrible person she is just doing what is best for her. In many cases the sexual abuser is a family member. You re tellling me that a women who is sexual abused by a family member and gets pregnant should keep the baby? No. It is the women s choice on what she decides to do with the baby in the end and should never be placed into the hands of other people to decide what the women is allowed to do with her body.  Along with abortions Planned Parenthood provides health care to many individuals. They teach many young individuals how to have safe sex provide women with birth control teach individuals about STDs and screen for cancers. By defunding this program many people will be left without the right affordable care that they need. Cecile Richards a former president of Planned Parenthood believes that women s preventive care including birth control is basic health care. She says it shouldn t be a revolutionary idea but unfortunately it is to some. Like her and many others she believes that women s preventive care is our basic right which it is. Along with many other women I use birth control as well. It not only is used as a preventive measure for young adults who are sexually active it helps many women with their menstrual cycle. It is also our basic right to have affordable access to this care which would be taken away from hundreds of thousands of women if Planned Parenthood becomes defunded. It is a basic right that I deserve as a woman and by taking this away you take away the basic fundamental rights of women everywhere.  The fact that the government mainly Trump and the right wing wants to defund Planned Parenthood is ridiculous. They shouldn t be allowed to choose what a women can and cannot do. The government doesn t have the right to choose what happens to a woman s body. It is my body my choice. Sadly we live in a society that thinks they can make all these choices for women. Until they are in a women s shoes they will never understand what a women goes through and the difficult choices they have to make regarding preventive care and abortions.   .

https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2015/09/24/defunding-planned-parenthood-would-actually-increase-government-spending/, The Congressional Budget Office said in a new report on Thursday that cutting off the women s health organization from federal money would actually increase public spending by an estimated 130 million over 10 years. Planned Parenthood which receives about 500 million annually from the government was hurled into the spotlight this summer after an antiabortion group released several videos showing employees discussing the logistics of fetal tissue donation and reinvigorated the national debate over abortion. Recent proposals from Republicans including one that passed the House last week would halt funds for just a year. Senate Republicans proposed a similar measure Tuesday which is expected to fail in a vote on Thursday.  Planned Parenthood supporters defending the organization on the streets and with hashtags now wait to learn the fate of its primary source of funding. Eighty percent of clients receive services to prevent unintended pregnancy according to the organization s data though federal funding is not permitted to be used for abortions.  This legislation threatens millions of people s access to preventive health care Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards said Thursday in a statement. In their obsession with attacking women s access to health care extreme members of Congress would take basic health care away from people who need it most those who are struggling to get by who rely on Medicaid or have no health insurance and those who live in areas with few medical options.  The centers serve more than 40 percent of women who receive birth control from safetynet providers in 18 states according to a recent report from the Guttmacher Institute a nonprofit reproductive health organization and more than half of such women in 11 states. The CBO a nonpartisan watchdog estimates defunding Planned Parenthood which serves roughly 2.6 million women would lead to more unplanned births as patients lost access to birth control. Medicaid would cover some of those births the report asserts and some of those children would qualify for Medicaid and other welfare programs. The office s math Halting federal funds to Planned Parenthood would shrink spending by 520 million in the short run but over the first decade it would cost taxpayers an additional 650 million.  The effects of the legislation on federal spending are highly uncertain the report said and would depend largely on if and how Planned Parenthood clients sought alternative services.

The independent source for health policy research polling and news. Alina Salganicoff Laurie Sobel Ivette Gomez and Amrutha RamaswamyPublished Mar 14 2024 The overturning of Roe v. Wade has limited abortion access in large swaths of the United States but for many individuals especially those with Medicaid coverage access to abortion services was limited prior to the Dobbs decision. Starting in 1977 the Hyde Amendment has banned the use of any federal funds for abortion only allowing exceptions to pay for terminating pregnancies that endanger the life of the woman or that result from rape or incest. Since it was first enacted over 40 years ago the amendment has been sponsored and supported by legislators who oppose abortion and object to the federal government s use of taxpayer money for abortion services. The policy is not a permanent law but rather has been attached as a temporary rider to the annual Congressional appropriations bill for the Department of Health and Human Services HHS and has been renewed annually by Congress. This brief details the federal programs that are affected by the Hyde Amendment and laws and regulations that have a similar goal provides estimates on the share of women insured by Medicaid affected by the law reviews the impact of the law on their access to abortion services and discusses the potential effect if the law were to be repealed. A backlash to the Roe v. Wade ruling the Hyde Amendment initially only affected federal funding for abortions under Medicaid a state and federal health program for individuals with low incomes. Because Congress reauthorizes the Hyde Amendment annually as an attachment to the appropriations bill for HHS it also restricts federal abortion funding under the Indian Health Service Medicare and the Children s Health Insurance Program. Over the years language similar to that in the Hyde Amendment has been incorporated into a range of other federal programs that provide or pay for health services to people who could become pregnant including the military s TRICARE program federal prisons the Peace Corps and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program Appendix Table 2. The Affordable Care Act ACA includes a provision that applies the Hyde restrictions to Marketplace plans ensuring that federal funds are only used to subsidize coverage for pregnancy terminations that endanger the life of the woman or that are a result of rape or incest. Marketplace insurers can offer a plan the covers abortions beyond the federal limitations but federal funds cannot be used towards this coverage. There are also federal rules on how insurers must segregate the funds used toward the premium for abortion coverage. Because Medicaid is jointly funded by the federal and state governments states can choose to pay for abortions for Medicaid enrollees in other instances but must use their own revenues and not federal funds to cover the service. Currently abortion remains legal in 36 states and DC although states vary in their gestational limits. Of these states 17 have a policy directing the use of their own funds to pay for abortions for women with low incomes insured by Medicaid beyond the Hyde limitations nine of which provide coverage as the result of a court order Figure 1. Most recently there has been litigation challenging Pennsylvania s policy to restrict abortion coverage for Medicaid enrollees. In January 2024 the Pennsylvania Supreme Court ruled that the state constitution secures the fundamental right to reproductive autonomy which includes a right to have an abortion or carry a pregnancy to term. The lower court will review the case in light of this ruling and depending on the ruling Pennsylvania could become the 18th state to use its state funds to pay for abortion services for Medicaid enrollees. In the remaining states and the District of Columbia where abortion is not banned almost all state programs do not pay for abortions for enrollees beyond the Hyde exceptions. In a few of these states however abortion coverage is still very restricted but state programs use state funds to extend coverage to very limited situations where the pregnant person s health is at risk or there is a fetal anomaly. Federal courts have ruled that the Medicaid statute as modified by the Hyde Amendment requires states to pay for abortions that fall under the Hyde Exceptions and have blocked enforcement of state statutes that prohibit coverage for these exceptions. The federal government has stated that the Hyde Amendment requires coverage in cases of rape incest and life endangerment. In 1998 in a letter to all the state Medicaid directors explaining a change to the Hyde Amendment Health and Human Services stated that All abortions covered by the Hyde Amendment including those abortions related to rape or incest are medically necessary services and are required to be provided by states participating in the Medicaid program. However a 2022 Congressional Research Service CRS overview of the Hyde Amendment published after the Dobbs decision lists open questions such as whether payment for travel for abortion services also falls under the scope of the Hyde Amendment and conjectures that the interplay of state abortion bans and laws and the Amendment may be relitigated. Despite this clear guidance and court precedent historically the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS has not taken any enforcement action against states for failing to comply with covering abortion in all of the circumstances required by Hyde. A 2019 GAO study of state policies regarding Medicaid coverage of abortion found that South Dakota s Medicaid program only covers abortions in the case of life endangerment but no action was taken by CMS. Since the Dobbs ruling people living in many states cannot legally obtain an abortion in their state in all the Hyde circumstances including rape or incest. Fourteen states have banned abortion and although all of these bans contain exceptions to safeguard the life of the pregnant person most do not have exceptions for cases of rape or incest and therefore would not allow for the provision of those services to Medicaid enrollees in those states Alabama Arkansas Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri Oklahoma South Dakota Tennessee and Texas. Rarely some Medicaid enrollees may be able to travel out of state and have a clinic bill their home state Medicaid for an abortion in the Hyde circumstances. For example a clinic in Minnesota where abortion is legal provides abortions to North Dakota Medicaid enrollees and bills North Dakota Medicaid when the abortion qualifies for a Hyde circumstance. However most Medicaid enrollees living in states where abortion is banned will not be able to use their coverage for an abortion that qualifies as a Hyde circumstance. There are practically no abortion providers in states where abortion is banned and people who can travel out of state will most likely not be able to find a provider able to bill their home state s Medicaid program. Additionally some states have extensive reporting requirements for cases of rape and incest that may be acting in conflict with the agency s guidance. In a 1993 letter to all Medicaid directors Sally K. Richardson the director of the Medicaid Bureau at CMS wrote that stateestablished reporting requirements for rape or incest may not serve as an additional coverage requirement to deny or impede payment for abortion where pregnancies result from rape or incest. The State must establish procedures which permit the reporting requirements to be waived and the procedure reimbursed if the treating physician certified that in his or her professional opinion the patient was unable for physical or psychological reasons to comply with the reporting requirements. The 2019 GAO study found that states have a variety of invasive requirements for women claiming abortion coverage under Hyde including provider certification of rape incest or life endangerment beneficiary certification of rape or incest documentation such as police report or report with a public health agency of rape or incest prior authorization and prior certification of counseling for the abortion. For example since 2013 Iowa has required formal approval from the Office of the Governor in order to secure reimbursement for any abortions covered by Medicaid. Another requirement of the Medicaid program is that all drugs included in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program must be covered. Mifeprex the prescription drug most commonly used for medication abortions is a drug included in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and therefore must be covered by all state Medicaid programs. Most abortions occur in the first trimester when medication abortion is an option and over half of abortions nationally are now medication abortions. However the same 2019 GAO report found that 14 state Medicaid programs did not cover Mifeprex. Medicaid is a significant source of health coverage for women who have higher rates of abortion in the U.S. including women with low incomes and women of color. Today Medicaid covers one in five women 20 of reproductive age 1549 years living in Hyde states. In 2022 over half 51 of women below the Federal Poverty Level FPL living in Hyde states were insured by Medicaid Figure 2. This number is decreasing though with the unwinding of the Public Health Emergency PHE protections put in place in response to the COVID19 pandemic that had allowed people to maintain their Medicaid coverage throughout the PHE. However the program will continue to remain the main source of coverage for young women with low incomes. Since the Dobbs ruling the number of abortions nationally has risen compared to the preDobbs period. However there is large variation between states and regions. While there has been an increase in the number of abortions in states where it remains legal there have been steep drops in states with bans to nearly 0 and gestational limits. Some people in states with bans have been able to travel to other states to obtain abortions. However there are significant financial and logistical obstacles to traveling for an out of state abortion and many people with low incomes may not have the funds and resources to do so. Without coverage for abortion under Medicaid women must pay outofpocket for the procedure or rely on abortion funds or borrow money from friends or family to cover the costs. Costs vary by location facility and gestational age but in 2021 the median outofpocket costs a first trimester abortion were 568 for a medication abortion and 625 for a procedural abortion. The costs of abortion are higher in the second trimester compared to the first with median selfpay of 775. Abortion costs are higher in states with more restrictive policies and even more for people living in states with abortion bans when you take into account the cost of travel childcare lodging lost wages and abortion care itself. Though the vast majority 90 of abortions are performed in the first trimester of pregnancy the costs are challenging for many people with low incomes. According to the Federal Reserve Board 37 of U.S. adults do not have enough savings to pay for a 400 emergency expense. People covered by Medicaid in states that use state funds to pay for abortion have no outofpocket costs for abortion. State Medicaid programs only cover services provided in the state. So people are not able to travel to another state and use their own state Medicaid coverage to pay for services. The Turnaway Study found that many of those who received an abortion at any gestational period faced logistical barriers including difficulty finding a provider and raising funds for the procedure and travel but these barriers were more common and had greater consequences for those seeking an abortion at or after 20 weeks gestation. It is more difficult to find a provider for abortions later in pregnancy and the procedure is more expensive. Approximately 4 of abortions are performed at 16 weeks or later in the pregnancy. For people with medically complicated health situations or who need a secondtrimester abortion the costs can be prohibitive. In some cases people find they have to delay their abortion while they take time to raise funds or in other cases they were not able to obtain abortions because they cannot afford the costs of the procedure. Furthermore people who first learn of a fetal anomaly in the second trimester when the costs are considerably higher can face significant costs if they seek to terminate a pregnancy that may not be viable. For many people with low incomes the lack of Medicaid coverage for abortion is a major barrier to abortion access that existed long before the Dobbs decision. One study from before the Dobbs decision estimated that 29 of pregnant Medicaideligible women in Louisiana would have had abortions instead of giving birth if Medicaid covered abortions. Not surprisingly states that do not use state funds to cover abortions outside of the Hyde limitations pay for substantially fewer abortions. In 2014 52 of abortion patients residing in states that use their own funds to pay for abortion had the procedure covered by Medicaid compared to 1.5 of patients who lived in states adhering to Hyde restrictions. This stark differential strongly suggests that if abortion coverage were to be expanded under Medicaid more people would qualify for abortion coverage and the number of abortions paid for by the program would rise. Today 5.5 million women are enrolled in Medicaid and live in states where abortion remains legal but the program will not cover the service except for limited Hyde circumstances Figure 3. However the extent of the change in Medicaidfunded abortions would likely vary considerably by state as it would be affected by a range of factors including state laws reimbursement rates and the availability of providers. For example some states already have or could enact laws that prohibit state dollars from being used for abortion in the same way that they now ban coverage through private plans and the ACA Marketplace plans. Advocates who support abortion rights are working to counteract these efforts through federal legislation such as the Abortion Justice Act and the EACH Woman Act which would both seek to prohibit the federal and state governments from restricting insurance coverage for abortion in both public and private health insurance programs. Beyond Hyde these advocates are working to expand and protect abortion access through court challenges to bans and efforts to pass state and federal laws. Advocates who oppose abortion are working to make Hyde permanent law and are endorsing the passage of federal legislation such as amending Title I8 of the United States Code to prohibit abortion in cases where a fetal heartbeat is detectable and to pass the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion and Abortion Insurance Full Disclosure Act that would make Hydetype restrictions on abortion funding permanent and applicable governmentwide rather than as a temporary policy rider. In a divided Congress none of these proposals are likely to be enacted. Removing the Hyde amendment from the appropriations bill would not automatically grant abortion coverage to women covered under other programs with Hydelike restrictions. In order for Peace Corps workers federal employees and others who are receiving federally funded health benefits outside of the HHS Appropriations bill to obtain abortion coverage the Hydelike provisions would need to be lifted from the Congressionally approved appropriations bills that fund those federal programs. For women covered by Indian Health Services TRICARE or Veteran Affairs to obtain abortion coverage additional congressional action would be required to change the authorizing laws Appendix Table 2. Despite higher shares of people with private insurance and Medicaid resulting from the coverage expansions established by the ACA coverage for abortion services remains limited. Pregnant people who qualify for Medicaid are by definition lowincome and will likely struggle to find the resources to pay for their abortions. While the removal of the Hyde Amendment could broaden this abortion coverage for millions of women with low incomes who receive federally subsidized health coverage the true impact of such a policy change would vary by program and state especially given the context of the abortion bans. Forty years after the first time the Hyde Amendment was first applied to a federal appropriations bill the law is still being debated reflecting the persistently polarized nature of the abortion debate in the United States.

https://www.plannedparenthoodaction.org/issues/attacks-access-planned-parenthood, For years backward politicians in Congress and statehouses across the country have attacked Planned Parenthood s patients access to care. We ve got news for them Planned Parenthood s health centers provide highquality affordable reproductive health care including abortion to 2.4 million people across the country and Planned Parenthood is not backing down. When politicians talk about defunding Planned Parenthood they really mean blocking patients who depend on public health care funds from getting their care at Planned Parenthood health centers. Many of these patients are people with low incomes who don t have health insurance or who rely on public health care funding like Medicaid. People on this type of assistance can t use federal funding for abortion because of an unfair federal policy called the Hyde Amendment which has very narrow exceptions. So attempts to block these patients from getting care at Planned Parenthood only keeps them from getting preventive services like birth control and lifesaving cancer and STD screenings.  Antiabortion politicians have been on a yearslong crusade against Planned Parenthood. Former Vice President Mike Pence introduced the very first federal legislation to defund Planned Parenthood back in 2007. Reproductive health champions beat it down but it was just one of many such attacks. In 2015 antiabortion extremists released deceptively edited videos that made false claims about Planned Parenthood health centers. The videos were completely debunked but antiabortion members of Congress state legislators and presidential candidates used the faked videos to push their antiPlanned Parenthood agenda. Thankfully thenPresident Barack Obama blocked the defund legislation. Meanwhile Planned Parenthood was cleared of all wrongdoing and sued the video attack perpetrators. But that hasn t stopped extreme politicians from going after Planned Parenthood patients particularly at the state level. Although the claims politicians and extremists make against Planned Parenthood are false the consequences are very real when politicians block people s access to health care. Just take Texas for instance  Defunding Planned Parenthood led to a 27 increase in births among women on Medicaid who previously had access to injectable contraception. Texas publicly funded family planning programs served 46 fewer patients. More than half of all Texas women reported at least one barrier to reproductive health care Spanishspeaking women from Mexico were more likely to report three or more barriers. So what s the good news? Planned Parenthood s supporters are standing up and fighting back! We re lobbying public officials and working to elect reproductive health champions. Here s more on politicians deceptive attempts to block access to reproductive health care at Planned Parenthood and on how to get involved in defending patients access to care Stand With Planned ParenthoodThere are tons of ways to defend Planned Parenthood and the lifesaving lifechanging services its health centers provide.

Then see how Planned Parenthood was cleared of all wrongdoing and successfully sued the video attack perpetrators who were found liable of fraud and much more.
