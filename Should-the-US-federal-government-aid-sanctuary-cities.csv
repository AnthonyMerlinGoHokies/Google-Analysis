https://www.scott.senate.gov/media-center/press-releases/sen-scott-colleagues-introduce-the-stop-dangerous-sanctuary-cities-act/, WASHINGTON U.S. Senator Tim Scott RS.C. joined Senators Ted Cruz RTexas John Cornyn RTexas Shelley Moore Capito RW.Va. Chuck Grassley RIowa Thom Tillis RN.C. Mike Rounds RS.D. John Hoeven RN.D. Tommy Tuberville RAla. John Boozman RArk. Cindy HydeSmith RMiss. and other Senate Republican colleagues in reintroducing the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act. Often sanctuary cities prohibit their law enforcement officers from cooperating with federal immigration authorities. This bill would allow local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration authorities and would pull taxpayerfunded grants to sanctuary cities.   Sanctuary cities have emboldened criminals and endangered American citizens and it is wrong that our taxpayers are being forced to foot the bill for this reprehensible policy said Senator Scott. This legislation will bring commonsense back to the table by eliminating taxpayer grants to these criminal safe havens and empowering law enforcement to protect our communities.   Socalled sanctuary cities refuse to enforce the laws on the books and release violent criminals in our country illegally including rapists and murders who go on to prey on both American citizens and the immigrant community. Moreover many of these sanctuary jurisdictions actively prevent state and local law enforcement from coordinating with their federal counterparts. They release murderers rapists and burglars who end up preying on the community. That is wrong. The American people and Texas communities in particular are tired of seeing our laws flouted and the crime that often accompanies illegal immigration. These jurisdictions need to be held accountable and I will do everything I can to enforce our immigration laws said Senator Cruz.  Sanctuary cities undermine our nation s legal immigration system and prevent law enforcement from being able to do their jobs. By promoting coordination between local and federal officials this bill ensures these safe havens for dangerous criminals don t receive certain taxpayerfunded grants and I m proud to support it said Senator Cornyn.  Our country welcomes individuals from around the world who want to be a part of our country but we expect everyone to follow the rule of law and obtain residency or citizenship through the legal process. Our laws must be enforced as written and any city that chooses not to enforce federal immigration laws should not be allowed to use federal funds to support their liberal activist efforts to undermine law and order said Senator Capito.  When the whims of local politicians prevent law enforcement officers from doing their jobs our communities are less safe and our nation s rule of law is shortchanged. City governments should not tie the hands of their law enforcement officers who are trying to comply with federal immigration law. Any city that chooses to force their officers to ignore our laws doesn t deserve the benefit of taxpayerfunded federal grants said Senator Grassley.  Reckless sanctuary policies have allowed dangerous criminals back into communities in North Carolina and that number will continue to increase as liberal politicians put politics ahead of the safety and security of their constituents. This legislation is a step towards law and order and will help ensure state and local law enforcement cooperate with federal immigration authorities to stop violent criminals who are here illegally. I have long fought against sanctuary cities and am proud to work on this legislation with my colleagues said Senator Tillis.  We are a nation of laws. If local and state governments fail to uphold our laws that seek to keep families safe and stop dangerous criminals there should be consequences. These laws are on the books to improve public safety and strengthen national security. We must take action if we are ever to find a longterm solution to strengthen our borders and fix the current border crisis said Senator Rounds.  The crisis at our southern border is out of control. To get a handle on it the Biden administration needs to enforce our laws. Sanctuary cities disregard federal immigration laws and need to be held accountable for their actions. This legislation will help to stop sanctuary cities and ensure that we are upholding the law of the land and maintaining the rule of law said Senator Hoeven.  President Biden s immigration policies have created a disaster at our southern border. Liberalrun cities that support those policies and refuse to enforce immigration law are adding fuel to a fire that s hurting Americans. Cracking down on cities that endorse and facilitate illegal immigration is a commonsense way we can begin to reverse President Biden s border crisis said Senator Tuberville.  Sanctuary cities that prohibit their law enforcement officers from working with federal immigration authorities not only undermine our federal immigration laws but also put lawabiding citizens at risk and create even more of an incentive for illegal immigration. This is the last thing we need as the humanitarian and national security crisis on our southern border exacerbated by the Biden administration s policies continues to rage. I am proud to support this legislation and I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure law and order is upheld in every community said Senator Boozman.   It is incomprehensible that cities and states willfully block enforcement of our immigration laws particularly with the undeniable crisis at our southern border staring us in the face. The rule of law is vital to keeping our citizens safe and there should be consequences for cities who refuse to make Americans safety a priority. This bill would not only ensure that law enforcement officers can cooperate with federal immigration officers but it would see to it that cities are not rewarded with taxpayerfunded grants for flouting our laws said Senator HydeSmith. Organizations that support this bill include the Sergeants Benevolent Association of the New York City Police Department the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association the National Association of Police Organizations and the AFLCIO.  Sanctuary policies not only jeopardize public safety they also place an impossible burden on law enforcement officers who have taken an oath to enforce the laws equally and impartially. The Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act will ensure that my members and police officers across this country no longer must choose between obeying local political dictates and the duty to protect their communities by cooperating with federal immigration officials to turn over violent criminals. We appreciate the leadership of Sen. Cruz in reintroducing this important legislation said Vincent Vallelong President of the Sergeants Benevolent Association SBA of the New York City Police Department NYPD.   Law enforcement is best able to maintain public safety when we work together at all levels. Unfortunately sanctuary cities inhibit law enforcement collaboration even when officers on the ground have a strong desire to work with federal agencies. This is a dangerous game to play. Especially considering federal law enforcement will not abdicate our authority to enforce the law against those that pose a threat. Therefore sanctuary cities merely require additional federal resources to fill intelligence gaps and impose additional risks on law enforcement responding to situations. We applaud Senator Cruz for continuing this initiative to end sanctuary cities said Larry Cosme President of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association FLEOA.   Sanctuary cities across the country have adopted policies which undermine cooperation with federal law enforcement agencies. These policies have allowed violent offending illegal immigrants to run rampant in our cities and endanger innocent lives. The Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act recognizes the threat posed by these violent offenders and encourages local governments to comply with federal requests to detain these criminals. This act will provide necessary tools to help prevent crime and ensure our streets are safer for the American people. We stand with Senator Cruz in support of this bill and thank him for his support on this vital issue said Bill Johnson the Executive Director of the National Association of Police Organizations.   The notion that a municipality can forbid law enforcement officials from sharing information or complying with a lawful detainer from federal immigration officials borders on insanity. We have seen repeatedly the victimization of people including children by persons who have been released from custody in disobedience to these detainers. For the federal government to assist these municipalities with funding is also absurd said Sam Cabral the International President for International Union of Police Associations AFLCIO. Sens.

https://www.procon.org/headlines/sanctuary-cities-top-3-pros-and-cons/, Some argue that sanctuary cities such as San Francisco New York and Chicago should not receive federal funding because they are not enforcing federal immigration laws. Others say that sanctuary city policies protect both citizens and undocumented immigrants. There are 11 states 40 cites and 143 counties listed as sanctuary jurisdictions by the Center for Immigration Studies as of Mar. 22 2021. 32  Florida banned sanctuary cities on June 14 2019 joining at least 11 other states with similar rules according to CNN. Representatives in other states have since pushed for sanctuary cities bans including New Hampshire Georgia and Oklahoma. 22 24 25 26  Sanctuary cities grew from the Sanctuary Movement the late 1980s and early 1990s in which religious congregations began helping undocumented Salvadorian and Guatemalan families settle in the United States. They acted in direct defiance of US immigration authorities who denied over 90 of asylum requests by immigrants fleeing violence in El Salvador and Guatemala. The sanctuary activists believed that the federal government was breaking international and domestic refugee law. 1 2 Los Angeles was the first city to enact sanctuary policies with a focus on undocumented immigrants already in the United States. The chief of police enacted Special Order No. 40 on Nov. 27 1979 stating that police officers should not inquire about immigration status and should provide city services to everyone equally. San Francisco followed suit passing the City of Refuge resolution in 1985 and City of Refuge ordinance in 1989 requiring that all city employees stop immigration policing and provide city services to all residents regardless of immigration status. 2 12 29 The Trump administration held that the federal government should be able to withhold funds from sanctuary cities for their noncompliance with federal laws. The Biden administration reversed that policy. 22 27 28 3031  Josh Harkinson of Mother Jones says undocumented immigrant cooperation with police is statistically proven to make sanctuary cities safer. 15  Murder rates in San Francisco one of the oldest sanctuary cities were at their lowest in 2014 with 45 murders since the 1989 City of Refuge ordinance was enacted. 15  San Francisco s murder rate is lower than comparable nonsanctuary cities with 5.75 murders per 100000 residents in 2013 compared to 11.39 in Dallas and 15.17 in Indianapolis. 15  70 of undocumented immigrants are less likely to report being the victim of a crime and 45 of Latinos are less likely report crimes or voluntarily offer information about a crime for fear police officers would about their immigration status. The fear of being asked about immigration status also makes people less likely to cooperate with investigations. 15 16 19 The Tenth Amendment of the US Constitution provides for the separation of federal and state powers. According to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center the Amendment prevents the federal government from coercing state or local governments to use their resources to enforce a federal regulatory program like immigration and thus Congress cannot compel state or local governments to collect immigration status information in order to share it with the federal government. 4 7 Because the data is never collected due to don t ask don t tell policies the local and state governments are not in violation of federal law. 4  Many people believe that the federal immigration deportation policies are unjust because they target undocumented immigrants indiscriminately deport people who have lived in the United States since childhood deport people who have committed no crimes separate families and cause people to live in constant fear of deportation and its devastating consequences. 11  Libby Schaaf Mayor of Oakland California said I like to compare this to conscientious objector status. We are not going to use our resources to enforce what we believe are unjust immigration laws. 11  Juan Francisco LopezSanchez an undocumented immigrant had seven felony convictions in the United States and had been deported from the country five times. Yet the city of San Francisco declined to detain him for Immigration and Customs Enforcement Officials ICE officials and released him into the community. In July 2015 LopezSanchez was charged with murdering Katie Steinle in San Francisco. 8 9 Of 8145 undocumented immigrants released from detention requests between Jan. 1 2014 and Aug. 31 2014 5132 63 had previous criminal convictions or were marked a public safety concern 2984 36.6 had felony charges or convictions 1909 23.4 had misdemeanor convictions or charges related to violence assault sexual abuse weapons or drug distribution and 239 2.9 had three or more misdemeanor convictions. 18 8 U.S. Code 1373 states that a Federal State or local government entity or official may not prohibit or in any way restrict any government entity or official from sending to or receiving from the Immigration and Naturalization Service information regarding the citizenship or immigration status lawful or unlawful of any individual. 5 The Department of Justice requires that most recipients of federal grant money certify their compliance with all federal laws. Sanctuary cities by not asking about recording and submitting to the federal government the immigration statuses of residents are violating federal law and the rules for getting federal grant money. 4 6 Sanctuary policies prevent police from investigating questioning and arresting people who have broken federal immigration law. Many crimes violent and otherwise could be prevented if local law enforcement in sanctuary cities could arrest undocumented immigrants for their first crime on US soil illegal entry into the country and turn them over to federal law enforcement. 14 According to Heather Mac Donald Thomas W. Smith Fellow at the Manhattan Institute many Salvadorian gang members living in Los Angeles entered the United States illegally but because of sanctuary policies LA police officers cannot arrest the undocumented immigrants for illegal entry. Instead law enforcement has to wait for a second crime to be committed to get the criminals off the street. 14 Discussion Questions 1. How would you summarize the reasons why cities or states might decline to cooperate with the federal government on detention requests? What other solutions can you think of to address their concerns? 2. Should the federal government be allowed to withhold funding based on any reasons it decides? Why or why not? 3. Which side do you find most compelling? List three specific pieces of supporting evidence from the article or from additional research that support your view. 1. Consider the argument that sanctuary cities do not suffer increased crime from Daniel E. Mart nez and Ricardo D. Mart nezSchuldt. 2. Explore the topic of sanctuary cities at Learning for Justice. 3. Analyze Hans von Spakovsky s argument that sanctuary cities make us less safe. 4. Consider how you felt about the issue before reading this article. After reading the pros and cons on this topic has your thinking changed? If so how? List two to three ways. If your thoughts have not changed list two to three ways your better understanding of the other side of the issue now helps you better argue your position. 5.

https://cis.org/Report/Still-Subsidizing-Sanctuaries, Whistleblower Contact Whistleblower Contact Listen to the accomapanying podcast here. Jessica Vaughan is the director of policy studies and Nathan Desautels is an intern at the Center for Immigration Studies.  In 2021 the Department of Justice gave out approximately 300 million to sanctuary jurisdictions under three funding programs the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program SCAAP the Byrne Justice Assistance Grants JAG and the Community Oriented Policing Services COPS program. The awards to sanctuaries represented more than 40 percent of the available funding under these programs. Sanctuary jurisdictions are receiving this funding despite having adopted policies to hinder cooperation between local law enforcement agencies and federal immigration authorities. As a result the federal government is subsidizing agencies that may be violating federal law and undermining public safety. The Center for Immigration Studies has identified nearly 300 states and localities that have adopted sanctuary policies.1 These cities counties and states have laws ordinances regulations resolutions policies or other practices that obstruct immigration enforcement and shield criminals from ICE either by refusing to or prohibiting agencies from complying with ICE detainers imposing unreasonable conditions on detainer acceptance denying ICE access to interview incarcerated aliens or otherwise impeding communication or information exchanges between their personnel and federal immigration officers. Certain of these policies have been found to be a violation of federal law 8 USC 1373 and 1644 which says that no state or local government may prohibit or in any way restrict local officials from communicating with federal immigration authorities about a person s immigration status.2 Our analysis examines three DOJ grant programs the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program SCAAP the Edward M. Byrne Justice Assistance Grant Byrne JAG and the Community Oriented Policing Services COPS. The purpose of SCAAP is to reimburse state and local prisons and jails for a portion of the cost of incarcerating illegal aliens who were held on state and local charges.3 The Byrne JAG program is the leading source of federal justice funding that goes directly to state and local jurisdictions for a range of activities including prosecution and law enforcement.4 The COPS grant program provides funding for community policing efforts in localities around the country.5 These DOJ programs are among the largest sources of federal funding for state and local law enforcement agencies. Longstanding eligibility rules require that recipients must be in compliance with all federal laws. Beginning in 2016 congressional appropriators and Justice Department officials stipulated that this included the provisions in federal law that prohibit certain sanctuary policies and took steps to block certain jurisdictions from receiving funds under these programs.6 Several jurisdictions moved to change their policies including MiamiDade County in Florida and others refused to change but were blocked from certain DOJ funding programs. A series of lawsuits ensued with varying outcomes resulting in an attempted appeal to the Supreme Court which dismissed the cases as moot7 after the incoming Biden administration rescinded the rules barring sanctuaries.8 This report examines the distribution of SCAAP Byrne JAG and COPS funding to sanctuary jurisdictions in 2021 which are presented in Table 1. The award amounts and total available funds are compiled from publicly available award announcements on the Justice Department web site.9 Nearly 300 million went to sanctuary jurisdictions in 2021 from these three federal law enforcement grants alone. This total represents a substantial level of federal grant funding going toward jurisdictions that refuse to cooperate with or deliberately hinder federal immigration enforcement. Considering that nearly all of the federal immigration enforcement within the country is directed at removing aliens who have committed crimes and who are quite likely to reoffend if allowed to remain in the community the sanctuary policies undeniably are undermining public safety and undercutting the effectiveness of the DOJ programs from which they receive funding. According to one government report about 25 percent of criminal alien offenders who were released by sanctuary jurisdictions were subsequently arrested again within eight months of release.10 Sanctuary policies tend to attract illegal migration and provide a haven for illegal aliens involved in crime. Several drug dealers interviewed for a recent San Francisco Chronicle investigative story on the involvement of illegal aliens from Honduras in the city s drug trade confirmed as much telling the reporters that Honduran illegal migrants flock to the city in large part because they know that the city s sanctuary policies will help them avoid deportation The reason is because in San Francisco it s like you re here in Honduras. The law because they don t deport that s the problem. ... Many look for San Francisco because it s a sanctuary city. You go to jail and you come out. 11 Now instead of requiring awardees to demonstrate that they are in compliance with the federal law on sanctuary policies DOJ has begun requiring recipient agencies to provide information on their adherence to certain Biden administration policing policy preferences. For instance to receive a Byrne JAG grant since January 2022 law enforcement agency applicants must complete a questionnaire seeking attestations on matters such as the agencies use of force policies policies andor procedures that incorporate best practices on officer hiring recruitment and retention to include diversity equity and inclusion and efforts to address racial ethnic gender and LGBTQIA bias.12 While it may not be possible for the federal government to compel state and local governments to cooperate with federal immigration authorities it is reasonable for the federal government to try to discourage sanctuary policies and penalize jurisdictions that choose to obstruct such a legitimate and vital federal activity. The limits on a president s authority to do so have yet to be fully defined in the courts but in the meantime Congress certainly has the authority to impose conditions on federal funding programs that could block access for sanctuary jurisdictions. In addition the existence of sanctuary policies should be recognized by the federal government citizens and other stakeholders as a potential risk factor on the same level as other governance considerations for example when issuing bond credit ratings or other assessments of a state or local government s stability. Finally state governments can take action to penalize or prohibit local sanctuary policies as Texas Florida and eight other states have done. 1 Jessica M.

While there is no official legal definition of sanctuary city the term generally refers to towns cities or counties that decline to cooperate completely with federal detention requests related to undocumented immigrants often with a don t ask don t tell policy.  There are 11 states 37 cites and 134 counties listed as sanctuary jurisdictions by the Center for Immigration Studies as of Mar. 23 2020. Florida banned sanctuary cities on June 14 2019 joining at least 11 other states with similar rules according to CNN. Representatives in other states have since pushed for sanctuary cities bans including New Hampshire Georgia and Oklahoma.
