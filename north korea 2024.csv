Bennett This commentary originally appeared on The National Interest on April 9 2024. North Korea is working toward the deployment of hypersonic missiles that it claims could render South Korean and U.S. missile defenses useless. Still its claims of a successful test this month appear greatly exaggerated. An advanced fully developed hypersonic missile could allow the North to pose a serious threat against South Korea. Such a missile could fly very fast very low maneuver to counter defenses and accurately hit its targets potentially defeating South Korean and U.S. missile defenses and making targets in South Korea vulnerable. North Koreas bluster about its test is clearly aimed at creating an environment of fear in South Korea and elsewhere. On April 2 North Korea launched what it claimed was an intermediaterange missile equipped with a newly developed hypersonic gliding flight warhead. North Korean state media announced that the hypersonic glide warhead reached its first peak at a height of 101.1 kilometers and the second at 72.3 kilometers while making a 1000kmlong flight as planned to accurately hit waters in the East Sea.  While South Korea Japan and the United States dont reveal their full technical findings on missile tests the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff JCS showed that this North Korean missile is still early in development and thus is not currently a serious threat. Consider this evidence. The JCS said the missile launch was designed to test its ability to fly. The missile did fly though neither as far as an intermediate range 3000 to 5500 km nor to the exaggerated North Korean claim of 1000 km it only went 600 to 650 km according to South Korea and Japan. So was the North Korean flight at least a partial failure if not a significant one or was it a partial test with limited fuel? The North claimed that it intentionally delayed the ignition of the missiles secondstage engine and changed the direction of flight. However the South Korean JCS says the intentional ignition delay was also an exaggeration.  The remainder of this commentary is available at nationalinterest.org. Bruce W.

https://freedomhouse.org/country/north-korea/freedom-world/2024, North Korea is a oneparty state led by a dynastic totalitarian dictatorship that regularly engages in grave human rights abuses. Surveillance is pervasive arbitrary arrests and detention are common and punishments for political offenses are severe. The state maintains a system of camps for political prisoners where torture forced labor starvation and other atrocities take place. Kim Jongun became the country s supreme leader in 2011 after the death of his father Kim Jongil who had led North Korea since his father s death in 1994. In 2016 the State Affairs Commission SAC became the country s top ruling organ and Kim Jongun was named its chairman. In 2019 Kim was reelected as SAC chairman by the Supreme People s Assembly SPA the unicameral legislature and given the new title of supreme representative of all the Korean people and the supreme leader of the Republic.  Members of the 687seat SPA are elected to fiveyear terms. The Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland DFRF a coalition dominated by the ruling Korean Workers Party KWP alongside a handful of subordinate parties and organizations preselects all candidates who then run unopposed. Voting is compulsory for citizens who are at least 17 years old and turnout commonly approaches 100 percent. Preselected candidates won every seat in the 2019 SPA elections. Although there is a clear framework for conducting and monitoring elections the system s structure denies voters any choice and precludes opposition to the incumbent leadership. The government uses the mandatory elections as an unofficial census tracking whether and how people voted and interpreting any rejection of the preselected candidates as treason. North Korea is effectively a oneparty state. The small number of minor groups that legally exist are all are members of the DFRF. Political dissent and opposition are prohibited and harshly punished. The country has been ruled by the KWP which the Kim family has always controlled since its founding. Kim Jongun was promoted from KWP chairman to secretary general in 2021. His late father Kim Jongil was dubbed the KWP s eternal general secretary after his death. There is no opportunity for public political participation and even KWP elites operate under the threat of extreme penalties for perceived dissent or disloyalty. The party is subject to regular purges aimed at reinforcing Kim Jongun s personal authority. The regime has executed senior officials who have fallen out of favor. North Korea is ethnically homogeneous with only a small Chinese population and a few nonChinese foreign residents. With few exceptions foreigners cannot join the KWP or serve in the military or government. Religious groups are harshly suppressed and unable to organize politically. Women hold few leadership positions in ruling bodies and occupy only 121 of the SPA s 687 seats the system does not allow these representatives to independently address the interests of women. The government typically denies the existence of LGBT people in North Korea. North Korea has no freely elected officials. Kim Jongun and his inner circle determine policy and the SPA gathers periodically to unanimously approve all decisions. Highlevel officials are subject to constant churn based on their performance and their perceived loyalty to Kim Jongun. Corruption is believed to be endemic at every level of the state and economy and government officials commonly engage in bribery. No independent or impartial anticorruption mechanisms exist. Smallscale local markets have become prime targets of corrupt police officers who solicit bribes from operators and detain those who cannot pay. Market participants also pay bribes to supervisors at their official workplaces to avoid discipline or imprisonment for abandoning stateassigned roles. The government operates opaquely and without accountability. Information about the functioning of state institutions is tightly controlled for both domestic and external audiences. Authorities restricted COVID19related information disclosing only fragmentary publichealth data including the number of COVID19 cases and deaths according to official figures which outside experts called unreliable. Little information about vaccination rollouts was provided. The state runs all domestic media outlets. Televisions and radios are permanently fixed to state channels. All publications and broadcasts are strictly supervised and censored. The regime rarely allows a small number of foreign books films and television programs to be distributed and aired in the country. Several foreign news agencies have established bureau offices in Pyongyang. However their access is tightly controlled and media crews have been expelled in retaliation for their work. Select foreign media services are often invited to cover key political events and holidays although authorities strictly manage their visits. Several US and South Korean outlets broadcast shortwave and mediumwave Koreanlanguage radio programming into North Korea though the regime works to jam their stations. Campaigns to send information into the country via external storage devices and leaflets are common and North Koreans often modify their radios to receive foreign broadcasts. A South Korean law banning the transmission of leaflets and other information across the border without government permission took effect in 2021 but was struck down by the South Korean Constitutional Court in September 2023. The consumption of foreign radio broadcasts and possession of contraband devices in North Korea is illegal as are the facilitation and nonreporting of such activity all are subject to severe punishment under an antireactionary thought law up to and including the death penalty. Although freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed it does not exist in practice. Statesanctioned churches maintain a token presence in Pyongyang and some North Koreans are known to practice their faith furtively. However intense state indoctrination and repression preclude free and open exercise of religion. Crackdowns are common and those caught including foreigners are arrested and subjected to harsh punishments including imprisonment in labor camps. In 2021 nongovernmental organization NGO Open Doors US estimated that 50000 to 70000 Christians were being held in prison camps. A 2022 report by the International Bar Association and the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea HRNK found that Christians are singled out for especially harsh treatment in North Korean prisons. There is no academic freedom. The state must approve all curriculums including those of educational programs led by foreigners. Although some North Koreans are permitted to study abroad at both universities and shortterm educational training programs they are subject to monitoring and reprisals for perceived disloyalty. Nearly all forms of private communication are monitored by a huge network of informants. Domestic thirdgeneration 3G mobile service available since 2008 may serve at least 6.5 million subscribers. Ordinary mobile users can connect to a staterun intranet but not the global internet. Mobile phones operating on this network function as state surveillance tools which can review individuals application usage and browsing history and take screenshots of activity. Newer mobile phones include measures to prevent the consumption of contraband media with some resorting to hacking to circumvent them.  Only a few elites have internet access reaching it through their own service. Domestic and international mobile services are kept strictly separate. Individuals using Chineseorigin phones have faced crackdowns while officials sent to China must install surveillance software on their devices. People returning from foreign postings or trips abroad are heavily monitored. Freedom of assembly is not recognized. Participants in unauthorized gatherings are subject to severe punishment including imprisonment. There are no legal associations or organizations other than those created by the state and ruling party. Strikes collective bargaining and other organized labor activities are illegal and can draw severe punishment for participants including imprisonment. North Korea s judiciary is subordinate to the political leadership in law and in practice. According to the constitution the Central Court the country s highest court is accountable to the SPA and its duties include protecting state power and the socialist system.  Fundamental due process rights including freedom from arbitrary detention and the right to a fair trial are systematically denied. Credible reports estimate that as many as 120000 people may be held in political prison camps as of March 2023. Foreign visitors are also at risk of arbitrary detention. As of November six South Korean citizens were being detained in North Korea. The six had been in North Korean custody for several years after being accused of crimes such as espionage and kidnapping. In July US Army private Travis King illegally entered North Korea by crossing the DMZ at its border with South Korea. King was then taken into custody by North Korean security forces. The North Korean government expelled King in September releasing him into US custody after he was convicted of illegally intruding into the country. The regime sometimes grants amnesty to or otherwise releases prisoners. In 2022 thousands were released to celebrate the late Kim Jongil s birthday via sentence reductions though many were in poor physical condition. No dissidents were released. Documented human rights violations include widespread torture public executions forced labor by detainees and death sentences for political offenses. A 2021 UN report noted that forced labor and torture are rampant in the prison system and that citizens often pay bribes to avoid arrest mitigate treatment in detention and secure family visits. Defectors who seek safety in neighboring third countries are sometimes returned to North Korea where they face torture and disproportionate punishment. China s government considers North Korean escapees to be irregular economic migrants and regularly turns them back violating international law.  The unresolved conflict with South Korea around North Korea s nuclear weapons program poses a threat to physical security and negotiations with Seoul and Washington remained stalled in 2023. The North Korean government launched numerous missile tests during the year and successfully launched a reconnaissance military satellite in November. In August the regime conducted a tactical nuclearstrike drill simulating an attack on South Korea in response to US South Korean joint military exercises. In September the legislature unanimously voted to enshrine North Korea s nuclear program in the constitution. Kim Jongun said that the changes which make the policy of growing the country s nuclear capacity a permanent law of the state will accelerate the modernization of nuclear weapons and strengthen national defense capabilities.  Discrimination is commonly based on perceived political and ideological nonconformity. All citizens are classified according to their family s level of loyalty and proximity to the leadership under a semihereditary castelike system known as songbun. Those who are classified as wavering or hostile instead of loyal face official discrimination in employment live in poorer housing and receive limited educational opportunities though rules can be manipulated through bribery. Relatives of suspected political and ideological dissidents including defectors are also subject to punishment in what amounts to guilt by association. The country s ethnic Chinese population has limited educational and employment opportunities but somewhat more freedom of travel and trade.  Women have legal equality but face rigid discrimination in practice and are poorly represented in public employment and the military. Despite fewer opportunities in the formal sector women are economically active in markets which can expose them to arbitrary state interference. A UN report published in March 2023 found that COVID19 restrictions had disproportionately impacted women and girls further exacerbating existing challenges in accessing food medicine health care and livelihoods.  The law does not explicitly prohibit samesex relations but the regime maintains that the practice does not exist in the country. North Korea has historically denied the rights of people living with disabilities. Defectors report that disabled people have been quarantined exiled forcibly sterilized experimented on and sometimes executed. Citizens have no freedom of movement and forced internal resettlement is routine. Emigration is illegal and all foreign travel is strictly controlled by the regime. In recent years authorities have employed stricter domestic controls to stem the flow of defectors who have also been impeded by regional coronavirusrelated travel restrictions. The Unification Ministry reported that while over 1000 defectors entered the country in 2019 only 196 did so in 2023. Freedom of movement for foreigners is also limited and subject to arbitrary constraints. The regime implemented strict pandemiccontainment measures and border controls through August 2023 including lockdowns and restrictions near the Chinese border in 2022. Internal movement was proscribed for periods in 2022 and 2023 to limit the spread of seasonal flu. Increased trade traffic with China and Russia was observed during 2023.  A person s songbun classification affects their place of residence as well as employment and educational opportunities access to medical facilities and even access to stores.  Most North Korean workers cannot freely choose their employment with the government assigning men and unmarried women to their positions and often denying monetary compensation. Workers especially women seek informal employment to earn an income and pay official employers bribes to cover absences. The formal centrally planned economy is grossly mismanaged. A lack of infrastructure scarcity of energy and raw materials lingering foreign debt and ideological isolation also hobble business activity in the country. Informal and governmentapproved private markets and service industries have provided many North Koreans especially women a growing field of activity that is somewhat free from government control. However the COVID19 pandemic hampered access to goods to sell in those markets limiting people s ability to earn discretionary income and increasing dependence on domestic food production and distribution. Local officials have had some discretion in the management of special economic zones and over smallscale experiments with marketoriented economic policies. Men and women have formal equality in personal status matters such as marriage and divorce. However sexual and physical violence against women is common and victims have little legal recourse. There are no specific legal penalties for domestic violence. UN bodies have noted the use of forced abortions on pregnant women when forcibly repatriated from China and infanticide of halfChinese children. Forced labor is common in prison camps mass mobilization programs and staterun contracting arrangements in which North Korean workers are sent abroad. Human trafficking networks sometimes operating with the assistance of government officials target North Korean women those ensnared are subject to sex slavery and forced marriages often in China. Some women have also turned to prostitution to survive in recent years and are exploited by their employers and the police. Economic opportunities are also hampered by international sanctions imposed in response to the regime s continued nuclear pursuits. Since 2016 sanctions have targeted civilian industries including textiles and seafood. North Korea has also been cut off from the international banking system. While this has not deterred the regime s pursuit of nuclear weapons it has created growing difficulties for those dependent on markets and quasiprivate businesses.

In response to North Koreas evolving nuclear threats the United States and South Korea have been strengthening their bilateral military drills and trilateral exercises with Japan. On Monday the chairman of South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff Kim Myungsoo met with U.S. Space Command Commander Stephen N. Waiting for discussions on countering North Korean threats according to South Koreas military.Some experts say North Korea could launch its second spy satellite this month to mark a key anniversary such as the April 15 birthday of its founder Kim Il Sung the late grandfather of leader Kim Jong Un or the April 25 founding anniversary of a predecessor of the Norths military.U.N.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/11/north-koreas-kim-says-now-is-time-to-be-prepared-for-war-state-media, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un says now is the time to be more prepared for war than ever as he visited the country s main military university state media reported. He made his remarks on the same day as rival South Korea s parliamentary elections on Wednesday in which the governing party suffered a major defeat the official Korean Central News Agency KCNA said on Thursday.  Now is the time to be more thoroughly prepared for a war than ever before the North Korean leader said at the Kim Jong Il University of Military and Politics citing the uncertain and unstable military and political situation around. North Korea has in recent months stepped up its accusations against South Korea and its ally the United States for what it called provoking military tensions by conducting war manoeuvers and holding military drills with greater intensity and scale. In March Kim also ordered heightened war preparations after inspecting troops at a major military operations base in the country s west. North Korea should be more firmly and perfectly prepared for a war which should be won without fail not just for a possible war he added. Since the election of South Korean President Yoon Sukyeol in 2022 tensions between the two Koreas have been intensifying with the North declaring the South as its principal enemy . In response to Yoon s hardline stance towards the North Kim ordered the scrapping of agencies dedicated to reunification and outreach and threatened war over even 0.001mm of territorial infringement. Kim said if provoked North Korea will deal a death blow to the enemy without hesitation by mobilising all means in its possession . Partially blurred images released by state media showed him surrounded by army officials inspecting what appeared to be a miniature of South Korea s capital Seoul including its Han River along with maps of the peninsula. South Korea s Yoon had taken a tough line with the nucleararmed North while improving ties with the US. North Korea has been increasing its weapons development under Kim and has forged closer military and political ties with Russia. It has also been accused of aiding Russia in its war with Ukraine. In March Russia used its veto power at the United Nations Security Council to effectively end UN expert monitoring of North Korean sanctions violations. Earlier this month Kim supervised the test launch of a new hypersonic intermediaterange ballistic missile using solid fuel which analysts said would bolster the North s ability to deploy missiles more effectively than liquidfuel variants.,

North Korea exhibits a tendency to ramp up provocations during U.S. election years. While diplomacy could stave off some of the violence Kim Jongun has rejected all calls from the Biden administration to meet. Instead the regime has more than doubled the number of tests since 2021 compared to under the previous U.S. administration. A Trump victory in November could conceivably reduce North Korean provocations and increase South Korean talk about going nuclear at the same time. There has been secular growth in North Korean provocations and missile testing over the past four U.S. administrations see Figure 1. These have accelerated further over the past three years representing a 112 percent increase of North Korean testing over the previous U.S. and South Korean administrations see Figure 2. The higher volume of testing over the past three years is due to a number of factors. One reason could be scientific and related to development and perfecting of weapons systems. That is North Korea has an accelerated program of experimental testing for each class of missile it is developing the latest instance being the January 14 test of an alleged intermediate range ballistic missile with a hypersonic warhead vehicle. A second cause for the frequency of demonstrations could be related not to developmental testing but to operational exercising of the short and longerrange missile capabilities. We have seen North Korea carry out for example a series of shortrange ballistic missile SRBM and mediumrange ballistic missile MRBM launches in conjunction with bomber runs. This is not experimental testing rather it is exercising of war plans. A third reason could be related to diplomacy or lack thereof. A study by CSIS found that periods of sustained U.S.Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea DPRK bilateral diplomacy coincide with a relatively lower number of provocations compared with periods when diplomacy is absent.  There is reason to believe that North Korean belligerence will increase in 2024. North Korea tends to ramp up provocations in U.S. election years. According to CSIS data the average number of provocations between January 1 of a major U.S. election year defined as either a midterm election or presidential election through the State of the Union speech by the elected or reelected president the following year has increased by 375 percent or by over 4.5 times during the Kim Jongun regime when compared with the average number of provocations during the preceding government of Kim Jongil see Figure 3.  In addition North Korea tends to ramp up provocations around U.S.ROK military exercises when these exercises are preceded by a period of nondialogue in U.S.DPRK relations according to a previous CSIS study. The United States and South Korea will carry out annual major military maneuver exercises in the first quarter of the year which is likely to be preceded or followed by North Korean provocations. Following on from the directives of the U.S.JapanKorea trilateral leaders summit at Camp David this past summer moreover the three allies plan to carry out the first named trilateral military exercise during the same time frame which Pyongyang will almost certainly respond to.  All these patterns suggest 2024 will be a rocky year. This is not the fault of the Biden administration and its allies. North Korea has shown no interest in dialogue with the United States despite numerous efforts by the administration to make contact. White House officials informally count at least 20 occasions on which they have failed to elicit a response for dialogue without preconditions. Moreover planned military exercises whether bilateral or trilateral are necessary to maintain the credibility of deterrence and hence peace on the peninsula. For the Biden administration to set out a policy goal of staving off these provocations in 2024 would be effectively setting itself up for failure as North Korea is not interested in talking for now. Kim Jongun s New Year address has made clear his plan for least three more longrange rocket launches to put three more satellites into orbit.  Accepting that 2024 will see such provocations may sound too fatalistic of a choice for policymakers but it also ensures that a unilateral lifting of sanctions or suspension of military exercises will not become wasted concessions that damage allied trust and defense readiness. Instead the forthcoming provocations should serve as a platform for greater consolidation of U.S.JapanKorea security ties. This should not only include more and varied forms of trilateral exercising in missile defense early warning datasharing intelligencesharing extended deterrence and contingency planning but also consideration of a firstever bilateral security declaration between Seoul and Tokyo. This could be along the lines of the first iteration of the JapanAustralia security declaration inked in 2007 which stated the common alignment on fundamental security principles. This might eventually build to a revised and more detailed declaration just as Tokyo and Canberra did in 2022. The United States could respond to rampedup North Korean missile demonstrations with more pressure on China to regulate the behavior of its communist brethren. China reportedly has played a role in preventing the longanticipated seventh nuclear test by the North. Although Beijing routinely maintains that its influence over Kim is limited it jealously guards that influence whenever Pyongyang grows closer to other major powers in the neighborhood like the United States Trump in 2018 or Russia Putin today. In this regard rampant missile shots by Kim could be used to motivate Xi Jinping to stop DPRK from further destabilizing China s neighborhood through Kim s recent and burgeoning military cooperation with Russia. Additional sanctions if unable to organize through the UN Security Council could be coordinated under the auspices of the G7 and the NATO Asia Pacific Four Japan South Korea Australia and New Zealand. The Biden administration can pursue these policies in 2024 while still leaving open the prospects for diplomacy however remote. Former U.S. diplomats have written on what could be put on offer as a form of patient engagement in return for a testing moratorium human rights dialogue and other threat reduction measures. Admittedly this will not be easy. A Trump victory in November could result in a decrease in North Korean provocations but ironically could also lead to an increase in South Korean support for acquiring its own nuclear weapons. Trump would likely befriend Kim Jongun again and offer discontinuation of military exercises for a DPRK test ban. Indeed the only year in which North Korea conducted no provocations was in 2018 when Trump made such a deal. This agreement however did little to achieve denuclearization and hurt allied military readiness.  At the same time Trumps America First posture and his willingness to decouple intercontinental ballistic missile ICBM threats to the U.S. homeland from SRBM threats to nearby allies will undermine the credibility of U.S. extended deterrence and would retard much of the work accomplished by the Biden administration s Washington Declaration and Nuclear Consultative Group in shoring up the U.S. nuclear umbrella over its ally. Furthermore Trump s obsession with withdrawing troops from Korea and from other allied bases would rattle credibility in the U.S. security commitment. The result could be increased calls in South Korea among the public and policy elites for going nuclear regardless of the decreased tempo of North Korean provocations and missile exercises.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/4/20/north-korea-conducts-test-on-new-super-large-warhead-state-media, North Korea has conducted a test on a superlarge warhead designed for a strategic cruise missile state media reports adding that it also launched a new type of antiaircraft missile.  The DPRK Missile Administration has conducted a power test of a superlarge warhead designed for Hwasal1 Ra3 strategic cruise missile KCNA news agency reported on Saturday referring to North Korea by an abbreviation for its official name Democratic People s Republic of Korea. North Korea also carried out a test launch on Friday afternoon of a Pyoljji12 which state media said was a newtype antiaircraft missile . KCNA added that a certain goal was attained through the test without providing further details. The weapons tests were part of the regular activities of the administration and its affiliated defence science institutes KCNA reported referencing the operation of newtype weapon systems . The tests had nothing to do with the surrounding situation KCNA added but did not give any further information. In early April North Korea said it had tested a new mediumtolongrange solidfuel hypersonic missile with state media sharing a video of it being launched as leader Kim Jong Un looked on. Cruise missiles are among a growing collection of North Korean weapons designed to overwhelm regional missile defences. They supplement the North s vast arsenal of ballistic missiles including intercontinental variants which are said to be aimed at the continental United States. Analysts say antiaircraft missile technology is an area where North Korea could benefit from its deepening military cooperation with Russia as the two countries align in the face of their separate intensifying confrontations with the US. The US and South Korea have accused the North of providing artillery shells and other equipment to Russia to help extend its warfighting ability in Ukraine. Since its second nuclear test in 2009 Pyongyang has been under heavy international sanctions but the development of its nuclear and weapons programmes has continued unabated.,

A 2014 United Nations Commission of Inquiry COI report found that the government committed systematic widespread and gross human rights violations that constitute crimes against humanity. Ruled by thirdgeneration totalitarian leader Kim Jong Un the government maintains fearful obedience by using threats of torture executions imprisonment enforced disappearances and forced labor. It systematically denies basic liberties including freedom of expression association and religion. It does not tolerate pluralism and it bans independent media civil society organizations and trade unions. In 2023 the government continued to maintain extreme and unnecessary measures under the pretext of protecting against the Covid19 pandemic with deepened isolation and repression border trade and travel restrictions and strong ideological control. These restrictions severely aggravated the existing food crisis and exacerbated the country s chronic lack of access to medicines medical supplies and other necessities. They hurt market activities the population relied on to survive and severely undermined people s ability to make a living in 2023. The impact of the nearly fouryearlong Covid19 nationwide country lockdown intensified as the country was hit by major droughts in March and April and flooding in August. The government continued to prioritize weapons development conducting over 30 missile tests between January and September including three longrange intercontinental ballistic missiles. The government does not permit freedom of thought expression or information. All media is strictly controlled. Accessing phones computers televisions radios or media content that is not sanctioned by the government is illegal and considered antisocialist behavior that is punished including through the use of torture and forced labor. The government regularly cracks down on those accessing unsanctioned media. It also jams Chinese mobile phone services at the border and targets for arrest people for communicating with contacts outside the country. In January 2023 the government enacted the Pyongyang Cultural Language Protection Act banning the use of language that is South Korean in style or appears to have foreign influence. The law criminalized communications in the puppet language a reference to the South Korean language style setting punishments of six years or more of forced labor and even the death penalty in some cases. It also encourages the authorities to use public trials and executions to awaken the masses.  In March and April authorities reportedly conducted public trials in Ryanggang province under the law. One trial targeted 17 young people for watching unsanctioned videos and using South Korean language. One leader of the group was sentenced to 10 years of forced labor. In another trial 20 youth athletes were sentenced to three to five years of forced labor for using South Korean vocabulary. Moving from one province to another or traveling abroad without prior approval continued to be illegal. The government maintained heightened enforcement of a ban on illegal travel to China through border buffer zones on the northern border to protect against Covid19. Border guards remained under orders to unconditionally shoot anyone entering or leaving without permission. Authorities strict enforcement of these restrictions severely impacted people s livelihoods and ability to access food medicines and other essential goods. In August North Korean state media officially announced the reopening of its borders to citizens residing abroad after they were closed in January 2020. North Korea s national airline restarted international flights and the former North Korean ambassador to China returned to North Korea. In March authorities allowed some Chinese diplomats to enter the country. However humanitarian organizations and most diplomats remained unable to return. Informal trade activities stayed banned. Official trade by rail and waterways increased but remained lower than before the Covid19 pandemic. Activist networks in China and South Korea that help North Koreans flee their country and transit through China to a safe third country were able to resume activities but they faced major obstacles due to increased security enforcement and mass surveillance in China. Many North Koreans in China remained hidden in safe houses. The Chinese government continued to seek to detain North Korean asylum seekers and return them to North Korea violating China s obligations as a state party to the UN Refugee Convention. Many North Koreans detained in China were forcibly returned to North Korea 80 in August 40 in September and at least 500 in October where they almost certainly faced grave abuses for their attempted escape. North Korean law states that leaving the country without permission is a crime of treachery against the nation punishable by death. In 2019 over 1000 North Korean asylum seekers were resettled in South Korea but this number declined to 67 in 2022 and only 139 between January and September 2023. North Korea is one of the poorest countries in the world. The government has constantly struggled with chronic food insecurity. Insufficient domestic food production and the government s prioritization of military and security development made the ability of the North Korean people to get food medicine and other necessities almost totally reliant on both official and unofficial trade with China and private product distribution across the country and market activity. The excessive and unnecessary Covid19 related restrictions blocked most sources of income for a large majority of the population reducing their ability to buy any already limited food and basic necessities available in the markets. They adversely impacted the ability of ordinary North Koreans to conduct basic economic activities generally worsening their rights to food health and an adequate standard of living. There were reports of a mass vaccination campaign and a second round of vaccinations for Covid19 in North Pyongan province Nampo port and Pyongyang in September 2022. However there are no official numbers of vaccinated people available. The North Korean government routinely and systematically requires forced uncompensated labor from much of its population to sustain its economy. The government s forced labor demands target women through the Women s Union children at schools workers at stateowned enterprises or deployed abroad detainees in shortterm hard labor detention centers rodong dallyeondae and prisoners at longterm ordinary prison camps kyohwaso and political prison camps. At some point in their lives a significant majority of North Koreans must perform unpaid hard labor often justified by the state as portrayals of loyalty to the government. Since punishment for crimes in North Korea is arbitrary and dependent on a person s record of loyalty personal connections and ability to pay bribes the refusal of a government order to work as a volunteer can result in severe punishment including torture and imprisonment. North Korea remains one of only seven UN member states that has not joined the International Labour Organization. North Korea uses songbun a sociopolitical classification system that in its creation grouped people into loyal wavering or hostile classes and discriminates against those placed in the lower classes in employment housing and education. In February 2023 Elizabeth Salmon the UN special rapporteur on North Korea raised concerns about the disproportionate impact of the Covid19 restrictions on women and girls the declining economic participation of women and the impact on livelihoods since women are the main breadwinners in most families. She also flagged possible increases in domestic violence and economic pressures linked to the pandemic. The government has failed to take any meaningful action to address the country s intense and pervasive women s rights violations including sexual and genderbased violence widespread discrimination and enforcement of rigid gender stereotypes. The 2014 COI report recommended the UN Security Council refer the situation in North Korea to the International Criminal Court. In August 2023 the UN High Commissioner of Human Rights restated this recommendation to the UN Security Council noting its ongoing documentation of crimes and abuses including crimes against humanity against people held in longterm prison camps kyohwaso and shortterm detention facilities. The UN Security Council held an Arriaformula meeting on human rights issues in March 2023 and a formal debate in August its first discussions on human rights in North Korea since 2017. The council regularly debates and passes resolutions to address North Korea s weapons proliferation activities. Due to opposition by China and Russia the council remained unable to adopt any resolution addressing the situation. The council s separate debates on weapons proliferation in March May and June featured minimal discussion of human rights issues. The UN General Assembly was expected to pass a resolution on North Korea s human rights record in December as it has repeatedly done since 2007. South Korea strengthened its commitment to promote human rights in North Korea. The United States government maintained human rightsrelated sanctions on the North Korean government and on Kim Jong Un and several other officials. In December 2022 the European Union extended human rightsrelated sanctions on two top government officials and the country s public prosecutor s office. The EU continued to lead on bringing resolutions on North Korea at the UN General Assembly and UN Human Rights Council. Japan continued to demand the return of Japanese citizens whom North Korea abducted in the 1970s and 1980s. Some Japanese civil society groups allege the number of abductees is much higher than reported.
