For 51yearold Adrian who was born in Haiti and has lived in the U.S. for almost 20 years citizenship means one thing You not citizen you not vote. I love America Im going to become a citizen Im gonna vote she says. Mageliea Adrian is a green card holder from Haiti and has applied to become a U.S. citizen. The federal government recently changed eligibility requirements for to waive the citizenship application fee. Shannon DoolingWBURBecoming a citizen isnt easy and its about to get harder. There are numerous eligibility requirements heaps of paperwork and documents to process and a pretty hefty application fee. Adrian who currently has a green card is surprised to hear it costs more than 700 to apply for citizenship. Melanie Torres is the director of programs and operations for Bostonbased Project Citizenship which sponsors workshops like the one Adrian is attending. The nonprofits goal is to eliminate barriers to naturalization. For most of their clients Torres says the main obstacle is cost. The hardest thing is the payment so the fee not for services but just for the application itself is right now 725 Torres says. The federal government has waived fees for people who can prove they receive federal and state benefits like food stamps or Medicaid. But as of Monday thats not going to be enough. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS will now require something called a tax transcript from the IRS. Torres says obtaining this document will be nearly impossible for many of their clients. Most of our clients are transient a lot of them are elderly and dont file taxes or are claimed as dependents on other peoples taxes or live in sort of informal households so its really really hard to prove their income she says. Project Citizenship recently filed a federal lawsuit in Boston against the Trump administration. The suit challenges the waiver changes arguing it will ultimately decrease the number of eligible immigrants who are able to apply for citizenship. Nearly 40 of naturalization applications across the country included a fee waiver in 2017 according to the complaint. A spokesperson for Citizenship and Immigration Services noted in an email that the agency relies on fees to cover the costs of its operations. Fee waivers have totaled hundreds of millions of dollars a year and to balance its books USCIS says its had to raise other fees. But Torres says the Trump administrations reforms are motivated by more than fiscal concerns. We know that the election is coming up Torres says. We know that everyone is more interested right now and in 2020 were going to see a huge surge in interest and we know that this is because they dont want lowincome immigrants to vote. Jessica Vaughan heads up policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies a conservative group advocating for more restrictive immigration laws. She says the new eligibility requirements for fee waivers will spread the processing costs more evenly. Its an effort to make it more fair and there will be some additional burden on some people to show that they qualify for the fee waiver but its important that we have a system with some integrity Vaughan says. These new waiver eligibility requirements take effect Monday. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating fee waivers altogether and has also proposed hiking the current naturalization fee from 725 to 1170.

https://dailyiowan.com/2020/09/27/opinion-immigration-should-be-easier/, The current immigration process into the United States is one that causes undue amounts of stress and frustration for people trying to join in the great American project. Thomas A. Stewart Various flags are seen on Monday October 15 2018. There are 120 flags being displayed on the Iowa Memorial Union Pedestrian Bridge to recognize the international students on campus.   Zeina Aboushaar Opinions Columnist September 27 2020 The process of acquiring a citizenship in America is an emotional roller coaster and an organizational nightmare marked by endless paperwork and instructions that are deprived of any actual instructions. After fleeing Syria in 2011 my fear blossomed into hope hope that upon my arrival into the United States there would be peace and opportunities awaiting. When our plane boarded and I took my first step I felt free. I was finally able to let go of the fear that has taken over my life the fear that every breath could be my last. Little did I know that instead of being greeted with warm smiles and welcomes we would be greeted with dark interview rooms and bombarded with questions in a language that was foreign to us.  For many immigrants and prospective citizens seeking to live and work in the United States the real stumbling block comes upon their arrival when they have to obtain the green card . Every immigrant that comes to the United States has to go through a risky tedious and most importantly a costly process. Many of the immigrants come here with limited amounts of money and when they have to spend it all in order to get a job and earn the basic rights that every American has they are left with nothing.  The fees for obtaining a green card which is only the first step in acquiring citizenship run into the thousands. According to US Immigration Most immigration lawyers charge between 5000 to 8000 to simply accompany a client throughout this process not including the application fees and potential family members.  The current filing fee for the application for naturalization costs 725 per family member which adds up to an amount that not many can afford. The naturalization process fee discourages many legal residents from becoming U.S citizens.  Ever since the Trump administration came into office there has been a shift toward more severe immigration enforcement and detention tactics. Trump s immigration policies aim to appease nativists views that state that black and brown foreigners are taking American jobs. The Trump administration has introduced rules and policies such as requesting additional paperwork and tightening the scrutiny of applicants to make it harder for people to become citizens. Even before the pandemic processing rate for citizenship has been at its highest and wait times have doubled.  However the real cost is unmeasurable the uncertainty and the unknown marks a feeling of lost hope as immigrants wait for the infinite process to conclude. This neverending wait is not only distressing for immigrants but for America.  In Cedar Rapids alone the immigrant population has created a significant financial benefit worth millions of dollars for our local economy. According to The Gazette Modern neighborhoods such as the Czech Village and New Bohemia districts got their cultural roots from immigrants who moved to Cedar Rapids in the 1870s . This proves that immigrants are always willing to enable growth in a society and allows for the assimilation of valuable workforce resources.  The process of acquiring a citizenship should be easier and more welcoming especially to those people who work to help the nation prosper and grow.  Immigrants that come to America willing to work hard pay full taxes and stay out of legal trouble should have an easier pathway for them to obtain citizenship. They didn t come to America to have their opportunities drained away by the harsh process of trying to live freely in the land of the free.

Only certain immigrants are eligible those who either have been green card holders permanent residents for 3 5 years or meet various military service requirements. Citizenship is the status granted to someone born to U.S. citizens or at the end of a successful naturalization process.

The current government filing fee for naturalization citizenship applications is 845 including 760 for processing and 85 for biometrics services. Military applicants are exempt from both the application filing fee and the biometrics fee. Applicants aged 75 and older are exempt from the biometrics fee see our detailed guide to naturalization costs. USCIS also offers a 50 discount if you file your N400 online rather than by mail.  Eligibility for naturalization generally depends on a number of factors The following table summarizes the most common groups of individuals who are eligible to apply for citizenship and when they can apply followed by a more detailed explanation below  Consecutive or otherwise any period of military service counts as having physically lived in the United States.  A discharge designated GeneralUnder Honorable Conditions is considered honorable discharge for naturalization purposes.

You need not have held a green card for a certain number of years or have physically lived in the United States for any number of months prior to applying. If you ve served in the U.S. military for at least one year during peacetime you can apply while in active duty or within six months of separating honorably from the military. You need not have held a green card for a certain number of years or have physically lived in the United States for any number of months prior to applying to become a naturalized citizen.

You also must have physically lived in the United States for at least 30 months or twoandahalf years out of those five years. If you ve served in the U.S. military for at least one year during peacetime and are filing after six months of separating honorably from the military you can apply to become a United States citizen five years after obtaining your green card honorable service within this fiveyear period can count toward that required time as well. You also must have physically lived in the United States for at least 30 months twoandahalf years out of those five years. If you ve served in the U.S. military for any period during wartime you can apply anytime and need not be a green card holder. You or your military spouse must only have been physically present in the United States including U.S. territories or aboard a U.S. vessel when you enlisted reenlisted extended your service or were inducted into the military. You need not have held a green card for a certain number of years if you have one or have physically lived in the United States for any number of months prior to applying for citizenship. In addition to waiting three or five years after getting your green card unless you re applying for citizenship based on qualifying military service you must also satisfy the following requirements to proceed with the naturalization process to become a United States citizen Applicants aged 65 and older are required to study only 20 of the 100 usual questions that most applicants must prepare for. The test administrator will ask 10 of the 20 questions but the applicant will need to answer only six correctly to pass. Boundless has more details on the citizenship test exceptions. If you choose to work with Boundless and RapidVisa our dedicated team of specialists can also guide you through the English and Civics test requirements and how to prepare. Applicants with a physical or developmental disability or mental impairment may be exempt from the English and civics test requirement above. They may apply for the exemption by filing Form N648 officially called the Medical Certification for Disability Exceptions which is completed by a medical doctor. Individuals who apply for naturalization based on at least one year of peacetime military service are exempt from requirement Nos. 2 and 3 above. To meet requirement No. 4 the applicant s criminal record must be free of certain crimes at least five years before filing until they naturalize. Individuals who apply for naturalization based on any period of wartime military service are exempt from requirement Nos. 1 they may be any age 2 and 3 above. To meet requirement No. 4 the applicant s criminal record must be free of certain crimes at least one year before filing until they naturalize. Green card holders who are current or former members of the U.S. armed forces must meet additional criteria If you cannot afford the filing fee for incomebased reasons you may apply for a fee reduction or waiver. Learn more about U.S. Citizenship Requirements. The following is a brief overview of the naturalization process. Make sure to also check out our detailed guide to the U.S. citizenship timeline to help you understand when each stage of the naturalization process takes place. The first step to becoming a U.S. citizen is to file an Application for Naturalization Form N400 and pay the filing fee unless you are exempt see above for details. You may fill out and mail a paper application or complete the application online. If you file online you must first create an online account with U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services USCIS. If you re applying based on your military service from abroad or for a fee reduction or waiver you may not complete your application online. You must mail your application to the appropriate USCIS office. 90day earlyfiling rule You may submit your N400 to USCIS as early as 90 days before reaching your three or fiveyear wait period as a green card holder as long as you ve satisfied all other eligibility requirements. You must still wait the full three or five years however to become a U.S. citizen. Filing early just lets you get ahead in the application process. Our guide to the Form N400 has the full details. The next step is to set up your biometrics appointment basically getting your fingerprints taken at your local USCIS field office. As with the familybased green card process USCIS will take your fingerprints during naturalization in order to conduct a background check. The fingerprinting appointment usually takes place about a month after USCIS receives your U.S. citizenship application. The citizenship interview is usually scheduled around 14 months after filing your application. Exactly how long it will take to process your naturalization application however depends heavily on the USCIS field office handling your case which is assigned to you based on your ZIP code. During this interview a USCIS officer will verify that all of the information on your naturalization application is correct. The interview usually takes place at the nearest USCIS office. If you are applying from abroad you will attend the interview at a U.S. embassy or consulate. If you are in active military duty your interview may be held at a military facility. The citizenship interview is also referred to as a citizenship exam because at the same time the USCIS officer will also give you a twopart naturalization test unless you qualify for an exemption The first component an English language test will evaluate your written and spoken English skills. The second a civics test will assess your knowledge of U.S. history and basic information about how the U.S. government works. Check out our detailed guide to the naturalization exam which includes helpful preparation tips. But don t panic! These tests are fairly basic and USCIS provides study materials to help you prepare. You ll also have two chances to take the tests per application once during your interview and again at a later date to retake any portion that you didn t pass the first time. If you pass the interview and exam the USCIS officer will approve your application at the end of the interview. In some cases USCIS may ask you for additional documentation or schedule a second interview. If you do not pass USCIS will send you a denial letter explaining why but you may appeal their decision within 30 days of receiving the letter or reapply. A USCIS policy on denied applications taking effect on September 11 2018 underscores the importance of completing the naturalization application and meeting all requirements correctly the first time. You re almost finished! Once your application is approved you will attend an Oath of Allegiance ceremony. It s very important that you complete this step. You are not a U.S. citizen until you have taken the Oath of Allegiance. After your citizenship interview you ll receive a notice in the mail with the date time and location of the ceremony usually a local courthouse or USCIS office. The time it takes to schedule the ceremony varies by state. You ll be asked to return your green card when you check in. Once the ceremony is over you ll receive a Certificate of Naturalization and begin your life as a U.S. citizen! Once you officially receive your Certificate of Naturalization and are a U.S. citizen you ll have access to a number of benefits that were previously unavailable to you as a green card holder. In this section we ll touch on a few of these. As a green card holder you may have been able to vote in certain local municipalities but with a Certificate of Citizenship you can make an impact on the national stage by casting your vote in federal elections. To be eligible for candidacy in U.S. elections you must be a citizen which means with a Certificate of Naturalization you can run for office. Moving forward you won t need to go through the rigamarole of filing forms with USCIS. That means no more filing fees no more green card renewals or replacements and no more having to check in with the U.S. government whenever you decide you want to move. Under U.S. law only U.S. citizens may be hired to work for the U.S. government. While income levels vary federal employees are generally paid more and have greater benefits than their privatesector counterparts. As a green card holder you have limited access if any to federal programs like Social Security and Medicare. But with a Certificate of Naturalization you ll no longer face these restrictions. You can even in certain cases apply for federal college assistance which is reserved solely for U.S. citizens. Just as with any U.S. citizen you cannot be forcibly removed from the United States. This is true even if you re convicted or arrested. A naturalized citizen can only be deported if they are first stripped of their citizenship which is very rare. For this to occur the initial application must have been fraudulent in some way. With a Certificate of Naturalization you can sponsor any siblings parents or adult children who wish to apply for lawful permanent residence in the United States. Once you re naturalized your children will automatically obtain citizenship even if they re born abroad. If your child is born outside the United States be sure to notify the U.S. embassy or consulate. As a citizen of the United States you re entitled to a U.S. passport which comes with a number of benefits. For starters you ll have visafree access to over 180 countries and territories throughout the world and if while abroad you find yourself in an emergency you ll be able to contact the local U.S. consulate or embassy. You ll also have nearcomplete freedom to travel the globe as the U.S. government places no restrictions on the duration or frequency of trips abroad. Note it s always a good idea to check the specific visa requirements for any given country before making travel arrangements. Before you begin your journey toward U.S. citizenship it s important to understand the basic responsibilities of being an American citizen. Some of the most important duties include the following You may be required to renounce your citizenship in other countries. Depending on your home country s rules for dual citizenship being a citizen of two countries at the same time you may need to give up your current citizenship upon becoming an American. The United States permits dual citizenship but it requires U.S. nationals to use their U.S. passports when traveling in and out of the United States. Many countries Australia Canada and the United Kingdom for instance also allow you to be a national of another country. India Japan and a number of others however require you to relinquish your citizenship in those countries once you become an American. It s best to check your home country s policy on dual nationality before applying for naturalization if you intend to maintain your citizenship in that country. You may be called upon to serve in the military. Mandatory military service enforced by a draft was officially discontinued in 1973. If reinstated however you could be drafted to serve. Any male who is a U.S. citizen or green card holder and has lived in the United States between the ages of 18 and 25 must register with the Selective Service System. You may need to serve on a jury. In the United States jury duty in a legal proceeding is mandatory. If summoned you must attend but you may not necessarily serve. Only those who are selected by the judge and attorneys after being summoned will actually serve on the jury. Activeduty military service members professional fire and police department workers and some public government officers who serve full time in their positions are exempted from federal jury duty. Individuals who have served on a federal jury in the past two years are aged 71 and older or are volunteer first responders generally may request to be excused from service but policies vary by district court. State and local courts impose their own rules but generally also exempt individuals based on age disability or their positions in public office. You must file U.S. income tax returns for life no matter where you live. As a U.S. citizen even if you move abroad you must still file U.S. income tax returns. As long as you meet certain requirements though you ll be able to exclude from your income up to the yearly limit currently over 100000 allowed by the U.S. government meaning it won t be taxed. Any income that exceeds that limit will generally be taxed. Your criminal history will be heavily scrutinized. If you ve committed a crime that could make you deportable such as immigration fraud drug abuse or domestic violence it s especially important to seek legal assistance before applying for naturalization. Although peacetime naturalization is always an option for any applicant with at least one year of military service anyone eligible for wartime naturalization would almost certainly choose that path instead. 855 2686353 email protected Boundless is not a law firm but is affiliated with Boundless Legal a nontraditional law firm authorized by the Utah Supreme Court s Office of Legal Services Innovation to offer certain legal services in the area of immigration law.

https://immigrationlab.org/project/lifting-barriers-to-citizenship/, Taking the Oath of Allegiance at a naturalization ceremony is an emotional moment for many immigrants and for good reason it is the culmination of an often arduous process and many years of striving. Citizenship also opens a new chapter marked by possibility from better job prospects to full participation in civic life. Yet for many immigrants who aspire to become U.S. citizens that moment never arrives. Since the 1970s naturalization rates in the United States have lagged behind those of other major host countries. It s a striking disparity given that the vast majority of immigrants in the United States express interest in citizenship. And since gaining citizenship often boosts immigrants social mobility and integration the fact that so many are left behind points to a troubling loss of solidarity for their host communities. What holds them back? Why are some immigrants more likely than others to complete the naturalization process? IPL research provides the first concrete evidence of a major barrier to citizenship for lowincome immigrants. The findings help explain why citizenshippromotion efforts face significant challenges and they provide a blueprint for solutions to ensure that all immigrants have equal access to citizenship and its benefits. In seeking to understand disparities in naturalization patterns previous studies have focused on the immigrants themselves individual characteristics like language skills resources or country of origin. Here the researchers considered an external factor out of immigrants control the high costs of the citizenship application process. For many lowincome immigrants the price tag is daunting 725 just to file the application plus hundreds or even thousands more if you need English classes or consultations with immigration lawyers. Charitable organizations have stepped up to provide free language training legal advice and help navigating the paperwork. But the application fee has only become more burdensome rising by 800 percent in real terms since 1985 when it was 35 or 80.25 in today s dollars. The federal government offers a fee waiver for the poorest immigrants those with incomes below 150 of the poverty line but for many others who aren t destitute but struggle to make ends meet that fee alone can put citizenship out of reach. To address this potentially pivotal financial obstacle IPL teamed up with the New York State Office for New Americans ONA and two funders dedicated to improving the lives of vulnerable New Yorkers Robin Hood and New York Community Trust. Together we developed an innovative publicprivate program called NaturalizeNY which offers lowincome immigrants an opportunity to win a voucher covering the naturalization application fee. Veyom Bahl a managing director at Robin Hood said Robin Hood is proud to partner with the worldclass researchers at the Stanford Immigration Policy Lab. Like us they are committed to helping immigrant families build a strong footing for a new life in the United States. This research will help foundations communitybased organizations and policymakers alike rethink how we invest in our communities for maximum impact.  NaturalizeNY also connects registrants with application assistance from ONA s network of nonprofit service providers. New York s leading immigrant service organizations including CUNY Citizenship Now! Hispanic Federation and Catholic Charities were also integral in promoting and implementing the program.  This was a truly firstofakind program where a state agency philanthropies academics and nonprofits created a way to provide direct financial support to help lowincome immigrants apply for citizenship. The Immigration Policy Lab was excited to partner in its design and evaluation so everyone involved could understand its impact on immigrants and the New York community said Michael Hotard an IPL program manager. New York is home to the nation s secondlargest immigrant population and its metro area has about 160000 lowincome immigrants eligible for citizenship. With a registration website in seven languages NaturalizeNY focused on relatively poor New Yorkers who by virtue of income or lack of eligibility for government benefits like food stamps or cash assistance did not qualify for the existing federal fee waiver program. NaturalizeNY used a lottery to award the 336 available vouchers leaving 527 registrants without one. By following the two groups to see how many completed the citizenship application researchers could measure the power of financial assistance and in turn determine how much the costs may discourage others from naturalizing. The results were unequivocal the vouchers roughly doubled the application rate from 37 percent among those without a voucher to 78 percent among recipients. The vouchers proved particularly effective for those who registered in Spanish their application rate rose by 51 percent compared to a 36 percent rise among English speakers.  Because NaturalizeNY uses a lottery system to equitably distribute vouchers to eligible registrants for the first time we have clear causal evidence as to the effect of application fee vouchers on citizenship decisions. The magnitude of the effect suggests that it s a critical lever to improve lowincome immigrants access to citizenship said Jens Hainmueller a professor of political science at Stanford and IPL codirector. For the poorest immigrants however even eliminating the application cost isn t necessarily enough to pave the way toward citizenship. They may not know that they re eligible for a fee waiver or they may find the process too difficult if they re working several jobs caring for children or elderly relatives or unable to get assistance with the application. Do these kinds of disadvantages keep these immigrants from becoming citizens? To find out researchers identified 1760 immigrants who registered for NaturalizeNY but weren t entered into the lottery because they likely qualified for the federal fee waiver. While the voucher group s average annual household income was 19000 per person this group s average was just 7500. Everyone in this group received a message during registration informing them that based on their responses they likely could apply for citizenship without cost and that assistance was available. 1124 then received various nudges encouraging them to apply and to visit a local service provider for help navigating the process. These nudges mimicked the realworld interventions many groups rely on to reach immigrants in need emails phone calls text messages an official letter by regular mail and a 10 MetroCard intended to allay the cost of commuting to a service provider. Yet none of these encouragements made a significant difference in application rates beyond the 44 percent for those who received no additional encouragements. In followup surveys many participants said they had been too busy to apply. But when researchers returned to the data they found that busyness couldn t be the whole answer the nudges were just as ineffective for single people as for members of large households and for those of working age and retirement age.  That so many ended up not applying indicates that challenges to naturalization run deeper than financial constraints said Duncan Lawrence IPL executive director. It s clear that we have more to learn about what sorts of costeffective nudges may or may not work. Raising awareness of the fee waiver itself may be an important piece of the puzzle and we are actively working to understand how learning about the fee waiver affects application rates.  For policymakers looking to address social inequality and give lowincome immigrants a potential pathway to the middle class the voucher results speak volumes. The current naturalization system imposes prohibitive costs on exactly those immigrants who might stand to benefit the most from the opportunities citizenship brings. NaturalizeNY could inspire other cities and states to create similar publicprivate partnerships. ONA director Laura GonzalezMurphy emphasized the project s actionable insights saying The New York State Office for New Americans Opportunity Centers are leaders on the ground establishing strong relationships and trust with immigrants and refugees from across the world. We are always eager to eliminate barriers for these individuals and help them on their path to citizenship. Thanks to our partners including Stanford George Mason and SUNY Albany we now have a unique project to paint a real picture of the current immigration system and see where opportunities for positive change may arise.  At the federal level U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS recently lowered the fee for applicants between 150 and 200 percent of the poverty level. As this research illustrates however the financial barrier remains decisive for lowincome immigrants above that range. Expanding this tiered system with wealthier applicants paying more would allow USCIS to cover its administrative costs while keeping citizenship affordable for all. These are relatively simple projects to fund and administer and they have a potentially big longterm payoff if becoming an American citizen makes immigrants more likely to pursue higher education start a business or enter a profession then boosting naturalization rates would make for better integrated more prosperous communities.  The cost of naturalization has soared by more than 500 percent over the past three decades Rey KoslowskiUniversity at Albany SUNY Website design and development by GoodFolk

Depending on your home country s rules for dual citizenship being a citizen of two countries at the same time you may need to give up your current citizenship upon becoming an American. The United States permits dual citizenship. Many countries Australia Canada and the United Kingdom for instance also allow you to be a national of another country.

The requirements of USCIS are also very complex and may not be understandable to outsiders. Leaving your homeland and moving to a different place is not an easy decision to make. Some people criticize those of are disloyal and move abroad. But there is nothing wrong with wanting to change your life for any reason. If you wish to pursue a better future and your country isn t allowing you to do that or you need some freedoms not offered where you live moving to a foreign land is entirely okay. Sometimes it is a family member who you need to take to another country so they can get the best possible medical care.

People have always placed the United States on top of their list of the countries they could move to for several reasons. Everybody has heard about the American Dream and they all want to try their luck with it. And secondly America has always been the land of freedom a place where people can live their lives however they want free of religious and societal restrictions. The city life in New York is another attraction for outsiders. But becoming lawful permanent residents of the U.S.S. is not easy because the immigration system is so complex. An immigration attorney plays a crucial role in guiding individuals through the complex process of obtaining U.S. citizenship through naturalization. From offering legal advice on resident status to assessing eligibility for naturalization these attorneys provide essential support. They may assist clients in navigating the naturalization requirements including considerations such as armed forces service marital unions and successful completion of the twopart naturalization test. By carefully guiding applicants through the naturalization interview and ensuring compliance with legal standards immigration attorneys contribute significantly to the realization of the goal of becoming a U.S. citizen through naturalization. The naturalization application process typically initiated through Form N400 Application for Naturalization marks a significant step for individuals seeking U.S. citizenship. Understanding the form of government visa requirements and the period of time spent as a lawful permanent resident is vital in navigating this journey. Citizenship by marriage may also be a consideration and legal assistance can play a pivotal role in ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the application for citizenship. In cases of challenges or denials seeking legal support for a successful appeal is crucial underscoring the importance of comprehensive assistance throughout the entire naturalization process. Navigating the U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services requires diligence to avoid pitfalls such as immigration fraud. An experienced immigration attorney is instrumental in providing comprehensive immigration advice ensuring adherence to legal processes. From the time of birth considerations such as visa applications and sponsoring an immigrant spouse become crucial components of the journey toward citizenship. Meeting the requirements including the necessary fiveyear period is essential with documents such as the Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status requiring careful attention. Additionally compliance with legal obligations such as filing income tax returns forms an integral part of the process under the guidance of a skilled immigration attorney. When dealing with immigration matters a field office serves as a critical point of interaction. For those navigating the complexities of immigration processes a detailed guide or a comprehensive guide proves invaluable in understanding the conditions of service and requirements. In the event of challenges or denials assembling an effective Appeal Package is crucial. The USCIS Citizenship Resource Center plays a significant role in providing essential information and resources serving as a valuable tool for individuals seeking clarity and guidance throughout their immigration journey. Naturalization is how a foreign citizen foreign nationality or national is granteU.S.S. citizenship after meeting the standards set forth by Congress in the Immigration and Nationality Act I.N.A.. To become a citizen by birth you must be born in the United States or in one of the United States territories or outlying possessions that are under its control.

Citizenship and Immigration Services liaison to help you with the American citizen Form N400 application process. You will need to complete Form N400 Application for Naturalization and Form N426 Request for Military or Naval Service Certification. If you are a citizen of another nation you should contact the embassy or consulate of that country for information on its Policies and Laws. Military service is obligatory. Contact the embassy or consulate of another country for information about dual nationality dual citizenship from their perspective. You can apply while on active duty or within six months of honorably leaving the military if you ve served in the thU.S.U.S. military for at least one year. As we all know several people want to becU.S.e U.S. citizens and one can become a citizen of the country if they are born there or if their relatives or parentU.S.are U.S. citizens. The U.S. citizen parent must have legal and physical custody of the child. Parents who adopt children and want them to become citizens must have legal and physical custody of the child. A person from another country who seeks to become a citizen of the United States goes through the naturalization process first. It is not an effortless process and you cannot get citizenship through this process just by filling out forms. You will have to appear for interviews and take tests. This process will take a long time to complete. The citizenship application has to fulfill all the requirements of the constitution. It will only be approved after review. It is generally considered that while dual nationaldual citizen is in the country of which they are citizens that country has a predominant claim on them. According to the principle of jus soli the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution provides citizenship at birth to practically all individuals born in the United StateU.S. in U.S. jurisdictions. Before applying to become a naturalized citizen you do not need to have had a green card for a particular number of years or have physically lived in the United States for months. A naturalized citizen can only be deported if their citizenship is revoked first which is extremely rare. Many military installations have a designated U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services liaison to help you with the Form N400 application process. There are many requirements that people are unaware of. For instance to become a green card holder one must know basic English. They should also be aware of the history of America. Learning about the government can also be helpful. For instance those applying for immigration in 2016 were required to know the basic information about the Obama administration. The applicants of today must know about President Trump s government. They should be able to pay the application fees. All the information on their application form must be a hundred percent accurate. Some people hire an immigration lawyer to get through the citizenship process with ease. The lawyer can tell you about the constitutionU.S.f of the U.S. and which requirements you will have to fulfill to become a green cardholder. If you are an immigrant there are four primary paths to citizenship in the United States citizenship through naturalization citizenship through marriage citizenship through birth and citizenship through military service. Citizenship through naturalization is traditionally how most immigranU.S.ecome U.S. citizens. You can seek U.S. citizenship through parents marriage or naturalization depending on your immigration history. The applicant must file Form N600 Application for Certificate of Citizenship with the US government to get official proof that they obtained US citizenship through one of the aforementioned methods. The most common route is citizenship through naturalization. A passport is commonly used as an identity document and proof of citizenship protections and benefits in the United States. Generally you can apply for citizenship through naturalization when You are 18 years old or under 18 if using through parents You have been a permanent resident for five years You have been physically present in the United States for at least 30 months out of the five years immediately preceding the date of filing Form N40U.S.e the U.S. Citizen Tests Difficult? You were born in the U.S. If you were U.S.rn in a U.S. territoU.S. like the U.S. Virgin Islands Guam Puerto Rico or the Northern Mariana Islands you might be able to earn citizenship by birth even if you were. During the biometrics appointment most citizenship applicants will be required to take a photograph produce an electronic signature and submit fingerprints. The information is needed to do a background check and confirm who you claim to be. You will receive a letter after your biometrics appointment with the time and date of your citizenship interview. The USCIS will collect personal information about you during a biometrics appointment. After your citizenship interview you ll receive a notice in the mail with the date time and location of the ceremony usually a local courthouse or USCIS office. You can sponsor any siblings parents or adult children who want to apply for lawful permanent residence and continuous residence in the United States with a Certificate of Naturalization. Even if you U.S. born in a U.S. territory you cannot gain citizenship through birth if your parents are members of a sovereign Native American tribe or foreign diplomats. If you don t have an immediate familyU.S.ember in the U.S. you can t change that. But there are other things you can switch to become an eligible immigrant. YU.S. can learn the U.S. constitution and familiarize yourself with the workings of the American government. It is better to follow the legal course. If you become an unauthorized immigrant you can say goodbye to your dream of becoming a green cardholder. You should be able to give up on your national origin if yoU.S.want to join the U.S. legal permanent residents. For instance if you are from India you should be willing to place America over your homeland. If you are worried about the citizenship test hiring an immigration lawyer can help. They can tell you everything about the federal government s regulations. Thanks to their professional experience they can provide you with the right tips. For instance you may not know that political opinions should not be shared during your immigration interview. But your lawyer can prepare you for the interview properly. It is important to remember that it can be challenging to become an immigrant if you are from a specific background. For instance people from Mexico and the Middle East may not be ablU.S. get through the U.S. citizenship process quickly. It is essential to develop a basic understanding of the American culture before you take the oath of citizenship. It isn t just about fulfilling the legal requirements before taking your oath of citizenship. You have to be familiar with the U.S.way of life in the U.S. if you wish to become a part of it. Although the process isn t easy for the people of Mexico it isn t impossible. Many citizens of Mexico have successfU.S.ly immigrated to the U.S. over the year. As long as you fulfill all the requirements and submit a certified translation of your birth certificate and citizenship certificate you will havU.S.a a chance at becoming a U.S. citizen. Whether you are a citizen of China or an African country the eligibility criteria will remain the same. If you want to get U.S.Citizenship then you should not ignore the requirements. It is the only way of attaining citizen status. No one wants to leave their home country. Whether you are from the Philippines or India you wouldn t want to leave behind the people who understand your language and your culture. However sometimes there is no other option than to go even if you can t take a family member with you. AsU.S.e mentioned to become a U.S. citizen you have to apply for the naturalization process but first you have to make sure that you are eligible for this process. You can start by learning about the eligibility requirements. If you don t fulfill all the eligibility requirements you will have to work on them first before sending in your application. You can learn about the conditions on the website of USCIS. After you file your naturalization applications to USCIS you will be notified about your U.S. citizenship interview and test. If you fail in this test you will be allowed to retake the test but if you fail again you must start the whole citizenship application process. And if you clear the test and interview you will be invited for a citizenship ceremony and will take the Oath of Allegiance. Upon completing the naturalization ceremony you will become an American citizen. After three to five years in the U.S.A. Green Cardholders have the opportunity to become true Americans. In most cases this is advisable as American citizenship comeU.S.with some additional rights. U.S. citizens enjoy the following advantages over Green Cardholders The chances to become a United States citizen depend mainly on how tricky it is for you first to become a permanent resident and get a green card. If you re highly educated and can find work you can expect to obtain citizenship after becoming a green card owner in just over five years. If you marry a citizen you can apply for a green card and get citizenship in only three years. In any case lawful permanent residents are the only ones who can join the nation of the United States as a citizen. Though you are less educated or unable to find work there s often no precise method of joining the lawful permanent residents living in the U.S. In the worst case you have little education and no way of getting a supporting employer. In this case the choice is to either stay out or stay unlawfully. That is not a good choice for you. Possibility of Sponsoring Family Members Seeking Immigration Status You can sponsor any siblings parents or adult children who want to apply for lawful permanent residence in the United States with a Certificate of Naturalization. You may have been eligible to vote in select local towns as a green cardholder. Still now that you have a Certificate of Citizenship you can affect the national stage by voting in federal elections. As you have rightly estimated the lengthy process of attaining citizen status is quite deadly and drawn out. The most challenging part is finding an employer willing to work with a candidate right through thU.S.ole process. In addition the U.S. Government sets limits on the number of green cards approved per year and you get an immigration process that is difficult to find a way for even those that are best equipped to do so. The immigration law also keeps changing so it is essential to keep an eye out on the proceedings of Congress. USCIS has a list of requirements for everyone that wishes to apply for citizenship. It is essential to remember that rules are different for asylum seekers. Here are the basic needs So how hard is it to become a U.S. citizen? We would advise that any naturalborn U.S. citizen understand this process if only to have a better understanding of what it takes for skilled people to get through the system. Unfortunately it is almost not viable for an uneducated or a lowskilled worker to be granted a visa or be eligible to apply for citizenship. The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services USCIS outlines specific criteria for granting citizenship to children born to a citizen parent and a foreign national. Among these criteria the continuous residence requirement plays a crucial role ensuring that the citizen parent has spent a significant period in the U.S. before the child s birth. This policy aims to establish a tangible link between the citizen parent and the United States. For children born outside the country of birth of the citizen parent proof of citizenship must be meticulously documented including evidence of the parent s U.S. residency. Additionally the backgrounds of parents including any criminal records or service in the armed forces are thoroughly reviewed to assess the eligibility for citizenship. This rigorous process underscores the importance of transparency and adherence to legal standards safeguarding the integrity of citizenship proceedings and the responsibilities of public government officers in these determinations. Immigration fraud poses a significant threat to the integrity of the democratic process particularly when individuals from a foreign country attempt to circumvent visa requirements or misrepresent the validity of a marital union to gain favor in a successful appeal with U.S. Citizenship and Naturalization Services. Citizenship applicants must navigate a complex landscape of legal expectations including military service requirements for those who seek naturalization through honorable service or specific roles such as police department workers. Each step towards obtaining a naturalization certificate demands adherence to the highest standards of honesty and integrity. The system is designed to ensure that those who wish to become part of the U.S. fabric meet not only the formal criteria but also embody the values that uphold the nation s democratic principles. This rigorous vetting process underscores the importance of transparency and accountability in maintaining the sanctity of citizenship and naturalization safeguarding the nation against fraud while honoring the contributions of genuine applicants.

https://www.bushcenter.org/publications/citizenship-matters-encouraging-immigrants-to-become-americans/,  Welcome to The Struggle for Freedom a monthly series about democracy and human rights activists abroad and why supporting them is the right thing for Americans to do strategically as well as morally.   A Journal Of Ideas From The Bush Institute   The Strategerist podcast highlights compassion and optimism through conversation with newsmakers leaders and people working to change the world.   Naturalization is not just about the immigrants. It is about the contributions and vitality the United States gains each time an immigrant becomes a citizen.  Download the whitepaper PDF  When U.S. immigration policy is at its best it creates new Americans eager to contribute to our great country strengthens our democracy and fills critical gaps in the labor force making us more competitive in the global economy. But we have lost sight of that in recent years branding immigrants a drain on our society and increasing roadblocks along the path to citizenship. The truth is immigrants punch above their weight in economic terms. They enhance our communities. And they have been enriching American culture for our entire history. They are our neighbors and essential workers our doctors innovators meatpackers and farm workers. It is to their advantage and the nation s that they become citizens. Nearly 9 million permanent residents are eligible to apply for citizenship each year and around 700000 have done so annually since 2000. Many of them wait months to take the oath of citizenship after applying for naturalization. The COVID19 pandemic and ensuing shutdowns have exacerbated this backlog and increased wait times significantly. It is in the best interest of the United States local communities and businesses to promote naturalization and support immigrants on their journey to citizenship. Immigrants are an economic force for the United States. Entrepreneurially and innovatively they have made their mark on our country for decades. Immigrants comprise less than 14 of our population but make up 17 of the U.S. labor force. They start businesses at twice the rate of the nativeborn population and they and their children founded 45 of the companies in the Fortune 500 in 2019. Immigrants are twice as likely to be granted patents than nativeborn Americans. Some of our bestknown tech companies were founded by immigrants including eBay Google Tesla and Yahoo. Immigrants have contributed to American culture since its founding. So many things that are quintessentially American were brought to the United States from all corners of the world. Americans have an endless capacity to adopt our new residents foods and customs as our own enriching our daily lives. Immigrants and their children have been influential in nearly every aspect of our culture from the arts to science to sports. One of America s most famous architects I.M. Pei was a Chinese immigrant. American ballet would not be as important as it is today without Russianborn George Balanchine. Our movie and television industries have been blessed with immigrant talent for decades from people like Frank Capra who directed It s a Wonderful Life to actors Charlize Theron Sofia Vergara Mila Kunis Kumail Nanjiani Michael J. Fox and Jim Carrey among countless others. There are many influential immigrant designers in American fashion Diane von Furstenberg Oscar de la Renta Carolina Herrera Jason Wu Joseph Altuzarra and Prabal Gurung to name just a few. Immigrants have risen to the highest levels of many sports in the U.S. Notable athletes include Dirk Nowitzki Annika Sorenstam Albert Pujols Monica Seles Ezekiel Ansah David Feherty Dikembe Mutombo Hakeem Olajuwon Patrick Ewing Mariano Rivera Yasiel Puig Felix Hernandez and Sammy Sosa. We see immigrants impacting American journalism as well. Jorge Ramos Arianna Huffington and Fareed Immigrants who have positively impacted American science are too numerous to count. Examples include such noteworthy scientists as Albert Einstein and Alexander Graham Bell. Perhaps one of the most influential immigrants in our history was Andrew Carnegie. Born in Scotland he came to the United States as a child and eventually became one of the wealthiest people in America. He later become a prominent philanthropist1 helping establish thousands of public libraries in the United States. Immigrants especially naturalized citizens choose to be Americans. They choose our democracy our freedoms and our culture. It should come as no surprise then that immigrants are as patriotic or more patriotic than nativeborn Americans. To measure this Alex Nowrasteh and Andrew C. Forrester of the Cato Institute analyzed responses to the General Social Survey. Immigrants overall were prouder of the United States than nativeborn Americans were. They are more likely to believe that the United States treats all groups equally than their nativeborn counterparts. They are less ashamed of the United States than the native born by a large margin. And more immigrants than nativeborn Americans think the world would be better if citizens of other countries were more American. Immigrants patriotic feelings about America are not the entire story however. The General Social Survey also found that immigrants trust American institutions such as Congress the Supreme Court and the presidency at much higher rates than nativeborn Americans do. Immigrants are injecting muchneeded support for these institutions. Confidence in U.S. democratic institutions has been on the decline for several years. It is notable that immigrants who chose the United States have such a positive outlook on our government particularly when the nativeborn attitudes are trending negatively. Immigrants have also been key to the U.S. fight against COVID19. Nearly 30 of physicians in the U.S. are foreign born as are more than 15 of registered nurses. The current pandemic has also spotlighted workers we do not think about enough grocery store stockers and clerks delivery drivers truck drivers agricultural workers meatplant workers and other personnel providing essential services. Immigrants tend to be overrepresented in these professions too Nearly 17 of grocerystore workers 18 of fooddelivery drivers and 19 of truck drivers are foreign born. Additionally almost a third of meatprocessing plant workers were born outside the United States and many of the men and women working at these jobs are refugees. The fruits and vegetables keeping us nourished during the pandemic are picked almost entirely by immigrants who are in the country without legal authorization who have no path to citizenship under U.S. immigration law. More than 70 of farm workers are undocumented. Indeed many of the services we use to keep us connected and safe during the pandemic were started by immigrants. Zoom and Postmates are just two examples. Even the N95 mask one of the most important tools frontline health workers have when treating COVID19 patients was invented by Taiwanese immigrant Peter Tsai. Immigrants are incredibly important to American society. But they cannot fully participate in American civic life and in our economy if they do not naturalize. Naturalized citizens and lawful permanent residents LPRs also known as green card holders make up nearly three quarters of immigrants in the United States. Advantages accrue to immigrants who become American citizens making the immigrant population that is eligible to naturalize an untapped resource for America. Immigrants who become naturalized citizens see their earnings increase by 8 to 11 with a gain of a little over 5 in the first two years after they become Americans according to a 2012 study from Manuel Pastor and Justin Scoggins at the University of Southern California s Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration. New Americans earnings continue to grow in subsequent years although the rate does slow over time. The economic benefit extends beyond the individuals and their families to the entire U.S. economy. Pastor and Scoggins estimated that if the immigrants eligible for naturalization in 2012 became citizens their cumulative earnings would have poured 21 billion to 45 billion into the economy. That s billions of extra dollars being spent at local businesses invested in children s education and used as a down payments on homes or seed money to start businesses. Given the joint economic benefit both to the new citizen and to the U.S. economy Americans should encourage eligible immigrants to become citizens. Perhaps more important than the economic benefits are the social benefits that accrue when immigrants naturalize. Citizenship comes with certain rights and responsibilities that lawful permanent residents do not have including the right to vote the opportunity to serve on a jury and the ability to run for public office. Citizenship allows immigrants to more fully invest in American democracy and our future strengthening our society. The act of naturalization after all is about committing to America and our shared ideals. Choosing to permanently become an American is not a light decision. Immigrants who wish to become American citizens must have been lawfully present in the U.S. for three to five years have had a continuous presence in the United States have a clean criminal record pass English and civics exams and pass interviews with USCIS officials. The oath of citizenship requires new citizens to renounce their allegiance to their home countries. It requires new citizens to commit to defending the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. In many cases naturalized citizens must give up certain rights in their home countries. Yet many immigrants continue to judge the benefits of U.S. citizenship as greater than the losses they may incur. They recognize that citizenship is a social and economic equalizer and they are committed to full participation in the American experience. Once immigrants become citizens they are quick to assimilate and integrate in American society. In a 2019 report for The Center for Migration Studies Donald Kerwin and Robert Warren found that naturalized citizens have similar or higher levels of educational attainment and employment than nativeborn citizens. New Americans work in skilled professions about as often as those born here and their income is the same or higher. They are thriving in America and citizenship through naturalization simply cements their successfulintegration. The steepest barriers to naturalization are often cost and a lack of mastery of the English language. Many immigrants also find it difficult to make the time commitment to go through the naturalization process. To apply for citizenship immigrants must attend several interviews at a USCIS field office most likely requiring time off from work. Immigrants also must find the time to study for their citizenship exams tests of reading writing and history which can be difficult given work schedules and family commitments. American immigration law is complex and the stakes are too high for immigrants to forego hiring an attorney to shepherd them through the process. This imposes yet another cost to becoming a citizen. As if the natural barriers to naturalization were not enough USCIS has recently increased administrative barriers. The Migration Policy Institute MPI issued a report in 2020 detailing some of the bureaucratic hurdles implemented in recent years many of which stem from more rigorous vetting to root out fraud. After reviewing survey data from the Immigrant Legal Resource Center MPI found that USCIS was conducting lengthier interviews in some cases twice as long as before. USCIS also issued more requests for evidence on applications than usual administered the civics and English exams more strictly and in some cases asked very detailed questions not related to applicants eligibility for citizenship. At least a quarter of the survey respondents reported that applicants missed interviews because notices were sent too late to wrong addresses or to attorneys rather than applicants. We do not know whether these applicants citizenship journeys were delayed due to incompetence or due to deliberate administrative chicanery. These policy changes have done nothing to reduce the rate of acceptance of naturalization applications. As MPI notes in its report the approval rate has been relatively stable at around 90. Rigorous vetting is not itself problematic but it does not benefit anyone when it does not ultimately change the outcome just delays it. We all benefit when fully assimilating immigrants. Delaying naturalization delays those benefits. Immigrants encounter many barriers on the path to citizenship. USCIS should take a hard look at how it administers naturalization and the barriers it puts in place. And our businesses and communities can offer support to make overcoming those barriers more likely. Given the benefits of citizenship outlined in this paper it should be in the interest of the U.S. federal government including USCIS to find ways to reduce barriers to naturalization. Keeping naturalization fees reasonable is an excellent first step. As an agency funded almost entirely by the fees it charges for the services it provides USCIS must raise fees on occasion to continue to fund the agency. But it should only do so with an eye on maintaining the services it provides and should not raise them by more than is necessary. USCIS should also ensure fee waivers continue to exist for those who struggle to afford their citizenship applications. Poorer immigrants are less likely to naturalize so fee waivers eliminate one of the highest barriers to obtaining citizenship for these immigrants. Finally the naturalization application procedure and accompanying rules should be evaluated to ensure that increased vetting and limitations on accelerated processing are effective at catching fraud rather than just slowing down naturalization. A robust modern U.S. immigration policy should encourage naturalization for those immigrants eligible for it. This can be facilitated from the ground up starting with nongovernmental organizations faithbased organizations and local communities working with immigrants to help them navigate the steps required to naturalize. A great example of this work at the community level is programming from the City of Dallas s Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs WCIA. Cities like Dallas have little authority when it comes to changing the legal structures of the immigration system but the Dallas WCIA has constructed a plan to make the Dallas community more welcoming to immigrants. Among other activities the WCIA created a citywide citizenship campaign to promote awareness about the benefits and responsibilities of U.S. citizenship. The city proactively works with community organizations to offer free naturalization application workshops. City libraries have resources to educate everyone about citizenship and civic engagement. Finally the city connects immigrants to other residents via volunteer opportunities in an initiative sure to strengthen the entire community. The business community too has a role to play in promoting naturalization. Employers can make naturalization more attainable for eligible immigrants by creating policies that support immigrant employees through the many steps in the process. Applicants must find time to study for the citizenship exam and attend multiple interviews. Once approved immigrants often must take time off work to take their oaths of citizenship. Employers who can provide flexibility and affirmative encouragement during this process can contribute positively to their employees citizenship journey. Some companies are already taking steps to support their immigrant employees. For example Walmart not only provides opportunities for its associates to take English language classes but also partners with the National Immigration Forum to provide access to an online portal that helps associates explore their legal immigration options. This is an excellent example of how employers can use corporate policies to help their immigrant employees integrate faster and thrive in the United States. Naturalization is not just about the immigrants. It is about the contributions and vitality the United States gains each time an immigrant becomes a citizen. It is about the social cohesion we gain when we can eliminate the barriers between immigrants and the native born We are all equal as American citizens with an equal voice equal protection of the laws and an equal stake in the success of the community. The United States should make it a priority to encourage immigrants to become Americans. Our policies at all levels of government and across the private sector should encourage eligible immigrants to become naturalized citizens. Immigrants reach their full potential when they become fully integrated into American society. All of us can work together to welcome immigrants and help them become Americans.  1 The Carnegie Corporation of New York is a generous supporter of the Bush Institute s immigration policy work.

While green card holders can live and work in the United States and enjoy most of the same benefits as a U.S. citizen permanent residents are not U.S. citizens and because of that do not enjoy the same benefits as citizens.

Images The most common way to become a U.S. citizen is through the process of naturalization. To qualify an applicant must However naturalization is not the only way someone can become a U.S. citizen. In fact there are four types of citizenship. If you are a green card holder you can apply for U.S. citizenship five years after getting your green card. You also must have been physically present in the United States for at twoandahalf years of those five years. There is only one exception. The spouse of a U.S. citizen residing in the United States must have only continuously resided in the United States as an landed permanent resident for at least three years immediately preceding the date of the filing the application. In this case the spouse must also show that he or she has been physically present in the U.S. for at least one and a half of those three years. It is hard because of the long processing times the financial and personal costs involved and the fact that most immigrants do not have a direct relative that is a citizen of the United States. The requirements of U.S. citizenship are also complex and may not be understandable to some immigrants. The current naturalization fee for a U.S. citizenship application is 725. That total includes 640 for application processing and 85 for biometrics services both of which are nonrefundable regardless of whether the U.S. government approves or rejects an application. If you hire an attorney to help you the attorney s fee will be on top of these amounts. There is no such thing as U.S. Citizenship by investment. However after getting a green card via the EB5 foreign investor visa route applicants can naturalize. Dual citizenship is allowed in the USA. Yes. The U.S. government does not require naturalized U.S. citizens to relinquish citizenship in their country of origin. The main disadvantage is you become liable for U.S. tax on your worldwide income even if you leave the U.S. Unlike most other countries U.S. citizens pay tax on their worldwide income regardless of where they are living. So if you move to Canada for the rest of your life for example you are still required to pay U.S. taxes including estate taxes on death. Hopefully this overview will enable you to better understand most of the rules governing U.S. citizenship. If you still have questions it is advisable to consult a U.S. immigration attorney to get more detailed answers.
