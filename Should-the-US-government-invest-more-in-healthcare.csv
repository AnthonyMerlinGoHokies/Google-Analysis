https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2021-05-26-fact-sheet-federal-investment-needed-keep-hospitals-physical-infrastructure, To deliver the safe timely and effective care that Americans depend upon hospitals health systems behavioral health and postacute care providers continually maintain over 6000 hospitals nearly 920000 hospital beds and thousands more clinics. This physical infrastructure also relies on a vast array of complex and costly mechanical systems information technology medical equipment and other supplies. America s hospital infrastructure also must be prepared to function under a daunting array of circumstances. From routine care and medical emergencies to pandemics and natural disasters hospitals must operate 24 hours per day 7 days per week. In doing so they also must meet federally mandated quality and safety standards that continually evolve to keep up with advances in clinical practice. However America s hospital infrastructure is at an inflection point. Hospitals are highly vulnerable to rapidly emerging challenges including aging physical plant severely deteriorated hospital finances new quality standards and advances in diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. While hospitals are doing everything within their ability to respond the scope scale and urgency of these challenges means they cannot adequately maintain and upgrade the hospital infrastructure Americans need and deserve without federal financial support. The federal government has a history of providing dedicated funding for the modernization of America s hospital infrastructure. For over 50 years from 19461997 the HillBurton Act provided hospitals and other health care facilities with access to grants and loans for facility construction and modernization. Many hospitals need support so they can update their facilities and remain an access point to care in their communities especially those hospitals serving medically underserved populations. In addition investments in hospital infrastructure also are investments in the people and communities they serve. Hospitals and health systems often are economic anchors supporting 1outof9 jobs in the U.S. and over 1 trillion in purchases of goods and services from others in their community. Moreover COVID19 has revealed that our health care infrastructure was underresourced for a pandemic. Many hospitals and health systems were financially challenged headed into the crisis and now are experiencing unprecedented financial losses. Nearly four dozen hospitals have closed or declared bankruptcy in the past year. Furthermore continual cost pressures have left hospitals with very little excess capacity which became apparent during surges in COVID19 that resulted in scarce inpatient and ICU beds. Now is the time to invest in our health care infrastructure to ensure we will be fully equipped for any future public health emergency whether it be a new virus a mass shooting or a natural disaster. Finally given the increase in extreme weather events including floods fires and hurricanes now also is the time to assist hospitals in making modifications to their facilities to ensure they can remain resilient and deliver care to their communities. The AHA urges Congress and the Biden Administration to prioritize funding for America s hospital infrastructure. These investments are critical to ensuring the longterm sustainability and viability of hospitals and maintaining access to high quality safe and environmentally sustainable health care.

January 30 2020  triangle icon Illustration by Gracia Lam   Illustration by Gracia Lam   The U.S. spends more on health care than any other highincome country but has the lowest life expectancy   The U.S. has the highest suicide rate among wealthy nations   The U.S. spends more on health care than any other highincome country but has the lowest life expectancy   The U.S. has the highest suicide rate among wealthy nations  A 2015 Commonwealth Fund brief showed that before the major provisions of the Affordable Care Act were introduced the United States had worse outcomes and spent more on health care largely because of greater use of medical technology and higher prices compared to other highincome countries.1 By benchmarking the performance of the U.S. health care system against other countries and updating with new data as they become available we can gain important insights into our strengths and weaknesses and help policymakers and delivery system leaders identify areas for improvement. This analysis is the latest in a series of Commonwealth Fund crossnational comparisons that uses health data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD to assess U.S. health care system spending outcomes risk factors and prevention utilization and quality relative to 10 other highincome countries Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Sweden Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We also compare U.S. performance to that of the OECD average comprising 36 highincome member countries. In 2018 the U.S. spent 16.9 percent of gross domestic product GDP on health care nearly twice as much as the average OECD country. The secondhighest ranking country Switzerland spent 12.2 percent. At the other end of the spectrum New Zealand and Australia devote only 9.3 percent approximately half as much as the U.S. does. The share of the economy spent on health care has been steadily increasing since the 1980s for all countries because health spending growth has outpaced economic growth2 in part because of advances in medical technologies rising prices in the health sector and increased demand for services.3 Per capita health spending in the U.S. exceeded 10000 more than two times higher than in Australia France Canada New Zealand and the U.K. Public spending including governmental spending social health insurance and compulsory private insurance is comparable in the U.S. and many of the other nations and constitutes the largest source of health care spending. In the U.S. percapita spending from private sources for instance voluntary spending on private health insurance premiums including employersponsored health insurance coverage is higher than in any of the countries compared here. At 4092 per capita U.S. private spending is more than five times higher than Canada the secondhighest spender. In Sweden and Norway private spending made up less than 100 per capita. As a share of total spending private spending is much larger in the U.S. 40 than in any other country 0.3 15. The average U.S. resident paid 1122 outofpocket for health care which includes expenses like copayments for doctor s visits and prescription drugs or health insurance deductibles. Only the Swiss pay more residents of France and New Zealand pay less than half of what Americans spend. Despite the highest spending Americans experience worse health outcomes than their international peers. For example life expectancy at birth in the U.S. was 78.6 years in 2017 more than two years lower than the OECD average and five years lower than Switzerland which has the longest lifespan. In the U.S. life expectancy masks racial and ethnic disparities. Average life expectancy among nonHispanic black Americans 75.3 years is 3.5 years lower than for nonHispanic whites 78.8 years.4 Life expectancy for Hispanic Americans 81.8 years is higher than for whites and similar to that in Netherlands New Zealand and Canada. Reflecting shorter life expectancy the U.S. has the highest suicide rate of these countries with France a close second. Meanwhile the U.K. has the lowest rate half that of the U.S. Elevated suicide rates may indicate a high burden of mental illness socioeconomic variables are also a factor.5 The U.S. has seen an uptick in deaths of despair in recent years which include suicides and deaths related to substance use including overdoses.6 Worse health outcomes and shorter life expectancy appear related to risk factors and disease burden. More than onequarter of U.S. adults report they have ever been diagnosed with two or more chronic conditions such as asthma diabetes heart disease or hypertension during their lifetime compared to 22 percent or less in all other countries. This rate is twice as high as in the Netherlands and the U.K. Obesity is a key risk factor for chronic conditions such as diabetes hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases and cancer. The U.S. has the highest obesity rate among the countries studied two times higher than the OECD average and approximately four times higher than in Switzerland and Norway. Overall obesity rates were highest in Englishspeaking countries all with rates of onequarter or more of the total population. Issues that contribute to obesity include unhealthy living environments lessregulated food and agriculture industries and socioeconomic and behavioral factors.7 Despite having the highest level of health care spending Americans had fewer physician visits than their peers in most countries. At four visits per capita per year Americans visit the doctor at half the rate as do Germans and the Dutch. The U.S. rate was comparable to that in New Zealand Switzerland and Norway but higher than in Sweden. Lessfrequent physician visits may be related to the low supply of physicians in the U.S. compared with the other countries. The U.S. has slightly more than half as many physicians as Norway which has the highest supply. The average length of a hospital stay in the U.S. in 2017 was 5.5 days far lower than the OECD average and comparable to that in Sweden Switzerland and France. Canadians and Germans had the longest lengths of stay while Australians had the shortest. U.S. utilization for specialized scans is higher than in most countries nearly twice as high as the OECD average but comparable to France. Germany had an even higher magnetic resonance imaging MRI rate while New Zealand s was low. Previous analyses suggest that countries with a high supply of MRI scanners also tend to have higher rates of scan utilization.8 The U.S. performs some elective surgeries at a higher rate than other countries. The U.S. rate of hip replacements per 1000 persons age 65 and older was higher than the OECD average but similar to the rate in Norway and Switzerland. Canada the U.K. and New Zealand had the lowest rates with rates close to the OECD average. The U.S. outperforms peer nations in terms of preventive measures. In the U.S. more than twothirds of adults 65 and older had a flu vaccine in 2016 considerably more than in the average OECD country. Only the U.K. had a higher rate than the U.S. At the lower end of the spectrum onethird of older adults in Germany and Norway received the vaccine. The U.S. also had one of the highest rates of women ages 50 to 69 being screened for breast cancer. The U.S. rate is considerably higher than the OECD average. In contrast in Switzerland France and Germany only half of women this age had been screened. The fiveyear survival rate for breast cancer is the highest in the U.S. among the 11 countries it is more than 5 percentage points higher than the OECD average. Breast cancer survival rates in all 11 countries compared here are higher than the OECD average. This is not true for other types of cancer. For example fiveyear survival for cervical cancer among U.S. women is lower than in the 10 other countries and below the OECD average. Hospitalizations for diabetes and hypertension which are considered ambulatory care sensitive conditions meaning they are considered preventable with access to better primary care9 were approximately 50 percent higher in the U.S. than the OECD average. Only Germany had higher rates for both conditions. The U.S. rate of hypertensionrelated hospitalizations was more than eightfold higher than the bestperforming countries the Netherlands the U.K. and Canada. For diabetes hospitalizations the U.S. rate 204100000 was more than threefold higher than the Netherlands the bestperforming country. Premature deaths from conditions that are considered preventable with timely access to effective and quality health care10 including diabetes hypertensive diseases and certain cancers are termed mortality amenable to health care. This indicator is used by several countries to measure health system performance.11 The U.S. has the highest rates of amenable mortality among the 11 countries with 112 deaths for every 100000. It is notable that the amenable mortality rate has dropped considerably since 2000 for every country in our analysis though less proportionately in the U.S. The U.S. rate was two times higher than in Switzerland France Norway and Australia. This poor performance suggests the U.S. has worse access to primary care prevention and chronic disease management compared to peer nations. While the United States spends more on health care than any other country we are not achieving comparable performance. We have poor health outcomes including low life expectancy and high suicide rates compared to our peer nations. A relatively higher chronic disease burden and incidence of obesity contribute to the problem but the U.S. health care system is also not doing its part. Our analysis shows that the U.S. has the highest rates of avoidable mortality because of people not receiving timely highquality care. The findings from this analysis point to key policy implications as well as opportunities to learn from other countries. First greater attention should be placed on reducing health care costs. The U.S. could look to approaches taken by other industrialized nations to contain costs12 including budgeting practices and using valuebased pricing of new medical technologies. Approaches that aim to lower health care prices are likely to have the greatest impact since previous research has indicated that higher prices are the primary reason why the U.S. spends more on health care than any other country.13 Second our findings call for addressing risk factors for and better management of chronic conditions. We can start by strengthening access to care and primary care systems. Our findings show that the U.S. has a relatively lower rate of physician visits compared to other nations. This is surprising given U.S. adults seemingly greater health needs. We do know from previous Commonwealth Fund surveys that adults in the U.S. experience greater affordability barriers to accessing physician visits tests and treatments.14 Increasing access to affordable health care and strengthening primary care systems are two of the most important challenges for the U.S. health care system.15 Third the U.S. should promote incentives to use effective care and disincentives to discourage lesseffective care. For example a recent analysis estimated that as much as onequarter of total health care spending in the U.S. between 760 billion and 935 billion annually is wasteful.16 Overtreatment or lowvalue care medications tests treatments and procedures that provide no or minimal benefit or potential harm accounts for approximately onetenth of this spending. The U.S. can learn from other countries for example our comparably high use of MRI scans and surgeries for hip replacement suggests we should assess when these interventions bring the greatest value. The global Choosing Wisely campaign promotes conversations around evidencebased care between physicians and their patients to help evaluate which tests and treatments are truly necessary and free from harm.17 In sum the U.S. health care system is the most expensive in the world but Americans continue to live relatively unhealthier and shorter lives than peers in other highincome countries. Efforts to rein in costs improve affordability and access to needed care coupled with greater efforts to address risk factors are required to alleviate the problem. This analysis used data from the 2019 release of health statistics compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD which tracks and reports on a wide range of health system measures across 36 highincome countries. Data were extracted between July and August 2019. While data collected by the OECD reflect the gold standard in international comparisons one limitation is that data may mask differences in how countries collect their health data. Full details on how indicators were defined as well as countrylevel differences in definitions are available from the OECD.18 The 10 comparator countries included in this comparison represent those that take part in the Commonwealth Fund s annual International Health Policy Survey Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Sweden Switzerland and the United Kingdom.19 The authors wish to thank Corinne Lewis and Jesse Baumgartner for their careful data check.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-read/2017/01/13/more-americans-say-government-should-ensure-health-care-coverage/, Currently 60 of Americans say the government should be responsible for ensuring health care coverage for all Americans compared with 38 who say this should not be the government s responsibility. The share saying it is the government s responsibility has increased from 51 last year and now stands at its highest point in nearly a decade. Just as there are wide differences between Republicans and Democrats about the 2010 health care law the survey also finds partisan differences in views on whether it s the government s responsibility to make sure all Americans have health care coverage. More than eightinten Democrats and Democraticleaning independents 85 say the federal government should be responsible for health care coverage compared with just 32 of Republicans and Republican leaners.  The survey also finds continued differences on this question by race and ethnicity as well as income. A large majority of blacks and Hispanics 85 and 84 respectively say the government should be responsible for coverage while nonHispanic whites are split on the issue 49 agree 49 disagree. And while about threequarters of those with family incomes of less than 30000 per year 74 say the government should ensure coverage only about half 53 of those with incomes of 75000 or higher say the same. The belief that the government has a responsibility to ensure health coverage has increased across many groups over the past year but the rise has been particularly striking among lower and middleincome Republicans. Currently 52 of Republicans with family incomes below 30000 say the federal government has a responsibility to ensure health coverage for all up from just 31 last year. There also has been a 20percentagepoint increase among Republicans with incomes of 3000074999 34 now 14 last year. But there has been no significant change among those with incomes of 75000 or more 18 now 16 then. Those who think government should ensure health coverage for all are divided on a followup question about whether health insurance should be provided through a mix of private insurance companies and the government 29 of the overall public or if the government alone should provide insurance 28 of the public. Overall 43 of Democrats and Democratic leaners support a socalled single payer approach but this approach is more popular among liberal Democrats 51 than among conservative and moderate Democrats 38. Most of those on the other side of the issue people who say the government does not have a responsibility to ensure health coverage say on a subsequent question that the government should continue Medicare and Medicaid 32 of the overall public while just 5 of the public says the government should have no role in health care. Among Republicans and Republican leaners most of whom 67 say the government does not have a responsibility for ensuring health coverage there is very little support for the government not being involved in health care at all. Just 10 of Republicans favor no government involvement while 56 say it should continue Medicare and Medicaid. While Republicans in Congress have already taken the first steps toward repealing the ACA Americans remain largely divided on what Congress should do with the health care law. Overall in a Pew Research Center survey in December 39 said it should be repealed while an equal share 39 said the law should be expanded. Just 15 of Americans said the law should be left as is. Although the public is divided on the future of the law there is bipartisan support for a number of ACA provisions. Regardless of their personal views of the law a small majority 53 expects its major provisions will likely be eliminated. A December Kaiser Family Foundation survey shows repealing the law is not the public s top health care priority for Presidentelect Donald Trump and the next Congress. Lowering the amount individuals pay for health care tops the list with 67 of Americans saying it should be a top priority for the next administration. This is followed by lowering the cost of prescription drugs 61 and dealing with the prescriptionpainkiller addiction epidemic 45. Only 37 of the public says repealing the law should be the administration s top priority though views differ widely by party. Note Survey topline is available here PDF. Methodology can be found here.

https://www.pgpf.org/blog/2024/01/why-are-americans-paying-more-for-healthcare,  The United States spends significantly more on healthcare compared to other nations but does not have better healthcare outcomes. What s more rising healthcare spending is a key driver of America s unsustainable national debt and high healthcare costs also make it harder to respond to public health crises like the COVID19 pandemic. Below is a look at the increasing healthcare costs in the United States what is causing that rapid growth and why it matters for public health and our fiscal outlook. The United States has one of the highest costs of healthcare in the world. In 2022 U.S. healthcare spending reached 4.5 trillion which averages to 13493 per person. By comparison the average cost of healthcare per person in other wealthy countries is less than half as much. While the COVID19 pandemic exacerbated the trend in rising healthcare costs such spending has been increasing long before COVID19 began. Relative to the size of the economy healthcare costs have increased over the past few decades from 5 percent of GDP in 1962 to 17 percent in 2022.   TWEET THIS  Generally healthcare spending can be thought of as a function of price dollars charged for healthcare services and utilization the amount of services used. There are several underlying factors that can increase price and utilization thereby boosting spending on healthcare. The most notable of those factors are an aging population and healthcare prices. The share of the U.S. population age 65 and over has increased over the past several years rising from 14 percent in 2012 to 17 percent in 2022. Furthermore that number is projected to continue climbing reaching 21 percent by 2032. Since people age 65 and over on average spend more on healthcare than any other age group growth in the number of older Americans is expected to increase total healthcare costs over time.    TWEET THIS  Furthermore as individuals turn 65 they will become eligible for Medicare and the number of enrollees in the program 65 million in 2022 will grow substantially. The increase in enrollment is expected to significantly increase the cost of Medicare over time. In fact the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare spending will nearly double over the next 30 years relative to the size of the economy growing from 3.1 percent of GDP in 2023 to 5.5 percent by 2053.   TWEET THIS  Prices are another significant driver of healthcare spending in the United States the cost of healthcare services typically grow faster than the cost of other goods and services in the economy. In the past 20 years the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers CPIU for all items the average change in prices paid by urban consumers for various goods and services has grown at an average of 2.6 percent per year while the CPIU for medical care has grown at an average rate of 3.1 percent per year. Over the past two years or so however the CPIU for medical care has been lower than the overall CPIU. In addition to historically high levels of overall inflation analysts point to wage increases for health workers and delays in observable price increases due to healthcare prices being set in advance as possible reasons for that trend.    TWEET THIS  There are many possible reasons for that increase in healthcare prices  More research needs to be done though to confirm the reasons that healthcare costs grow so quickly. It would be one thing if high healthcare spending led to better health outcomes. However that is not the case in the United States. When evaluating common health metrics the United States lags behind other countries despite spending more on such goods and services.    TWEET THIS  High healthcare costs put pressure on an already strained fiscal situation and are one of the primary drivers of the longterm structural imbalance between spending and revenues that is built into the country s budget. Containing high healthcare costs is important for our nation s longterm fiscal and economic wellbeing.

Policymakers should act now to strengthen it including by narrowing the wage gap between generalists and specialists.  Primary care providers PCPs serve as most people s first point of contact with the health care system. These clinicians build relationships with their patients over time and help coordinate care delivered by other health care providers.1 Evidence shows that a strong foundation of primary care yields better health outcomes overall greater equity in health care access and outcomes and lower per capita health costs.2 But in the United States decades of underinvestment and a low provider supply among other problems have limited access to effective primary care.3 This brief highlights gaps in the U.S. primary care system by comparing its performance to systems in 10 other highincome countries. We draw on data from the Commonwealth Fund s 2019 and 2020 international surveys along with data from the Fund s 2020 International Profiles of Health Care Systems. See How We Conducted This Study for further details. Good access to primary care includes the ability to a book an appointment with your doctor or regular place of care when care is needed. Research shows that in countries with better access to primary care patients are less likely to forgo needed care and as a result more likely to have better health outcomes.4 Having a regular doctor or place of care is important for preventing disease managing chronic conditions and coordinating specialty care. Prior research has found the U.S. has a lower supply of physicians compared to other countries.5 The majority of adults in all 11 countries reported having a regular doctor or place of care but adults in the U.S. and Sweden reported this at significantly lower rates than adults in most of the countries. Continuity of care is critical to the quality of treatment over time. There are several policies that can support the establishment of longterm patient provider relationships. In Norway patients are automatically registered with a PCP while in the United Kingdom patients are registered6 with a general practitioner or GP of their choice.7 In the United States such registration is far less common usually mandatory only for patients enrolled in certain managed care plans. Prior research shows that patients who have a longterm relationship with their PCP are less likely to go to the emergency department.8 Primary care continuity is also associated with improved care coordination and increased patient satisfaction.9 Among adults with a regular PCP those in the U.S. were significantly less likely to report having a longstanding relationship five years or more with this provider compared to all other countries but one Sweden. In the Netherlands and Germany nearly three of four adults reported having a longstanding relationship with their PCP. Several factors may contribute to the relative lack of continuous care in the U.S. including financial barriers changes in insurance coverage provider networks and location and the nation s low supply of PCPs. Home visits can strengthen the patient provider relationship evidence shows.10 Yet PCPs in the U.S. are significantly less likely to offer home visits than PCPs in all other countries in this analysis. In contrast all PCPs in the Netherlands and nearly all in France Germany Norway Sweden and the United Kingdom offer home visits. The lack of home visits in the U.S. also may be because of the low supply of providers. But a lack of financial incentives time and training for U.S. physicians as well as safety and liability concerns are additional possible factors.11 Making sure primary care is accessible outside standard practice hours can help patients avoid emergency department trips for nonurgent care.12 Among the 11 countries PCPs in the U.S. are the least likely to report having afterhours arrangements for their patients. Nearly all PCPs in Germany the Netherlands New Zealand and Norway have afterhour care arrangements. In fact nearly all general practitioners in Norway provide at least 50 hours of afterhours care annually to maintain their registration as GPs.13 Comprehensive primary care is about more than just physical health it also focuses on behavioral health and social needs that affect health such as access to nutritious food safe housing and stable income. PCPs are ideally positioned to monitor this range of needs and provide referrals to specialists as well as service providers outside the health care system. Across all the countries it is still relatively uncommon for PCPs to assess patients social needs including for housing food security transportation and ability to pay for basic needs like utilities as well as to screen for exposure to domestic violence or feelings of social isolation or loneliness. Such screenings were most common in the U.S. and France and least common in the Netherlands and Norway a difference that at least for the U.S. may be attributable to chronic underinvestment in social services that support healthy living conditions and population health.14 Patients in the Netherlands and Norway are less likely than those in the U.S. to say they worry about getting their social needs met data not shown.15 Adults in Canada the U.S. and Norway were more likely to report that their PCP provided them with information on how to get help for their social needs although this difference is only statistically significant with respect to Sweden Switzerland and Australia. In some countries like the United States higher rates of receiving such information may be a response to higher rates of material hardship along with a weaker social safety net. In addition to having universal health care robust welfare states like Sweden offer free or lowcost education subsidized childcare and transportation generous parental leave policies and guaranteed pension payments. Comprehensive primary care is best provided by multidisciplinary teams of health professionals that include social workers mental health providers and others specially trained to address social and behavioral health needs. PCPs in Canada and the U.S. are the most likely to have social workers on their care teams while this is almost never the case with German or Swiss PCPs. The relatively higher rate of social workers on U.S. primary care teams may be a function of underinvestment in certain types of social services. For example comparatively less U.S. funding is directed to meeting the needs of young and workingage people through early childhood education and parental leave allowances.16 The presence of social workers in U.S. primary care settings may therefore reflect the complexity and uncertainty of existing safetynet programs. Relatively small changes in earnings for people with low income for instance can result in Medicaid enrollment churn cycling on and off coverage as well as ineligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program SNAP.17 Nearly all Dutch and Swedish PCPs reported having a mental health worker on their team compared to onethird of PCPs in the U.S. and only 5 percent in Germany. This is despite the burden of mental health needs being among the highest in the U.S.18 Another central feature of primary care is the purposeful coordination of treatment provided by a patient s PCP with that provided by other clinicians in different settings. Because primary care is firstcontact care PCPs are well positioned to coordinate with the wider health care system making referrals to other health professionals as needed. Less than half of U.S. PCPs reported that they are usually informed when another provider changes their patient s care plan or medication regimen and that they are usually informed if their patient is admitted to a hospital or emergency department. That s about the average for the 11 countries we studied. PCPs from New Zealand were the most likely to usually receive this information from specialists and hospitals. Commonwealth Fund researchers have found that a substantial proportion of U.S. PCPs do not routinely receive timely notification when their patients are seen by other providers nor do they routinely receive important information resulting from these visits.19 While there is a shortage of health workers globally our analysis demonstrates that the U.S. primary care system trails far behind those of other countries in many areas particularly when it comes to health care access and continuity. These findings are consistent with prior research on the challenges facing primary care more broadly and are likely an outcome of chronic underinvestment in primary care in the United States.20 Evidence suggests that the shortcomings of U.S. primary care disproportionately affect predominantly Black and Latinx communities and rural areas exacerbating disparities that have widened during the COVID19 pandemic.21 There are several policy options for U.S. policymakers to consider as they work to improve primary care Narrow the U.S. wage gap between generalist and specialist physicians and subsidize medical school tuition fees to incentivize medical students to opt for primary care practice. The United States has the largest wage gap and highest tuition fees among the countries we studied.22 Invest in telehealth to allow more patients to access primary care. This is particularly important for rural residents and people with low income who face some of the tallest barriers to getting care.23 Only one in five U.S. PCPs reported that their practice provided video consultations before the COVID19 pandemic and just over a third of U.S. patients with a regular doctor or place of care said they have used a secure website or patient portal to communicate with their provider within the past two years data not shown.24 Expand payment reforms that reward and hold providers accountable for the continuity of care. Countries with topperforming health systems are able to reduce avoidable mortality through investment in primary care models that ensure continuity of care.25 Ensuring that patients can receive care afterhours and get treatment in their own homes is critical to avoiding unnecessary trips to the emergency department. There has been some recent progress in this area Medicare eliminated the requirement for providers to provide documentation that a home visit instead of an office visit is medically necessary.26 By removing this administrative hurdle this change should allow physicians to care for patients more easily in their homes and reduce fragmentation of care. Acknowledge the importance of meeting social service needs to people s health and wellbeing. Social determinants of health account for as much as 55 percent of health outcomes.27 While U.S. primary care appears to be somewhat more comprehensive in terms of screening for social needs our analysis also finds that U.S. adults are more likely to worry about their social needs in the first place especially compared to adults in Germany the Netherlands Norway and Sweden.28 Create financial incentives to facilitate communication between patients providers. The fragmentation in care between U.S. PCPs and specialists can have a negative impact on care quality cost and outcomes.29 In New Zealand primary health organizations received additional per capita funding to promote health and coordinate care.30 Introducing similar incentives in the U.S. could help. In its efforts to improve primary care the United States can learn a lot from what other highincome countries are doing. But there are also ample lessons to be learned from lowerincome countries such as Costa Rica whose health system is anchored by robust communityoriented primary health care.31 And in the era of COVID19 a greater understanding of changes and challenges to primary care particularly from the perspective of the physician is needed. To that end the Commonwealth Fund will release findings from its latest international survey focusing on primary care physicians in summer 2022. This analysis used data from the Commonwealth Fund s 2019 and 2020 international health policy surveys. The 2019 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey of Primary Care Physicians was administered to nationally representative samples of practicing primary care doctors in Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Sweden Switzerland the United Kingdom and the United States. These samples were drawn at random from government or private lists of primary care doctors in each country except France where they were selected from a nationally representative panel of primary care physicians. Within each country experts defined the physician specialties responsible for primary care recognizing that roles training and scopes of practice vary across countries. In all countries general practitioners GPs and family physicians were included with internists and pediatricians also sampled in Germany Switzerland and the United States. The questionnaire was designed with input from country experts and pretested in most countries. Pretest respondents provided feedback about question interpretation via semistructured cognitive interviews. SSRS a survey research firm worked with contractors in each country to survey doctors from January through June 2019 the field period ranged from seven to 19 weeks. Survey modes mail online and telephone were tailored based on each country s best practices for reaching physicians and maximizing response rates. Sample sizes ranged from 500 to 2569 and response rates ranged from 15 percent to 49 percent comparable to those in the 2015 survey. Final data were weighted to align with country benchmarks along key geographic and demographic dimensions. For the 2020 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey data were collected from nationally representative samples of noninstitutionalized adults age 18 and older in Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Switzerland Sweden the United Kingdom and the United States. Samples were generated using probabilitybased overlapping landline and mobile phone sampling designs in all but three countries. In Norway Sweden and Switzerland respondents were randomly selected from listed or nationwide population registries. In the U.S. an addressbased sampling frame was also incorporated to ensure a representative sample of respondents. Respondents completed surveys via landline and mobile phones as well as online in Sweden Switzerland and the United States. International partners cosponsored surveys and some supported expanded samples to enable withincountry analyses. Final country samples ranged from 607 to 4530 participants. The survey research firm SSRS was contracted to conduct the survey with country contractors from February through May 2020. The field period across countries ranged from four to 15 weeks. Response rates varied from 14 percent to 49 percent. Data were weighted using countryspecific demographic variables to account for differences in sample design and probability of selection.

It is a fundamental part of people s lives supporting their health and wellbeing. Moreover it matters because of its economic size and budgetary implications. The healthcare sector now employs 11 percent of American workers Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS 1980 2019b and authors calculations and accounts for 24 percent of government spending Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS 1987 2018 Bureau of Economic Analysis 1987 2018 authors calculations.1 Health insurance is the largest component 26 percent of nonwage compensation BLS 2019b and health care is one of the largest categories of consumer spending 8.1 percent of consumer expenditures BLS 2019a. A wellfunctioning healthcare sector is therefore a prerequisite for a wellfunctioning economy. Unfortunately the problems with U.S. health care are substantial. The United States spends more than other countries without obtaining better health outcomes Papanicolas Woskie and Jha 2018. Health care is growing as a share of the economy and government budgets in ways that appear unsustainable CMS 1960 2018 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD 2015. This growth has slowed at times health spending as a share of GDP was roughly flat in much of the 1990s and growth has also slowed to some extent in recent years. But even if expenditures as a share of GDP plateaued at their current level they would still represent a massive expenditure of resources. Sixty years ago health care was 5 percent of the U.S. economy as can be seen in figure A at 17.7 percent in 2018 it was more than three times that.  This growth represents a range of factors from new healthcare treatments and services to better coverage higher utilization and rising prices. Some of these changes are desirable As a country gets richer spending a higher share of income on health may be optimal Hall and Jones 2007.2 Countries with a higher level of output per capita tend to have a higher level of health expenditures per capita Sawyer and Cox 2018. In addition as the population ages health deteriorates and healthcare spending naturally rises. Finally if productivity advancements are more rapid in tradable goods like agriculture or manufacturing than in services like health care or education the latter will tend to rise in relative price and as a share of GDP.3 But some of the increase in healthcare costs is undesirable Cutler 2018. Rentseeking monopoly power and other flaws in healthcare markets sometimes result in unnecessary care or in elevated healthcare prices. In several of the facts that follow we describe these factors and how they are shaping health care. Spending by private and public payers have both increased. The United States has a healthcare system that largely consists of private providers and private insurance but as health care has become a larger part of the economy a higher share of healthcare funding has been provided by government figure B. As of 2018 34 percent of Americans received their health care via government insurance or direct public provision Berchick Barnett and Upton 2019.  As shown in figure C health care has doubled as a share of total government expenditures in the last three decades from 11.9 percent in 1990 to 24.1 percent in 2018. This increase comes from the rising shares of the population enrolled in Medicare Medicaid state Children s Health Insurance Programs and veterans health benefits. Policy changes like the introduction of the Medicare prescription drug benefit Part D in 2006 and a major expansion of Medicaid eligibility in 2014 played important roles. At the same time spending on discretionary programs like education and research and development have decreased as a share of GDP Congressional Budget Office 2020. If health expenditures continue to increase as a share of government spending the increase will eventually necessitate either tax increases or reduced spending on other important government functions like public safety infrastructure research and development and education.  Of course health costs are also borne by the private sector. Firms and households in the United States spent 10 percent of GDP on health care in 2018. Despite widespread coverage as of 2018 91.5 percent of Americans had either private or government health insurance for all or part of the year Berchick Barnett and Upton 2019 many people still face large and variable outofpocket healthcare costs. In 2017 more than 1 in 50 Americans who interact with the healthcare system have outofpocket costs in excess of 5000 and 1 in 200 have costs over 10000.4 At the other end of the distribution roughly one in seven have no outofpocket costs at all in a given year figure D.5 The upper end of the distribution of outofpocket costs dwarfs the liquid resources of many U.S. households meaning that many people faced with a negative health shock may also find themselves in financial trouble. Negative health shocks tend to be associated with loss of income thereby compounding the problem GarciaG mez et al. 2013. Unexpected health costs can generate bankruptcies and ongoing financial hardship Gross and Notowidigdo 2011.6 In this document we provide 12 facts about the economics of U.S. healthcare focusing largely on the privatepayer system. We highlight the surge in healthcare expenditures and their current high level. We note the wide variation of expenditures across individuals something that necessitates insurance. We document that the United States pays higher prices than most countries and that these prices vary widely across and within places. We show that a lack of competition and high administrative costs are especially important contributors to high expenditures indicating the need for reforms to reduce costs in the United States. To keep the focus on these issues we do not discuss questions of coverage or of how coverage is provided publicly or via the market but instead address the questions of why expenditures costs and prices are so high. This analysis aims to promote The Hamilton Project s mission to support broadly shared economic growth. Removing excess costs from the healthcare system is both an economic imperative and a complement to policy efforts to improve healthcare access and outcomes. In the following facts we provide context for understanding the landscape of policy options for reducing costs in the healthcare system. Spending on U.S. health care has grown steadily rising from 2900 per person in 1980 to 11200 per person in 2018 measured in 2018 dollars a 290 percent increase figure 1a. That growth has slowed at times as in the mid to late 1990s and early 2010s but since 1980 it amounts to annualized growth in real per capita spending of 3.6 percent. From 2005 to 2018 growth has been slower 2.0 percent per year.A small part of the reason for this growth is the aging of the U.S. population. As shown in figure 1b the United States spends 18100 on personal health care for an average person 65 to 84 years old and 35000 on an average person 85 or older while only spending 4000 on an average person 18 or younger.7 As the share of those 65 and older has risen healthcare spending per capita has increased accordingly. But this agingrelated increase is only a small portion of the overall rise in spending if the pattern of spending by age had remained constant at 2014 levels the aging that took place from 1980 to 2014 would have led to a 34 percent rise in per capita spending far below the 250 percent total increase over that same period.8 In addition as average age has increased underlying health conditions like obesity have gotten worse over time necessitating increased healthcare expenditures Paez Zhao and Hwang 2009 Cawley and Meyerhoefer 2012. Some of the increase simply reflects the growing spending that takes place as per capita income grows and some comes from innovations that bring new healthcare services and products. However the phenomenon called Baumol s cost disease describes how sectors with relatively low productivity growth like health care tend to experience rising costs Baumol and Bowen 1965 Baumol 2012. But understanding why health care has had little productivity growth relative to the rest of the economy is important Sheiner and Malinovskaya 2016. As we explore in subsequent facts problems with healthcare markets have contributed to rapidly rising costs in recent decades.  The United States spends much more on health care as a share of the economy 17.1 percent of GDP in 2017 using data from the World Health Organization WHO9 than other large advanced economies like Germany 11.2 percent and the United Kingdom 9.6 percent. Public spending by the United States 8.3 percent of GDP is roughly similar to public spending by other countries it is only when private spending is added that the United States far exceeds peer nations see figure 2. However public health insurance in the United States covers only 34 percent of the population much less than the universal coverage in countries like Canada and the United Kingdom Berchick Barnett and Upton 2019 OECD 2020b indicating that it costs far more to provide coverage in the U.S. system than around the world. Figure 2 distinguishes spending on the basis of the ultimate payer such that government payments to private providers are counted as public spending. Almost all U.S. health care is privately provided and 51 percent of spending is paid for by families nonprofits and businesses. This is in contrast to those countries that also rely largely on private providers but have the government as the payer e.g. Canada and those countries that rely both on public healthcare providers and public funding e.g. the United Kingdom. Note that the countries shown in figure 2 are highincome advanced nations with nearuniversal health coverage meaning that the gap in spending is not primarily explained by differences in coverage rates or income levels but rather by differences in healthcare institutions and policy. What do Americans get for their additional healthcare spending? In the United States life expectancy at birth is the lowest of the countries in figure 2 maternal and infant mortality are the highest Papanicolas Woskie and Jha 2018.10 Certainly other nonhealthcare factors contribute to these outcomes but poor U.S. performance stands in striking contrast to its high spending on health care Garber and Skinner 2008.  U.S. healthcare spending is high and has increased dramatically in recent decades. But what does the United States purchase with all this spending? Roughly a third of all healthcare spending goes to hospital care figure 3 making clear that the functioning of the U.S. hospital system is crucially important when healthcare expenditures are considered. Professional services make up roughly a quarter of spending. Professional services are those provided by physicians and nonphysicians outside of a hospital setting including dental services. The combination of longterm care nursing care facilities and home health care account for 13 percent of total health expenditures. Prescription drugs are next at 9 percent and net health insurance costs i.e. premiums earned less benefits paid account for 7 percent of total spending. Insurance covers these different expenditures to varying degrees. Consequently outofpocket spending looks somewhat different than overall spending the largest shares of outofpocket spending go to professional services 38 percent of total outofpocket spending and prescription drugs 13 percent CMS 2018 and authors calculations.11 Because prescription drugs are an ongoing expense for many and given the immediate and direct health impact that often results from a lack of access the costs of prescription drugs can dominate healthcare cost discussions. However for individuals and especially for the system as a whole the expense of professional services is much larger. Much health spending consists of labor costs rather than capital investment. One study of physicians offices hospitals and outpatient care found that labor compensation accounted for 49.8 percent of 2012 healthcare revenues Glied Ma and SolisRoman 2016. Lowering these labor costs requires some combination of increased labor supply e.g. more healthcare professionals fewer restrictions on what nonphysicians are permitted to do Adams and Markowitz 2018 and reductions in unnecessary services.  Healthcare spending in any given year is distributed very unequally. The half of the population using the least health care accounts for only 3 percent of total not just outofpocket expenditures excluding longterm care and some other components of spending12 while the top 1 percent accounts for 22 percent figure 4. One reason for this is that health misfortunes can strike at random causing oneyear expenditures to spike. In any given year the distribution can be very unequal but only some of those with the highest spending will continue to have high spending in subsequent years Cohen and Yu 2012. The bottom half of healthcare users are disproportionately young and consequently less likely to need expensive health care but apt to need it later in life. Many people will incur high endoflife expenditures such costs accounted for 13 percent of personal healthcare costs in 2011 Aldridge and Kelley 2015 but in any given year most people do not incur these costs. Also at 13 percent endoflife care is important but not a dominant part of U.S. healthcare costs.13 When individuals incur high costs insurance is usually necessary to prevent extreme financial hardship. The top 1 percent have mean healthcare expenditures of over 100000 and the next 4 percent have an average of 37000 expenses that are well beyond ability to pay for many families. At the same time the existence of insurance means that patients bear less financial responsibility for the cost of their care and have less incentive to control costs. In other cases such as emergencies patients are often unable to compare costs or weigh prices. Both of these features mean that normal downward pressures on prices may not operate in the standard way in a healthcare market.  Selfreported health is a wellestablished summary measure of a person s health that reliably correlates with objective health measures like laboratory biomarkers Schanzenbach et al. 2016. We use it in figure 5 to explore how the level and variation in healthcare expenditures total rather than outofpocket differ across people of varying health conditions. People enjoying good health are unsurprisingly not a major driver of healthcare expenditures. Among those who report excellent health even those at the 90th percentile of expenditures incur only 5780 in annual spending not far above the average of 2350 for that group. On the other end of the spectrum people who report being in poor health have average healthcare expenditures of 26450. More striking is the dramatically higher range of expenditure levels for those in poor health. People at the 90th percentile of expenditures for those in poor health have nearly 70000 spent on their behalf. Conversely the 10th percentile of those in poor health have just 700 in expenditures or 100 times less than the 90th percentile. The group of people who report poor health as well as low healthcare expenditures may have health problems that are not resolvable through expensive medical services but they may also be medically underserved whether because of a lack of insurance or other reasons Cunningham 2018. Regardless health status alone may not always be a good guide to expected expenditures in a given year.  Some places in the United States have considerably higher healthcare spending than others. This is not primarily a matter of elderly people being disproportionately represented in certain areas. Figure 6 shows spending per privately insured beneficiary after adjusting for differences across places in age and sex Cooper et al. 2019. The upper Midwest much of the east coast and northern California are all notable as places with especially high spending. In a comparison of socalled hospital referral regions i.e. regional health care markets spending per privately insured beneficiary is about three times higher in the highestspending region 6366 in Anchorage Alaska than in the lowestspending region 2110 in Honolulu Hawaii. Roughly half of the overall variation is associated with differences in prices across regions with the other half due to differences in the quantity of health care consumed. Surprisingly a significant amount of the national variation in prices occurs within hospitals Cooper et al. 2019. Medicare spending is somewhat different prices are set administratively rather than through decentralized negotiations between payers and providers. Most of the geographic variation in Medicare spending is accounted for by differences in healthcare utilization across places especially in postacute care rather than by prices Cooper et al. 2019. Further about half of the variation in utilization is driven by demandside factors like health and preferences but differences in supply across places are also important Finkelstein Gentzkow and Williams 2016. Is this spending variation evidence of a problem that policy should address? The answer and the policy response if one is called for depends on whether spending is especially high in some places because of insufficient competition and related market failures Cooper et al. 2019 differences in physician behavior Cutler et al. 2019 a larger share of people with expensive health conditions Rosenthal 2012 or a higher cost of living and other factors not directly related to the functioning of health markets.  In a wellfunctioning competitive market prices for the same service will not vary widely within a given place consumers will avoid a business that charges much higher prices than its competitors. However many healthcare markets dramatically violate this expectation. Figure 7 focuses on healthcare price variation within selected metro areas showing that some metropolitan statistical areas feature much more price variation than others. For example estimates from the Health Care Cost Institute show that the price for a blood test ranges from 22 10th percentile to 37 90th percentile in Baltimore Maryland but in El Paso Texas the same range is 144 to 952. For a Csection delivery prices vary widely both across and within markets the 10th to 90th percentile range is 9.3 times larger in the San Francisco California metro area than in the Knoxville Tennessee metropolitan area. Some variation in prices is due to differences in quality and amenities one medical practice might take more time with patients have nicer facilities or employ more experienced medical teams allowing it to charge correspondingly higher prices. But much of the variation is likely related to market imperfections that limit the ability and incentive for patients to shop for the lowest price Chernew Dafny and Pany 2020 Tu and Lauer 2009 Mehrotra et al. 2017. A Hamilton Project proposal by Michael Chernew Leemore Dafny and Maximilian Pany 2020 would address this type of healthcare price dispersion with regulatory interventions directed at the most egregious price growth.  The United States has dramatically higher healthcare prices than other advanced economies. This is the case for surgical procedures diagnostic tests prescription drugs and almost any other type of healthcare service. Figure 8 shows seven other countries prices as a percentage of the U.S. price for selected healthcare services Hargraves and Bloschichak 2019. For example a Humira Pen costs between 16 percent South Africa and 35 percent Germany of the U.S. average price. Relatively high U.S. prices are not just about higher prescription drug prices the bottom panel of figure 8 and the implicit subsidies that the United States provides to the rest of the world much of which imposes price controls on prescription drugs by paying the fixed costs of drug research and development Wagner and McCarthy 2004. The United States also has higher prices for outpatient procedures like colonoscopies MRIs and cardiac catheterization and hospital procedures like Csections and bypass surgeries Hargraves and Bloschichak 2019. For example a hip replacement surgery costs between 21 percent Holland and 64 percent Australia of the average price in the United States.14 These patterns are consistent with research showing that high U.S. prices are an important part of high U.S. spending on health care Papanicolas Woskie and Jha 2018.15 High prices indicate underlying concerns that are different than those indicated by high use of health care. In particular prices so far above those in other countries can reflect rents i.e. payments to the healthcare system beyond what is necessary for a normal rate of profit. These rents are driven by market imperfections including provider market power and the difficulty that healthcare patients and other payers have in assessing prices and quality Chernew Dafny and Pany 2020. In addition excess administrative costs see fact 10 and generally higher wages for highly educated workers in the United States contribute to relatively high U.S. prices.  One reason for high prices and high healthcare costs is that competition is unusually weak in the healthcare system. Consolidation of medical providers barriers to market entry and the closing of some hospitals have led to high and rising market concentration which allows providers to set higher prices without losing patients. Figure 9 describes this situation in terms of a commonly used concentration metric called the HerfindahlHirschman Index HHI. This index captures the degree to which market share is concentrated in a few organizations and it is an important assessment tool for antitrust policy. Under the Department of JusticeFederal Trade Commission Merger Guidelines an HHI of 1500 indicates a moderately concerning concentration level and an HHI of 2500 indicates high concentration. As shown in the figure insurers specialist physicians and hospitals are all above this latter threshold with hospital concentration especially high with an HHI of 5790 in 2016. Primary care physicians are between the moderate and high concentration levels but they have experienced a rapid increase in HHI as private practices have been acquired Capps Dranove and Ody 2017 Capps Dranove and Ody 2018 Fulton 2017. Figure 9 shows mean HHI across metropolitan areas rather than the national level. It therefore does not increase when a hospital in New York merges with a hospital in California for example. While this is appropriate for understanding the range of choices available to a patient it does not capture the deleterious effects of consolidations across geographic areas Dafny Ho and Lee 2019 Lewis and Pflum 2017. As explained in Gaynor 2020 hospitals that consolidate across areas gain leverage in negotiations with insurers who prefer to offer large employers a health plan that includes many provider options throughout the United States. Reversing consolidation that has already occurred is likely to be difficult. But policymakers can take steps to prevent additional consolidation and promote competition in other ways as described in a Hamilton Project proposal by Martin Gaynor 2020.  Administrative healthcare costs are higher as a share of GDP in the United States than in other countries. These administrative i.e. nonclinical costs take several forms claims processing and payment prior authorization and eligibility determinations and quality measurement among others. While a certain amount of this administrative expense is inevitable and necessary for a wellfunctioning system public or private the excess of U.S. costs over those of other advanced economies is part of the explanation for high U.S. healthcare costs overall Cutler and Ly 2011. Figure 10 shows two different estimates of administrative costs in the healthcare systems of the United States and several other countries. The OECD estimates include only payers costs to administer health benefits and coverage while the estimates by Himmelstein and coauthors include only administrative costs to hospitals OECD 2020a Himmelstein et al. 2014.16 The differences between the United States and other countries are notable. The United States spent 1.4 percent of GDP on hospital administrative costs in 2010 compared with 0.8 percent in the Netherlands and just 0.4 percent in Canada. On the payers side the United States is also an outlier spending 1.2 percent of GDP on payers administrative costs compared with just 0.2 percent in the United Kingdom. One reason for administrative costs is to reduce nonadministrative costs related to excess use of healthcare services. For example priorauthorization requirements can reduce costs and limit use of the most expensive drug options Soumerai 2004. However these requirements impose costs on patients and providers that must be taken into account and in some cases they may simply reflect a battle over who pays for necessary procedures. Administrative costs cannot and should not be completely eliminated even in a public system like the United Kingdom s but they can be affected by policies and practices. In a Hamilton Project proposal David Cutler 2020 describes reforms that would reduce administrative costs without impairing important functions of the healthcare system.  Healthcare providers have become a larger share of the labor force rising from 5.0 percent of employment in 1980 to 8.5 percent in 2019 BLS 1980 2019b and authors calculations.17 However labor supply has been limited in important ways. In figure 11a we show the rate of medical residency positions per 100000 U.S. residents that were available over the last 60 years. These positions are a necessary part of physician training required just after medical school. Historically the federal government has heavily subsidized a certain number of residency positions Heisler et al. 2018 hospitals have been reluctant to provide many residencies without subsidy. From 1960 through 2010 per capita medical residency positions increased only slightly rising from 6.9 to 7.4 per 100000 people. A more rapid increase occurred since 2010 as a number of osteopathic programs entered the data bringing the rate to 9.8 in 2019 about 32000 total positions but still below the application rate.18The flat rate contrasted with rising expenditures and healthcare needs for an aging and richer population suggests that limited supply has been a problem. In healthcare occupations generally training requirements have steadily risen. In 2000 for example physical therapists were required to have either a fouryear degree or a master s degree in every state. By 2015 43 states required that they obtain a doctorate degree to be legally permitted to practice Cai and Kleiner 2016.19 Limited labor supply contributes to high wages which in turn contribute to high healthcare prices in the United States20 As shown in figure 11b the median annual income of U.S. physicians is 199500 well above the 90th percentile of overall income 126900. In 1980 the typical physician earned 3.27 times the median wage for all workers compared with 3.84 times today. Growth in physicians salaries has coincided with the general rise in inequality at the top of the earnings distribution. In comparison with other advanced economies U.S. physicians earn considerably higher salaries than their counterparts Kane et al. 2019 Peterson and Burton 2007.  In a wellfunctioning market consumers are able to observe price and quality differences between different options. Healthcare markets often fail to meet this standard. One striking way in which they fail is a practice called surprise billing when insured patients find out after receiving healthcare services at an innetwork facility that a provider e.g. a surgeon in the emergency department or the anesthesiologist administering an epidural during childbirth was outside of their insurance network and is consequently much more expensive than they had anticipated. This raises costs to consumers and also allows providers to charge higher prices than those that were negotiated by insurers raising overall costs. Figure 12 shows that surprise billing is very common when patients use ambulance services 51 69 percent or the emergency department visits 19 22 percent and somewhat common even when receiving elective hospital care 9 percent.21 Surprise billing in emergencies presents special problems patients and their families have little or no ability to compare prices and choose the best option even if they are aware of the prices they face. Moreover health insurance cannot function as insurance if patients often incur extraordinarily large and unexpected bills when the need for expensive medical procedures arises nor can insurers bargain down prices on behalf of their beneficiaries. Surprise billing is indeed associated with substantially higher medical bills. According to USCBrookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy calculations the medical providers who often have the ability to engage in surprise billing practitioners in anesthesiology emergency medicine diagnostic radiology and pathology for example tend to charge large multiples of Medicare allowed amounts. Mean charges for emergency medicine are 5.4 times higher than Medicare rates for example compared with a 2.2 multiple for primary care Adler et al. 2019 which is more likely to be innetwork and have prices negotiated by an insurance plan.  1 The share of healthcare employment refers to the share employed by the healthcare industry. 2 However see Acemoglu Finkelstein and Notowidigdo 2013 for a contrasting view. They find that the income elasticity of health care is likely below one. 3 This dynamic is referred to as Baumol s cost disease and reflects the need for servicesector wages to keep pace with rising wages in the sectors with high productivity growth. 4 These calculations use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey MEPS which excludes longterm care and other components of healthcare spending that are included in the national health care expenditure accounts NHEA data from Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services CMS used elsewhere in this document. These excluded expenditures could be distributed unevenly across the population and can therefore affect the patterns shown in figures based on MEPS data. For more on a comparison of the types of spending covered in the MEPS and spending covered in the NHEA which is used in other figures in this document see Bernard et al. 2012. 5 Highdeductible plans have sometimes been suggested as a way to increase the sensitivity of patients to healthcare prices. However these plans seem to lead patients to reduce their spending indiscriminately cutting valuable and lessvaluable care alike BrotGoldberg et al. 2017.  6 However it is important not to overemphasize the role of health expenses in generating bankruptcies recent research suggests that hospitalizations of uninsured adults generate only about 6 percent of bankruptcies for that group Dobkin et al. 2018. 7 Data are for 2014 the most recent year for which spending data by age are available from CMS and are adjusted to 2018 dollars using the GDP chain price index. These per capita costs are for personal healthcare spending which is a subset of the total spending presented in figure 1a and excludes government administration net cost of health insurance the difference between the premiums paid for private health insurance and the amount paid for benefits government public health activities and investment in research and structures. 8 This calculation focuses on the 1980 to 2014 period rather than 1980 to 2018 due to limited data on spending by age. 9 This estimate for the United States is slightly lower than that shown in figure A which is based on data from CMS. 10 This comparison excludes Italy which is not included in Papanicolas Woskie and Jha 2018. 11 In the MEPS which excludes longterm care and other components of healthcare spending that are included in the national health care expenditure accounts data from CMS both outofpocket and total spending on prescriptions are roughly 25 percent of total outofpocket spending and total expenditures respectively. 12 The MEPS excludes longterm care and other components of healthcare spending that are included in the national health care expenditure accounts data from CMS used elsewhere in this document. These excluded expenditures are likely distributed unevenly across the population and can therefore affect the patterns shown in figures based on MEPS data. For more on a comparison of the types of spending covered in the MEPS and spending covered in the NHEA which is used in other figures in this document see Bernard et al. 2012. 13 It is not always clear in advance that such care is endoflife in other words the hope is that patients will recover as a result of the care. As such the amount spent knowingly at the end of life is even lower Einav et al. 2018. 14 It is not surprising that the United States has higher prices than poorer countries. The BalassaSamuelson effect notes that highincome countries have higher prices for nontraded goods and services like health care than lowincome countries Balassa 1964 Samuelson 1964. But the BalassaSamuelson effect does not predict much variation among highincome countries and yet the United States is clearly at the upper end of the price distribution for health care. 15Other studies of international price differences have sometimes found the United States to be less of an outlier but still high. For example one survey found that U.S. hospital service prices are only 30 percent higher than the OECD average and just slightly above those of countries like Canada and Austria Lorenzoni and Koechlin 2017. 16 Neither of these estimates includes administrative costs to providers. Thus these calculations embody a different accounting of administrative costs than is cited in Cutler 2020 and the estimated fractions of healthcare expenditures are substantially lower. 17 Healthcare providers share of the labor force refers to healthcare occupations. 18 As described by the American Medical Association The number of available firstyear PGY1 positions rose to 32194 an increase of 1962 6.5 percent over the prior year. That increase in opportunity reflects the growth in the number of osteopathic programs joining the Main Residency Match as a result of the ongoing transition to a single accreditation system for graduate medical education GME programs Murphy 2019. 20 However it is less clear what limited healthcare labor supply implies for service use which may diminish when labor supply is restricted. 21 Surprise billing is also more likely when a health plan has no innetwork options at a hospital in a particular provider category. In a study of Texas hospitals between 21 percent and 56 percent of innetwork hospitals had no innetwork emergency physicians depending on the health plan Hall et al. 2016 citing Center for Public Policy Priorities 2014.  ryandnunn Jana Parsons Former Research Analyst The Hamilton Project JanaMKParsons Jay Shambaugh Under Secretary for International Affairs U.S. Department of the Treasury JayCShambaugh More On Health Care Policy ProgramEconomic Studies The Hamilton Project  Rena M.

Germany spends less on health care per capita than the U.S. yet life expectancy at birth is nearly four years higher. Photo Jens SchlueterGetty Images   The U.S. spends nearly 18 percent of GDP on health care yet Americans die younger and are less healthy than residents of other highincome countries   Not only does the U.S. have the lowest life expectancy among highincome countries but it also has the highest rates of avoidable deaths   The U.S. spends nearly 18 percent of GDP on health care yet Americans die younger and are less healthy than residents of other highincome countries   Not only does the U.S. have the lowest life expectancy among highincome countries but it also has the highest rates of avoidable deaths  In the previous edition of U.S. Health Care from a Global Perspective we reported that people in the United States experience the worst health outcomes overall of any highincome nation.1 Americans are more likely to die younger and from avoidable causes than residents of peer countries. Between January 2020 and December 2021 life expectancy dropped in the U.S. and other countries.2 With the pandemic a continuing threat to global health and wellbeing we have updated our 2019 crossnational comparison of health care systems to assess U.S. health spending outcomes status and service use relative to Australia Canada France Germany Japan the Netherlands New Zealand Norway South Korea Sweden Switzerland and the United Kingdom. We also compare U.S. health system performance to the OECD average for the 38 highincome countries for which data are available. The data for our analysis come from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD and other international sources see How We Conducted This Study for details. For every metric we examine we used the latest data available. This means that results for certain countries may reflect the height of the COVID19 pandemic when mental health conditions were surging essential health services were disrupted and patients may not have received the same level of care.3 In all countries health spending as a share of the overall economy has been steadily increasing since the 1980s as spending growth has outpaced economic growth.4 This growth is in part because of medical technologies rising prices in the health sector and higher demand for services.5 In 2020 when the COVID19 pandemic began health care spending rose rapidly in nearly all countries as governments sought to mitigate the spread of the disease through COVID testing vaccine development relief funds and other measures.6 Since then spending has slowed but still remains higher from years prior.7 In 2021 the U.S. spent 17.8 percent of gross domestic product GDP on health care nearly twice as much as the average OECD country. Health spending per person in the U.S. was nearly two times higher than in the closest country Germany and four times higher than in South Korea. In the U.S. that includes spending for people in public programs like Medicaid the Children s Health Insurance Program Medicare and military plans spending by those with private employersponsored coverage or other private insurance and outofpocket health spending. All countries in this analysis except the U.S. guarantee government or public health coverage to all their residents. In addition to public coverage people in several of the countries have the option to also purchase private coverage. In France nearly the entire population has both private and public insurance. In 2021 8.6 percent of the U.S. population was uninsured.8 The U.S. is the only highincome country where a substantial portion of the population lacks any form of health insurance. Despite high U.S. spending Americans experience worse health outcomes than their peers around world. For example life expectancy at birth in the U.S. was 77 years in 2020 three years lower than the OECD average. Provisional data shows life expectancy in the U.S. dropped even further in 2021.9 In the U.S. life expectancy masks racial and ethnic disparities.10 Average life expectancy in 2019 for nonHispanic Black Americans 74.8 years and nonHispanic American Indians or Alaska Natives 71.8 years is four and seven years lower respectively than it is for nonHispanic whites 78.8 years. Meanwhile life expectancy for Hispanic Americans 81.9 years is higher than it is for whites and similar to life expectancy in the Netherlands New Zealand and Canada. As a group Asian Americans have a higher life expectancy 85.6 years than people in Japan. Avoidable mortality refers to deaths that are preventable and treatable. Preventable deaths can be avoided through effective public health measures and through primary prevention such as nutritional diet and exercise. Treatable mortality can be avoided mainly through timely and effective health care interventions including regular exams screenings and treatment.11 Since 2015 avoidable deaths have been on the rise in the U.S. which had the highest rate in 2020 of all the countries in our analysis. In 2020 the infant mortality rate in the U.S. was 5.4 deaths per 1000 live births the highest rate of all the countries in our analysis. In contrast there were 1.6 deaths per 1000 live births in Norway. Women in the U.S. have long had the highest rate of maternal mortality related to complications of pregnancy and childbirth. In 2020 there were nearly 24 maternal deaths for every 100000 live births in the U.S. more than three times the rate in most of the other highincome countries we studied. A high rate of cesarean section inadequate prenatal care and socioeconomic inequalities contributing to chronic illnesses like obesity diabetes and heart disease may all help explain high U.S. infant and maternal mortality.12 Elevated suicide rates which have dramatically increased during the COVID19 pandemic can indicate a high burden of mental illness.13 The U.S. has the thirdhighest suicide rate while the U.K. has the lowest nearly half the U.S. rate. The U.S. is an outlier in deaths from physical assault which includes gun violence. Its 7.4 deaths per 100000 people is far above the OECD average of 2.7 and at least seven times higher than all other highincome countries in our study except New Zealand. Obesity is a key risk factor for chronic conditions such as diabetes hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Issues that contribute to obesity include unhealthy living environments lessregulated food and agricultural sectors lower socioeconomic status and higher rates of behavioral health problems.14 The U.S. has the highest obesity rate among the countries we studied where data was available nearly two times higher than the OECD average. In 2020 three of 10 U.S. adults surveyed said at some point in their lifetime they had been diagnosed with two or more chronic conditions such as asthma cancer depression diabetes heart disease or hypertension. No more than a quarter of residents in the other countries studied reported the same and the U.S. rate was nearly twice as high as France s. Since the start of the COVID19 pandemic more people in the U.S. have died from the coronavirus than any in any other highincome country. For every 1 million cases between January 22 2020 and January 18 2023 there were more than 3000 deaths in the U.S. While U.S. health care spending is the highest in the world Americans overall visit physicians less frequently than residents of most other highincome countries. At four visits per person per year Americans see the doctor less often than the OECD average. Lessfrequent physician visits may be related to the comparatively low supply of physicians in the U.S. which is below the average number of practicing physicians in OECD countries. The average length of a hospital stay in the U.S. for all inpatient care was 4.8 days far lower than the OECD average. The U.S. had 2.8 hospital beds per 1000 population lower than the OECD average of 4.3. More than twothirds of older Americans receive the flu vaccine similar to older residents of several other highincome countries and more than the OECD average. The U.S. however has one of the lowest COVID19 vaccination rates among highincome countries. As of January 2023 69 percent of the population were fully vaccinated compared to 86 percent in South Korea although rates are regularly being updated. The U.S. does relatively well with cancer prevention. This is likely a reflection of extensive screening and detection a key to diagnosing breast and colorectal cancers early and beginning treatment in a timely manner.15 The U.S. and Sweden had the highest number of breast cancer screenings among women ages 50 to 69 notably higher than the OECD average. In contrast just 43 percent of women ages 50 to 69 were screened in France. When it comes to colorectal cancer screening the U.S. exceeded the OECD average and had among the highest rates. Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI is a common and effective imaging technique for diagnosing and tracking the treatment of a variety of illnesses. The countries that use these specialized scans the most are the U.S. Japan France Norway and Germany with more than 100 scans per 1000 people. The U.S. has a high number of MRI units available to physicians about 38 units for every 1 million people in 2018. That s the secondhighest rate in the world behind Japan which has 51.7 units per 1 million people.16 While their clinical benefit as a diagnostic tool is well documented MRIs are particularly expensive in the U.S. averaging 1119.17 That s 42 percent more than the U.K. s average cost and 420 percent more than Australia s. And while MRIs are accessible in the U.S. Americans spend far more on them than their international peers do.18 Globally rates of hip replacement are increasing as populations age and develop conditions like osteoarthritis the leading reason for the procedure which can substantially improve an individual s quality of life.19 Hip replacements are an important indicator of the prevalence of osteoarthritis in a population. While the United States spends more on health care than any other highincome country the nation often performs worse on measures of health and health care. For the U.S. a first step to improvement is ensuring that everyone has access to affordable care. Not only is the U.S. the only country we studied that does not have universal health coverage but its health system can seem designed to discourage people from using services. Affordability remains the top reason why some Americans do not sign up for health coverage while high outofpocket costs lead nearly half of workingage adults to skip or delay getting needed care.20 The Inflation Reduction Act which will help reduce the high cost of certain drugs and cap outofpocket costs for older Americans is a step in the right direction.21 But it will take much more to make health care as easy to access as it is in other highincome countries. A second step is containing costs. Other countries have achieved better health outcomes while spending much less on health care overall. In the U.S. high prices for health services continue to be the primary driver of this elevated spending.22 U.S. policymakers and health systems could look to some of the approaches taken by other nations to contain overall health spending including health care and administrative costs. A third step is better prevention and management of chronic conditions. Critical to this is developing the capacity to offer comprehensive continuous wellcoordinated care. Decades of underinvestment along with an inadequate supply of health care providers have limited many Americans access to effective primary care.23 The findings of our international comparison demonstrate the importance of a health care system that supports chronic disease prevention and management the early diagnosis and treatment of medical problems affordable access to health care coverage and cost containment among the key functions of a highperforming system. Other countries have found ways to do these things well the U.S. can as well.

This analysis used data from the 2022 release of health statistics compiled by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD which tracks and reports on a wide range of health system measures across 38 highincome countries. Data were extracted in December 2022. While data collected by the OECD reflect the gold standard in international comparisons one limitation is that data may mask differences in how countries collect their health data. Full details on how indicators were defined as well as countrylevel differences in definitions are available from the OECD.24 For the 2020 Commonwealth Fund International Health Policy Survey data were collected from nationally representative samples of noninstitutionalized adults age 18 and older in Australia Canada France Germany the Netherlands New Zealand Norway Switzerland Sweden the United Kingdom and the United States. Samples were generated using probabilitybased overlapping landline and mobile phone sampling designs in all but three countries. In Norway Sweden and Switzerland respondents were randomly selected from listed or nationwide population registries. In the U.S. an addressbased sampling frame was also incorporated to ensure a representative sample of respondents. Respondents completed surveys via landline and mobile phones as well as online in Sweden Switzerland and the U.S. International partners cosponsored surveys and some supported expanded samples to enable withincountry analyses. Final country samples ranged from 607 to 4530 participants. The survey research firm SSRS was contracted to conduct the survey with country contractors from February through May 2020. The field period across countries ranged from four to 15 weeks. Response rates varied from 14 percent to 49 percent. Data were weighted using countryspecific demographic variables to account for differences in sample design and probability of selection. This analysis used data from Our World in Data which compiles data from most countries and territories around the world across a range of measures. Data for confirmed COVID19 deaths and COVID19 vaccination rates were extracted in January 2023. A limitation of both data sets is that they only report confirmed deaths and reported vaccination rates which Our World in Data notes can be underestimates. Full details on how indicators are defined as well as countrylevel differences in data collection are available from Our World in Data.25 The effects of the COVID19 pandemic including job loss and the postponement or forgoing of needed care likely worsened many health outcomes.26 Therefore some of our crosscountry analyses should be interpreted with caution as data for 2020 and beyond were not available for all countries or for every measure. As businesses and health care facilities continue to reopen and return to preCOVID levels of operation the health burdens individuals faced globally during the pandemic may continue to linger. Another limitation of our study is that are we were unable to break out the data by race and ethnicity. Research has uncovered huge health disparities in the U.S. particularly for Black and Latino Americans.27 Efforts to collect data by race and ethnicity are needed on a global level to allow policymakers to not only make crosscountry comparisons but also to see how health outcomes compare among vulnerable and historically neglected populations around the world.
