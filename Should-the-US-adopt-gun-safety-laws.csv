https://gun-control.procon.org/, Gun control laws are just as old or older than the Second Amendment ratified in 1791. Some examples of gun control throughout colonial America included criminalizing the transfer of guns to Catholics enslaved people indentured servants and Native Americans regulating the storage of gun powder in homes banning loaded guns in Boston houses and mandating participation in formal gathering of troops and doortodoor surveys about guns owned. Guns were common in the American Colonies first for hunting and general selfprotection and later as weapons in the American Revolutionary War. Several colonies gun laws required that heads of households including women own guns and that all ablebodied men enroll in the militia and carry personal firearms.

Heller U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion Justice Antonin Scalia wrote Like most rights the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms. 3 On June 9 2016 the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 74 that the right of the general public to carry a concealed firearm in public is not and never has been protected by the Second Amendment thus upholding a law requiring a permitting process and good cause for concealed carry licenses in California. 145 146 A 2018 study found that 91 of the 1153 court cases with claims stating a government action or law violate the Second Amendment between the 2008 D.C. v. Heller decision and Feb. 1 2016 failed. 157 Further the Second Amendment was intended to protect the right of militias to own guns not the right of individuals to own guns. Former Justice John Paul Stevens in his dissenting opinion for District of Columbia et al. v. Heller wrote the Framer s singleminded focus in crafting the constitutional guarantee to keep and bear arms was on military use of firearms which they viewed in the context of service in state militias hence the inclusion of the phrase well regulated militia. 3 Michael Waldman President of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law stated there is nothing about an individual right to bear arms in the notes about the Second Amendment when it was being drafted discussed or ratified the US Supreme Court declined to rule in favor of the individual right four times between 1876 and 1939 and all law articles on the Second Amendment from 1888 to 1959 stated that an individual right was not guaranteed. 47 There were 572537 total gun deaths between 1999 and 2016 336579 suicides 58.8 of total gun deaths 213175 homicides 37.2 and 11428 unintentional deaths 2.0. Guns were the leading cause of death by homicide 67.7 of all homicides and by suicide 51.8 of all suicides. Firearms were the second leading cause of deaths for children responsible for 15 of child deaths compared to 20 in motor vehicle crashes. 30 162 Female firsttime firearm owners were 35 times more likely to commit suicide within 12 years of buying the gun compared to women who did not own guns male firsttime firearm owners were about eight times more likely to do so. 171 172 Approximately 50 of unintentional fatal shootings were selfinflicted and most unintentional firearm deaths were caused by friends or family members. 418 Five women are murdered with guns every day in the United States. A woman s risk of being murdered increases 500 if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. During the Iraq and Afghanistan wars 5364 US soldiers were killed in action between Oct. 7 2001 and Jan. 28 2015 between 2001 and 2012 6410 women were killed with a gun by an intimate partner in the United States. 10 11 12 A study published in the American Journal of Public Health found that legal purchase of a handgun appears to be associated with a longlasting increased risk of violent death 6 Researchers found that a general barrier to firearm access created through state regulation can have a significant deterrent effect on male suicide rates in the United States. Permit requirements and bans on sales to minors were the most effective of the regulations analyzed. 32 According to a Mar. 10 2016 Lancet study implementing federal universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths by a projected 56.9 background checks for ammunition purchases could reduce deaths by a projected 80.7 and gun identification requirements could reduce deaths by a projected 82.5. 148 Gun licensing laws were associated with a 14 decrease in firearm homicides while increases in firearm homicides were seen in places with righttocarry and standyour groundlaws. 158160 More gun control leads to fewer suicides. When US gun ownership goes down overall suicide rates drop meanwhile each 10 percentagepoint increase in gun ownership is linked to a 26.9 increase in the youth suicide rate. In Indiana and Connecticut after red flag laws to remove guns from people who may pose a threat were enacted gun suicides decreased by 7.5 and 13.7 respectively while suicides by other means did not decrease during the same time. A person who wants to kill himherself is unlikely to commit suicide with poison or a knife when a gun is unavailable. 31 33 158 159 164 The US General Accountability Office GAO estimated that 31 of total accidental shooting deaths could have been prevented by installing safety devices on guns 100 of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills himherself or another child could be prevented by automatic childproof safety locks and 23 of accidental shooting deaths by adolescents and adults per year could be prevented by loading indicators showing when a bullet was in the chamber ready to be fired. 35  Marjorie Sanfilippo PhD Professor of Psychology at Eckerd College who has researched children s behavior around guns stated We put gates around swimming pools to keep children from drowning. We put safety caps on medications to keep children from poisoning themselves . Because children are naturally curious and impulsive and because we have shown time and again that we cannot gunproof them with education we have a responsibility to keep guns out of the hands of children. 36 The FBI found that arguments such as romantic triangles brawls fueled by alcohol or drugs and arguments over money resulted in 1962 gun deaths 59.9 of the total. 37 An editorial published in the American Journal of Public Health noted guninflicted deaths often ensue from impromptu arguments and fights in the US twothirds of the 7900 deaths in 1981 involving arguments and brawls were caused by guns. A study published in the same journal found that the weapons used in altercations were those closest at hand. And thus according to another study rather than confer protection guns kept in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance. 38 39 40 Statistics show that guns are rarely used in selfdefense. Of the 29618300 violent crimes committed between 2007 and 2011 0.79 of victims 235700 protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm the leastemployed protective behavior. In 2010 there were 230 justifiable homicides in which a private citizen used a firearm to kill a felon compared to 8275 criminal gun homicides or 36 criminal homicides for every justifiable homicide . Of the 84495500 property crimes committed between 2007 and 2011 0.12 of victims 103000 protected themselves with a threat of use or use of a firearm. 16 17 Further armed civilians are unlikely to stop crimes and are more likely to make dangerous situations including mass shootings more deadly. None of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012 were stopped by an armed civilian. Jeffrey Voccola Assistant Professor of Writing at Kutztown University notes The average gun owner no matter how responsible is not trained in law enforcement or on how to handle lifethreatening situations so in most cases if a threat occurs increasing the number of guns only creates a more volatile and dangerous situation. 41 43 Common sense gun control laws can decrease the likelihood of a violent situation turning deadly. President Ronald Reagan and others did not think the AR15 military rifle also called M16s by the Air Force should be owned by civilians and when the AR15 was included in the assault weapons ban of 1994 which expired on Sep. 13 2004 the NRA supported the legislation. A Mother Jones investigation found that highcapacity magazines were used in at least 50 of the 62 mass shootings between 1982 and 2012.When highcapacity magazines were used in mass shootings the death rate rose 63 and the injury rate rose 156. 7 8 48 The Second Amendment was written at a time when the most common arms were long rifles that had to be reloaded after every shot. Civilians today have access to folding detaching or telescoping stocks that make the guns more easily concealed and carried silencers to muffle gunshot sounds flash suppressors to fire in lowlight conditions without being blinded by the flash and to conceal the shooter s location or grenade launcher attachments. Jonathan Lowy Director of Legal Action Project at the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence states These are weapons that will shred your venison before you eat it or go through the walls of your apartment when you re trying to defend yourself they are made for mass killing but not useful for lawabiding citizens. 49 50 According to a Feb. 20 2018 Quinnipiac Poll 97 of American voters and 97 of gun owners support universal background checks. 67 support a nationwide ban on assault weapons and 83 support mandatory waiting periods for gun purchases. 155 As much as 40 of all gun sales are undocumented private party gun sales that do not require a background check aka the gun show loophole . 28 53 of all adults surveyed approve of highcapacity magazine bans. 89 of adults with a gun in the home approve of laws to prevent the purchase of guns by the mentally ill and 82 approve of banning gun sales to people on nofly lists. 27  77 of Americans support requiring a license to purchase a gun. 165 Don Macalady member of Hunters against Gun Violence stated As a hunter and someone who has owned guns since I was a young boy I believe that commonsense gun legislation makes us all safer. Background checks prevent criminals and other dangerous people from getting guns. 29 Many would like to see the U.S. enact more laws like other countries citing the fact that countries with restrictive gun control laws have lower gun homicide and suicide rates than the United States. Both Switzerland and Finland require gun owners to acquire licenses and pass background checks that include mental and criminal records among other restrictions and requirements. In 2007 Switzerland ranked number 3 in international gun ownership rates with 45.7 guns per 100 people about 3400000 guns total. In 2009 Switzerland had 24 gun homicides 0.31 deaths per 100000 people and 253 gun suicides 3.29 deaths per 100000 people. Finland ranked fourth in international gun ownership rates with 45.3 guns per 100 people about 2400000 guns total. In 2007 Finland had 23 0.43 deaths per 100000 people gun homicides and 172 gun suicides 4.19 deaths per 100000 people. 44 45 The Second Amendment of the US Constitution reads A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.  Gun ownership is an American tradition older than the country itself and is protected by the Second Amendment more gun control laws would infringe upon the right to bear arms. Justice Antonin Scalia in the June 26 2008 District of Columbia et al. v. Heller U.S. Supreme Court majority opinion syllabus stated The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes such as selfdefense within the home. 3 The McDonald v. City of Chicago 2010 ruling also stated that the Second Amendment is an individual right. 51 Lawrence Hunter Chairman of Revolution PAC stated The Founders understood that the right to own and bear laws is as fundamental and as essential to maintaining liberty as are the rights of free speech a free press freedom of religion and the other protections against government encroachments on liberty delineated in the Bill of Rights. 52 The Second Amendment was intended to protect gun ownership of all ablebodied men so that they could participate in the militia to keep the peace and defend the country if needed. According to the United States Code a militia is composed of all ablebodied males at least 17 years of age under 45 years of age who are or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard. Therefore the militia mentioned in the Second Amendment would have been composed of almost all adult men and in turn that most adult men should not have their right to own firearms infringed. 99 100 Current gun control laws are frequently aimed at inner city poor black communities who are perceived as more dangerous than white gun owners. Charles Gallagher Chair of Sociology at LaSalle University stated that some gun control laws are still founded on racial fears Whites walking down Main Street with an AK47 are defenders of American values a black man doing the same thing is Public Enemy No. 1. 94 95 96 In the late 1960s gun control laws were enacted in reaction to the militant guncarrying Black Panthers. Adam Winkler UCLA Constitutional Law Professor stated The KKK began as a guncontrol organization. Before the Civil War blacks were never allowed to own guns so after the Civil War there was constant pressure among white racists to keep guns out of the hands of African Americans because they would rise up and revolt. For example in Virginia in response to Nat Turner s Rebellion also called the Southampton Rebellion in which enslaved people killed 55 to 65 people in the most fatal slave uprising in the United States in 1831 a law was passed that prohibited free black people to keep or carry any firelock of any kind any military weapon or any powder or lead and all laws allowing free black people to possess firearms were repealed. 97 98 Background checks and microstamping are an invasion of privacy. Background checks require government databases that keep personal individual information on gun owners including name addresses mental health history criminal records and more. The American Civil Liberties Union ACLU worried that Senator Harry Reid s 2013 proposed background check legislation the bill failed 5446 would have allowed the government to keep databases of gun purchases indefinitely creating a worry that you re going to see searches of the databases and an expansion for purposes that were not intended when the information was collected. Microstamping similarly requires a database of gun owners and the codes their personal guns would stamp on cartridge cases. Senators Rand Paul RKY Mike Lee RUT and Ted Cruz RTX wrote that they would oppose any legislation that infringes on the American people s constitutional right to bear arms or on their ability to exercise this right without being subjected to government surveillance. 77 78 79 80 Gun control laws infringe upon the right to selfdefense and deny people a sense of safety. The police cannot protect everyone all of the time. 61 of men and 56 of women surveyed by Pew Research said that stricter gun laws would make it more difficult for people to protect their homes and families. Nelson Lund Professor at George Mason University School of Law stated The right to selfdefense and to the means of defending oneself is a basic natural right that grows out of the right to life and many gun control laws interfere with the ability of lawabiding citizens to defend themselves against violent criminals. A Pew Foundation report found that 79 of male gun owners and 80 of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64 of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. Even Senator Dianne Feinstein a gun control advocate carried a concealed gun when her life was threatened and her home attacked by the New World Liberation Front in the 1970s. 58 59 64 Gun control laws especially those that try to ban assault weapons infringe upon the right to own guns for hunting and sport. In 2011 there were 13.7 million hunters 16 years old or older in the United States Highpowered semiautomatic rifles and shotguns are used to hunt and in target shooting tournaments each year. According to the National Shooting Sports Foundation Socalled Assault weapons are more often than not less powerful than other hunting rifles. The term assault weapon was conjured up by antigun legislators to scare voters into thinking these firearms are something out of a horror movie The Colt AR15 and Springfield M1A both labeled assault weapons are the rifles most used for marksmanship competitions in the United States. And their cartridges are standard hunting calibers useful for game up to and including deer. According to a Feb. 2013 Pew Research report 32 of gun owners owned guns for hunting and 7 owned guns for target or sport shooting. 55 65 66 67 68 Gun control efforts have proved ineffective. According to David Lampo Publications Director of the Cato Institute there is no correlation between waiting periods and murder or robbery rates. Banning highcapacity magazines will not necessarily deter crime because even small gun magazines can be changed in seconds.The gun show loophole is virtually nonexistent because commercial dealers who sell the majority of guns at shows and elsewhere are bound by strict federal laws. According to a Mar. 10 2016 Lancet study most statelevel gun control laws do not reduce firearm death rates and of 25 state laws nine were associated with higher gun death rates. 102 148 Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet in 2012 Mexico had 11309 gun murders 9.97 gun homicides per 100000 people compared to the United States that had 9146 gun homicides 2.97 per 100000 people. The country has only one legal gun store the Directorate of Arms and Munitions Sales compared to at least 63709 legal gun stores and pawn shops in the United States as of Feb. 10 2014. Mexico s gun store is on a secure military base and customers must present a valid ID go through a metal detector and turn over cellphones and cameras to guards. To actually buy a gun customers have to show proof of honest income provide references pass a criminal background check prove any military duties were completed with honor and be fingerprinted and photographed. If allowed to purchase a gun the customer may buy only one gun choosing from only .38 caliber pistols or lower and one box of bullets. Between 2006 and 2010 Mexico s one gun shop sold 6490 guns yet as of 2012 Mexicans own about 15000000 guns or about 13.5 guns per 100 people. 44 88 89 90 91 92 93 The main reason gun control doesn t work is because laws will not prevent criminals from obtaining guns or breaking laws. Of 62 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2012 49 of the shooters used legally obtained guns. Collectively 143 guns were possessed by the killers with about 75 obtained legally. A Secret Service analysis found that of 24 mass shootings in 2019 at least 10 42 involved illegally possessed guns. 69 176 The logical conclusion is that gun control laws do not deter crime gun ownership deters crime. A study in Applied Economics Letters found that assault weapons bans did not significantly affect murder rates at the state level and states with restrictions on the carrying of concealed weapons had higher gunrelated murders. While gun ownership doubled in the twentieth century the murder rate decreased. Journalist John Stossel explained Criminals don t obey the law Without the fear of retaliation from victims who might be packing heat criminals in possession of these illegal weapons now have a much easier job As the saying goes If guns are outlawed only outlaws will have guns. 53 56 103 More gun control is not needed education about guns and gun safety is needed to prevent accidental gun deaths. 95 of all US gun owners believe that children should learn about gun safety. The Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers Institute Inc SAAMI stated Whether in the field at the range or in the home a responsible and knowledgeable gun owner is rarely involved in a firearms accident of any kind. According to Kyle Wintersteen Managing Editor of Guns and Ammo studies show that children taught about firearms and their legitimate uses by family members have much lower rates of delinquency than children in households without guns and children introduced to guns associate them with freedom security and recreation not violence. 82 85 15482 85 154 57 of people surveyed by Pew Research in Feb. 2013 said that gun control laws would give too much power to the government over the people. 58 The NRA s Wayne LaPierre stated if you look at why our Founding Fathers put it the Second Amendment there they had lived under the tyranny of King George and they wanted to make sure that these free people in this new country would never be subjugated again and have to live under tyranny. 75 Concurring Alex Jones radio host stated The Second Amendment isn t there for duck hunting it s there to protect us from tyrannical government and street thugs 1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms! 76 The Libertarian Party stated A responsible wellarmed and trained citizenry is the best protection against domestic crime and the threat of foreign invasion. Counsel for the NRA explains It is evident that the framers of the Constitution did not intend to limit the right to keep and bear arms to a formal military body or organized militia but intended to provide for an unorganized armed citizenry prepared to assist in the common defense against a foreign invader or a domestic tyrant. 86 87 Marco Rubio RFL US Senator speaking about gun control laws during his 2016 presidential campaign stated If God forbid ISIS visits our life our neighborhood our school any part of us the last thing standing the last line of defense could very well be our ability to protect ourselves. 149 Did You Know?1. A Pew Foundation report found that 79 of male gun owners and 80 of female gun owners said owning a gun made them feel safer and 64 of people living in a home in which someone else owns a gun felt safer. 582. The US General Accountability Office GAO estimated that 100 of deaths per year in which a child under 6 years old shoots and kills himherself or another child could be prevented by automatic childproof safety locks. 353. The Centers for Disease Control listed firearms as the 12 cause of all deaths between 1999 and 2015 representing 1.3 of total deaths. They were also the 1 method of death by homicide 67.3 of all homicides and by suicide 51.9 of all suicides. 44. Mexico has some of the strictest gun control laws in the world and yet in 2012 Mexico had 11309 gun murders 9.97 gun homicides per 100000 people compared to the United States that had 9146 gun homicides 2.97 per 100000 people. 88 895. Carrying a concealed handgun in public has been permitted in all 50 states since 2013 when Illinois became the last state to enact concealed carry legislation. 1016. Five women a day are killed by guns in America. A womans risk of being murdered increases 500 if a gun is present during a domestic dispute. 10 11 People who view this page may also like1.

https://www.gale.com/open-access/gun-control, Gun control is one of the most divisive issues in the United States and the disparities across the legal and illegal uses of firearms add complexity to this topic. Read the overview below to gain a balanced understanding of the issue and explore the previews of opinion articles that highlight many perspectives on gun regulation.  Access Through Your library  Gun Control. Opposing Viewpoints Online Collection Gale 2024. Gun control refers to legislation and regulations that limit the ownership of firearms restrict certain types of firearms or determine where they may be carried. In the United States gun control is a highly controversial topic that engenders debate surrounding public safety state and federal government oversight and individual rights. Supporters of gun control seek tighter restrictions on the sale and circulation of firearms to decrease the high incidence of gunrelated violence and deaths in the United States. Opponents argue Americans have a constitutional right to own and bear firearms. According to the Gun Violence Archive an independent research group providing nearrealtime data on gun violence there were more than thirtynine thousand firearmrelated deaths in the United States from January to November 2023. Among these 56 percent were suicides and 44 percent were homicides. More firearmrelated violence incidents in 2023 were unintentional 1388 and defensive 1045 than aggressive 583. Many Americans support the right to bear arms but also believe the government has the right to regulate firearms in the interest of public safety. Though there are differences along party lines a 2023 Gallup poll found that 56 percent of Americans believe gun control laws should be stricter and 12 percent believe they should be less strict. Gun rights groups such as the National Rifle Association NRA aim to prevent new gun control legislation and if possible roll back existing regulations. Since the late twentieth century the NRA has wielded significant political influence at the national and state levels especially among conservative politicians. In response gun control organizations such as Brady Giffords and Everytown for Gun Safety have lobbied for legislation that better regulates gun ownership such as requiring waiting periods background checks gun permits gun safety training and restrictions on the possession of assault weapons. The right to keep and bear arms is included as the Second Amendment to the US Constitution as part of the Bill of Rights ratified on December 15 1791. It states A well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. The precise meaning and purpose of the Second Amendment have been subjects of frequent debate in the early twentyfirst century. At the time it was enacted each state maintained a militia composed of ordinary citizens who served as parttime soldiers to protect settlers on land contested by Native Americans and defend against any attacks by foreign entities some of which still held territories later claimed by the United States. In addition some of the authors of the Second Amendment feared the federal government would use its standing army to force its will on the states and intended to protect the state militias right to take up arms against the federal government. Opponents of gun control interpret the Second Amendment as guaranteeing individual citizens a right to keep and bear arms often with little or no limitations. They assert the amendment protects the rights of the general population because colonial law required every household to possess arms and every white male of military age to be ready for selfdefense and military emergencies. Therefore by guaranteeing arms for the militia the amendment simultaneously guaranteed arms for every citizen. Opponents of gun control further maintain the term right of the people in the Second Amendment holds the same meaning as it does in the First Amendment which guarantees such individual liberties as the freedom of religion and freedom of assembly. Proponents of gun control debate some of these interpretations and argue that much has changed since the amendment was written. Some gun control supporters argue the amendment was meant to protect only a states right to arm citizens for the common defense not private citizens rights to possess and carry any firearm in any space. They also argue that according to the amendment such militias were well regulated meaning they were subject to state requirements concerning training firearms and periodic military exercises. The US Congress has created laws regarding gun regulations and the Supreme Court has ruled on several cases. The National Firearms Act NFA of 1934 was the countrys first major federal gun control legislation. The law required the registration of certain firearms imposed taxes on the sale and manufacture of firearms and restricted the sale and ownership of highrisk weapons such as machine guns. The Federal Firearms Act FFA of 1938 provided additional regulations requiring federal licenses for firearm manufacturers and dealers and prohibiting certain people from buying firearms. The Supreme Courts ruling in United States v. Miller 1939 upheld the NFA and set a precedent that the right to bear arms applied to citizens in active controlled state guard or militia units. The next major piece of federal firearms legislation was the Gun Control Act GCA of 1968 passed in the wake of the assassinations of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Senator Robert F. Kennedy. The GCA expanded both the NFA and the FFA. The law ended mailorder sales of all firearms and ammunition and banned the sale of guns to minors felons fugitives from justice people who use illegal drugs persons with mental illness and those dishonorably discharged from the armed forces. The Supreme Court bolstered controls when it upheld New Jerseys strict gun control law in Burton v. Sills 1969 and the federal ban on possession of firearms by felons in Lewis v. United States 1980. The Firearms Owners Protection Act of 1986 FOPA however eased many GCA restrictions. Opponents of gun control lauded FOPA for expanding where firearms could be sold and who could sell them but continued to object to prohibitions on the manufacture and possession of machine guns for civilian use. In 1989 the administration of President George H. W. Bush announced a permanent ban on importing assault rifles. With passage of the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act of 1994 also called the Federal Assault Weapons Ban Congress banned the manufacture and sale of specific assault weapons. The ban expired in 2004. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act of 1993 passed as an amendment to the GCA. The Brady Act addressed several key concerns of gun control proponents by requiring a fiveday waiting period for all handgun sales during which a background check would be run on all prospective purchasers. This provision expired in 1998 and was replaced by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS a database used to verify the eligibility of a buyer to possess a firearm. After several victims and families of victims of gun violence and others sued gun manufacturers and dealers whose weapons were used to commit a crime Congress passed the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act PLCAA and the Child Safety Lock Act of 2005. The first act limited the liability of gun manufacturers and dealers when their firearms were used in crimes. The second act required anyone licensed to transfer or sell firearms to provide gun storage or safety devices. During his 2020 presidential campaign Democratic candidate Joe Biden supported repeal of the PLCAA. Congress enacted the NICS Improvement Amendments Act in 2007. It was meant to improve failures in the NICS system which had allowed a shooter to acquire a gun despite a disqualifying mental health status that had not been submitted to NICS by the state of Virginia. The shooter killed thirtytwo people and himself on a Virginia college campus. Gun rights proponents have used legislation and the federal courts to challenge gun restrictions. The US Supreme Court ruled in District of Columbia v. Heller 2008 that the Second Amendment prohibits the federal government from making it illegal for private individuals to keep loaded handguns in their homes. It was the first Supreme Court decision to explicitly rule that the right to keep and bear arms is an individual right. The decision in McDonald v. Chicago 2009 clarified that state and local authorities cannot prohibit private individuals from keeping loaded handguns in their homes. However both decisions affirmed that the Second Amendment allows for limits on the types of arms that can be kept and how they are used. Together the Heller and McDonald decisions have been used as the basis for several city county and state bans on assault weapons and specific arms such as the AR15 rifle. Following a 2022 mass shooting during a Fourth of July parade in Chicago that killed six and injured dozens of people Illinois governor J. B. Pritzker signed into law the Protect Illinois Communities Act in January 2023. The law prohibits anyone from selling or distributing assault weapons throughout the state. The law immediately faced legal challenges from gun advocates but it was upheld twice by the Illinois Supreme Court in August 2023 and by a federal appeals court in November 2023. Ten other states including California New Jersey New York and Washington have a similar active ban as of late 2023. State and local laws regarding licensing registration and possession of firearms vary widely. For instance in some states a permit to carry a concealed weapon in public is only issued if the applicant demonstrates a need or meets safety and training requirements. In other states a concealed carry permit is guaranteed to any citizen legally allowed to own a weapon. Several courts have used the Heller and McDonald decisions as a basis to allow concealed carry of firearms. As of September 2023 twentyeight states allowed concealed carry without a permit. The Supreme Courts rulings in Heller and McDonald also provided precedents for its ruling in New York State Rifle Pistol Association Inc. NYSRPA v. Bruen 2022. In its decision the court deemed a 1911 New York state law that required applicants for concealed handgun permits to show proper cause or a special need for selfdefense rather than a general desire to protect oneself unconstitutional. The ruling was handed down in June 2022 less than two months after ten people were killed in a mass shooting in Buffalo New York drawing harsh criticism from the states governor and Immediate action by its legislature. In July 2022 Governor Kathy Hochul signed the Concealed Carry Improvement Act into law. Drafted in response to the courts decision the new law retained certain requirements for concealed carry permit holders strengthened background checks and increased safety and training requirements. The law also identified several sensitive locations as gunfree zones including schools polling places theaters places of worship government buildings and medical and health care facilities. Gaps in legislation can enable people to obtain guns who may not otherwise meet the legal requirements for purchase. The background check requirement for example can be avoided by purchasing firearms from an unlicensed seller who does not perform these checks. While referred to as the gun show loophole such sales can take place elsewhere including online. Temporary loans of firearms are typically allowed as are transfers of weapons that are inherited or given as gifts. While unlicensed gun transfers are acceptable within ones own state interstate sales are prohibited. Federal law and some states allow juveniles to purchase long guns such as rifles and shotguns from an unlicensed firearms dealer. Child safety advocates have long campaigned for federal legislation that would raise the minimum age to own any type of firearm and have also called for regulations aimed at preventing children from accessing guns in the home. In October 2023 a study published in the journal Pediatrics named firearmrelated injuries as the leading cause of death among US children. An amendment passed in 1996 known as the Lautenberg Amendment prevents people who have been convicted of domestic abuse or are the subject of a protective order prohibiting contact from owning guns. However abusers who are not a parent guardian or legal spouse to their victims face no such restrictions. A provision intended to narrow this gap known as the boyfriend loophole was included in the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed into law by President Biden in June 2022. Underreporting and underfunding of NICS have contributed to lapses in data that resulted in multiple instances of weapons sales to unauthorized persons who then used the weapons to commit crimes. For example following an incident in which a former member of the US Air Force killed twentysix people at a church in Sutherland Springs Texas the Air Force acknowledged they had failed to report the shooters military courtmartial conviction for domestic violence to civilian authorities. In response Congress passed the Fix NICS Act of 2017 to penalize federal agencies that do not meet NICS reporting requirements. In 2015 a gunman shot and killed nine Black worshippers at a Charleston South Carolina church. Authorities later discovered the perpetrator had purchased the murder weapon while his background check was still pending because firearms sales are allowed to proceed by default if the check takes more than three days. The House of Representatives passed a bill in 2021 to extend background checks from three days to ten days allowing more time for a full check to be completed. Known as the Charleston loophole bill as of November 2023 the Senate had not voted on the legislation. Several mass shootings occurred during the presidency of Barack Obama including the murders of twentyseven children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012 and fortynine people at a Florida nightclub in 2016. Congressional inaction led Obama to issue executive orders that expanded background checks to cover firearms sold at gun shows and online sought more federal agents to process background checks advocated greater use of smartgun technology and required states to provide more information on people disqualified from purchasing guns. The subsequent Donald Trump administration rescinded the last order. The largest mass shooting in US history in which sixty people were killed in Las Vegas in 2017 and the February 2018 shooting of fourteen students and three staff members at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida renewed debate over access to assault weapons. Student survivors of the massacre joined other gun control advocates in calling for reform. In March 2018 the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act was signed into law in Florida. The law placed some limits on gun sales while expanding resources for law enforcement and safety personnel. Later the same month a group of survivors and student activists organized a nationwide school walkout alongside the March for Our Lives to voice their demands for gun control legislative reform. An estimated one to two million people participated. Leading up to the 2020 elections lobbying organizations and political groups again invested substantial amounts of money in political campaigns to elect candidates favorable to their stance on gun control. For example the NRA gun rights lobbying group alone spent approximately 28.5 million to back the political campaigns of Republican candidates during the 2020 election cycle. Gun control groups such as Everytown for Gun Safety and Giffords collectively spent about 21.6 million in support of Democratic candidates in 2020. In 2021 and 2022 with congressional action on gun control unlikely President Joe Biden also issued a series of executive orders. Bidens orders focused on regulating specific types of firearms and gun modifications funding research on firearms trafficking in the United States and encouraging states to pass red flag laws. Red flag laws allow for the temporary removal of firearms from a person identified as a potential danger by law enforcement or family members who can petition for a court order. Bidens executive orders also affirmed the federal governments jurisdiction in regulating the sale of firearmbuilding kits bought through private sellers online and assembled at home. Referred to as ghost guns these firearms do not have serial numbers and are untraceable. The US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF issued revised rules clarifying that ghost guns must comply with all federal laws related to firearm sales. In October 2023 the Supreme Court blocked a lower court ruling that would have prevented ATF from enforcing the new rules. Following backtoback mass shootings in Buffalo New York and Uvalde Texas in May 2022 that killed a total of thirtyone people citizens criticism of federal inaction on gun control once again intensified leading to the passage of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act of 2022. President Biden signed the bill the first major gun control legislation in nearly thirty years into law two days after the Supreme Courts decision in NYSRPA v. Bruen was released. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act does not go as far as instituting universal background checks or banning assault weapons but it contains multiple provisions intended to strengthen the background check system. For instance the law takes steps to close the boyfriend loophole and institutes a more thorough background check process for buyers under age twentyone. In addition the new law requires all people who earn a profit from selling guns to register as licensed dealers while previous regulations required licensing only for people who sold guns as their principal means of income. Bringing internet and gun show sellers under federal licensure will require they run background checks through NICS and may be a significant step toward closing the gun show loophole. In September 2023 President Biden announced the creation of the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention which aims to execute and build upon important legislation and government initiatives aimed at reducing gun violence in the United States. In October however the United States experienced the thirtysixth and worst mass shooting of the year when a gunman killed at least eighteen people and injured at least thirteen in two towns in Maine.  The left almost always opposes fighting evil and almost always works to disarm the good who want to fight.  Dennis Prager is a syndicated conservative radio host and a columnist for the Daily Signal. He is the author of several books including Still the Best Hope Why the World Needs American Values to Triumph. In the following viewpoint Prager argues that the government should provide public school teachers with firearms and training to reduce the number of casualties in a mass shooting. The author collectively identifies people who oppose this idea as the left and depicts them as enablers of violence. Citing examples over the past century the author contends that people who advocate for gun control and promote nonviolence have allowed terrorism and human rights abuses to flourish. Prager criticizes gun control advocates and their associates for squandering their energies on issues less important to society than national security.  The more teachers think of students as threats to be assessed the less educators will think of students as individuals to nourish and cultivate.  Bryan Warnick is a professor and associate dean in the College of Education and Human Ecology at Ohio State University Benjamin A. Johnson is an assistant professor at Utah Valley University and Sam Rocha is an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. In the following viewpoint the authors argue that schools risk alienating students by implementing excessive security measures. By installing invasive technologies and instituting strict policies the authors contend school officials encourage a perception of the school as a dangerous place that does not facilitate learning. Additionally the authors express concern that the fortification of schools encourages teachers and students to be suspicious rather than supportive of each other. The authors encourage a reevaluation of school culture. Further they contend schools need to create opportunities for students to be able to express themselves and assert their social status in productive nonviolent ways.  The political courage and leadership of the young people in Florida who took on the gun lobby this week stands in the storied inspiring tradition of youth activism in America and beyond.  Gary Younge is the editoratlarge for the Guardian and columnist for the Nation. He is the author of several books including Stranger in a Strange Land Encounters in the Disunited States. In the following viewpoint Younge commends the ability of young people to advocate for social change but warns that social movements will not be successful if they are entirely dependent on youths. Younge applies his argument to the student survivors of the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida who have called on lawmakers to pass gun control legislation to prevent mass shootings. Comparing the youth gun control advocates to adults calling for similar reforms Younge contends that the student activists have been able to draw attention to lawmakers inaction surrounding gun violence in a way that adults have repeatedly failed. However Younge maintains the likelihood of meaningful change depends on adults building upon the momentum created by the student activists.  The adults understand even if the children do not that the larger goal is the disarmament of free people whose insistence upon individual liberty has no place in the new progressive political order.  Jeffrey T. Brown is an insurance and personal injury attorney in Bowie Maryland and a contributor to the American Thinker. In the following viewpoint Brown argues that lawmakers should avoid being swayed by victims of gun violence and resist passing gun legislation in the immediate wake of a national tragedy such as the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland Florida. The author contends that gun control advocates frequently use mass shootings as opportunities to push their political agenda. Further he asserts gun control groups exploit the victims of gun violence and use them to evoke an emotional response from the public. Dismissing the calls for gun control raised by the student survivors of the 2018 shooting Brown argues that the students personal experiences with gun violence do not qualify them to make decisions regarding gun rights.

https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/what-science-tells-us-about-the-effects-of-gun-policies.html,  Photo by ARTYuSTUDIOAdobe Stock Good public policies are based on facts and data and the most effective laws including gun laws are written when policymakers understand the effects of such laws on a range of outcomes and can weigh the inherent tradeoffs. For gun policies relevant outcomes can include among others the health of the gun industry individuals ability to defend themselves and homicide and suicide rates. In other words policymakers need to understand the costs and benefits that different policies are likely to produce for society as a whole including gun owners communities wracked by violence and other affected groups. This is not to say that all lawmakers need is an understanding of the true effects of policies. There are many other considerations as well such as whether policies are consistent with Second Amendment protections or might infringe on other rights. Nevertheless understanding the true effects of policies on a variety of outcomes is essential to creating policies that are both fair and effective. Learn more about the guidelines and steps used in our review of gun policy research  As part of the RAND Gun Policy in America initiative we conducted rigorous and transparent reviews of what current scientific knowledge could tell the public and policymakers about the true effects of many gun policies that are frequently discussed in state legislatures. Our first such review released in 2018 synthesized the available scientific data from studies published between 2004 and 2016 examining how 13 classes of statelevel gun policies affect firearmrelated deaths violent crime the gun industry participation in hunting and sport shooting and other outcomes. In 2020 we released an expanded and updated review which added five new classes of gun policies and extended the period over which we conducted our literature search to span from 1995 to 2018. Another update expanding the literature search to include studies published through 2020 was released in 2023. With continued growth in the number of new scientific publications on gun policy we incorporate those studies in our updated analyses in several areas drawing new or revised conclusions about the quality of evidence available to support claims about the effects of various policies. We restricted our analyses to only those studies using methods designed to identify possible causal effects of the policies. For instance studies that reported simple correlations between gun policies and various outcomes at a single point in time did not meet our inclusion criteria because such studies provide no evidence that it is the gun policy itself that explains the outcome differences rather than other social demographic or historical differences between jurisdictions with and without those policies. However even among the research studies that met our criteria of using methods more appropriate for establishing the causal effects of gun policies the methodological quality of studies varies. A team of RAND methodologists analyzed the methodological quality of each individual study and then applied standardized and explicit criteria for determining the strength of the evidence provided by the body of research regarding the effect of each policy. We categorized the scientific evidence on a relativistic scale shown below.  After reviewing several thousand candidate studies we identified 152 that met our inclusion criteria. These studies provided evidence for 52 of the 144 main policy effects we set out to examine that is the effects of each of the 18 policies on each of the eight main outcomes. We concluded that there was some evidence of an increase or decrease on an outcome for 15 of the policy effects there was inconclusive evidence for 37 additional effects and there were no qualifying studies that had evaluated any of the remaining effects 92. The table below summarizes the strength of evidence and direction increase or decrease of the effects that the scientific literature currently provides with links to detailed syntheses of the available research. There is inconclusive evidence for how extreme risk protection orders affect suicide. There is inconclusive evidence for how extreme risk protection orders affect violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements affect mass shootings. There is moderate evidence that minimum age requirements for purchasing a firearm decrease firearm suicides among young people. There is inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements affect unintentional injuries and deaths. There is inconclusive evidence for how minimum age requirements affect violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how prohibitions associated with domestic violence affect mass shootings. There is inconclusive evidence for how prohibitions associated with domestic violence affect suicide. There is moderate evidence that prohibitions associated with domestic violence decrease intimate partner homicides. There is inconclusive evidence for how prohibitions associated with mental illness affect suicide. There is limited evidence that prohibitions associated with mental illness decrease violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how surrender of firearms by prohibited possessors affect mass shootings. There is moderate evidence that surrender of firearms with expanded classes of prohibited possessors decreases firearminvolved intimate partner homicides. There is inconclusive evidence for how background checks affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how background checks affect mass shootings. There is inconclusive evidence for how background checks affect suicide. There is moderate evidence that background checks decrease total homicides and firearm homicides. There is inconclusive evidence for how bans of lowquality handguns affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how bans of lowquality handguns affect suicide. There is inconclusive evidence for how bans of lowquality handguns affect violent crime. There is limited evidence that bans on the sale of assault weapons and highcapacity magazines increase prices or sales of banned firearms in the short term. There is limited evidence that bans on highcapacity magazines decrease mass shootings and fatalities. There is inconclusive evidence for how bans on the sale of assault weapons and highcapacity magazines affect suicide. There is inconclusive evidence for how bans on the sale of assault weapons and highcapacity magazines affect violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how firearm safety training requirements affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how firearm safety training requirements affect violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how firearm sales reporting recording and registration requirements affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how firearm sales reporting recording and registration requirements affect mass shootings. There is inconclusive evidence for how licensing and permitting requirements affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how licensing and permitting requirements affect mass shootings. There is limited evidence that licensing and permitting requirements decrease total and firearm suicides among adults. There is inconclusive evidence for how licensing and permitting requirements affect violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how waiting periods affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how waiting periods affect mass shootings. There is moderate evidence that waiting periods decrease firearm suicides. There is moderate evidence that waiting periods decrease total homicides. There is inconclusive evidence for how childaccess prevention laws affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how childaccess prevention laws affect mass shootings. There is supportive evidence that childaccess prevention laws decrease firearm suicides among young people. There is supportive evidence that childaccess prevention laws decrease unintentional firearm injuries and deaths for children. There is supportive evidence that childaccess prevention laws decrease firearm homicides or firearm assault injuries among young people. There is inconclusive evidence for how concealedcarry laws affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how concealedcarry laws affect mass shootings. There is inconclusive evidence for how concealedcarry laws affect suicide. There is inconclusive evidence for how concealedcarry laws affect unintentional injuries and deaths. There is supportive evidence that concealedcarry laws increase total homicides and firearm homicides. There is inconclusive evidence for how gunfree zones affect violent crime. There is inconclusive evidence for how standyourground laws affect defensive gun use. There is inconclusive evidence for how standyourground laws affect gun industry outcomes. There is inconclusive evidence for how standyourground laws affect mass shootings. There is inconclusive evidence for how standyourground laws affect suicide. There is supportive evidence that standyourground laws increase firearm homicides. Across all of the 18 policies that we examined only three childaccess prevention laws concealed carry laws and standyourground laws had evidence that we classified as supportive our highest evidence rating for an effect on a particular outcome. Specifically there is supportive evidence that childaccess prevention laws reduce firearm selfinjuries including suicides firearm homicides or assault injuries and unintentional firearm injuries and deaths among youth. In addition we found supportive evidence that standyourground laws increase firearm homicides and supportive evidence that shallissue concealed carry laws increase total and firearm homicides. Notably all three of these types of laws differ from many of the other policies we considered in our analysis. Most of the other policies affect either the small proportion of guns that are newly acquired every year e.g. background checks waiting periods or a relatively small proportion of gun owners e.g. prohibitions that target the mentally ill or domestic violence offenders. The three laws for which we found stronger evidence in contrast influence how the existing stock of gun owners can legally store carry or use their firearms. With such large numbers of guns potentially affected these laws may have greater chances of producing observable effects in populationlevel statistics than other types of laws.  Our conclusions for concealed carry laws differ from those in our previous review of the research which found only inconclusive evidence for the effect of such laws on total and firearm homicides. However eight new studies meeting our inclusion criteria have since been published and all but one of these studies suggest that less restrictive concealed carry permitting laws elevate homicide rates one finds uncertain effects. Given the effect sizes and evidence that concealed carry permit holders are rarely convicted for violent crimes e.g. Texas Department of Public Safety 2022 Minnesota Department of Public Safety 2022 it is unlikely that increased homicides perpetrated by legal concealed carry permit holders represent a substantive mechanism driving these effects. However widespread behavioral changes associated with morepermissive concealedcarry laws such as increased prevalence of handgun carrying e.g. RowhaniRahbar et al. 2017 may have unintended consequences that could explain the association of these laws with increased homicides. For instance it could be that as more people carry firearms there are more opportunities for these firearms to be stolen and thereafter enter criminal firearm markets e.g. see Donohue et al. 2022. Conceivably as more lawabiding citizens carry weapons others who may be higherrisk and prohibited from possessing a firearm become more likely to carry guns illegally. Again these are candidate theories that may or may not explain the observed effects of these laws. More research is needed to understand the true mechanisms driving these effects particularly considering changes to concealedcarry legislation in response to the 2022 Supreme Court decision in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen. We found moderate evidence our secondhighest evidence rating that background check requirements reduce total and firearm homicides. Most of the studies in this area examined the effects of dealer background checks or the combined effects of dealer and privateseller background checks when both are required by a state. We found moderate evidence that dealer background checks reduce firearm homicides and moderate evidence that background checks on both dealer and private sales universal background checks reduce total homicides. In prior editions of this review research evidence favored the conclusion that dealer background checks reduced homicide rates but evidence of the effects of extending these checks to include private sales was inconclusive. Since then new studies suggest that background checks on private sales may also reduce homicides. We also found moderate evidence that minimum age of purchase laws reduce firearm suicides waiting periods reduce rates of firearm suicide and total homicide and that some gun possession prohibitions associated with domestic violence reduce intimate partner homicides. View the strength of evidence for relationships between gun policies and outcomes and read the analysis that went into determining those conclusions.  We found evidence that several other policies increase or decrease one of the outcomes examined. To view detailed syntheses of the research that led to each of these findings as well as the evidence that we categorized as inconclusive click on the associated box in the table above.  Despite these findings a large majority of the effects for which we sought scientific evidence have not been investigated with sufficient rigor to be included in our review. Indeed we found no studies examining the effects of any of the 18 policy types on police shootings or on hunting and recreation outcomes just three studies examining how the policies affect defensive gun use and relatively few studies evaluating effects of the policies on gun industry outcomes. These are all outcomes that are frequently raised as concerns in gun policy debates. Because there is little empirical research examining these outcomes policymakers have limited ability to use evidence to comprehensively consider how laws are likely to affect different interests. While there is a growing and increasingly robust literature on the effects of many gun laws on several outcomes there remains a highly limited base of rigorous scientific evidence concerning the effects of many commonly discussed gun policies. Importantly however where we conclude that evidence for a policy is weak that does not mean that the policy is ineffective the policy itself might well be quite effective. The absence of evidence about a law can result from the law not having been studied or studied well which may reflect shortcomings in the contributions that science has made to policy debate the absence of available data on key outcomes or a variety of other methodological challenges facing gun policy evaluation researchers. Weaker evidence may also partly reflect the policies we chose to investigate all of which have been implemented in some U.S. states and so have proven to be politically and legally feasible at least in some jurisdictions. This decision meant that none of the policies we examined would dramatically increase or decrease the stock of guns estimated by the Small Arms Survey to be more than 393 million firearms in 2017 or gun ownership rates with about onethird of households estimated to own firearms in 2016 in ways that may produce more readily detectable effects on public safety health and industry outcomes.  Even a 1percent reduction in homicides nationally would correspond to approximately 2500 fewer deaths over a decade.  Still even relatively small effects of gun policies are important to the people and communities affected. Even a 1percent reduction in homicides nationally would correspond to approximately 2500 fewer deaths over a decade.  By highlighting where scientific evidence is accumulating we hope to build consensus around a shared set of facts that have been established through a transparent nonpartisan and impartial review process. In so doing we also mean to highlight areas where more and better information could make important contributions to establishing fair and effective gun policies.  View the full project bibliography

Gun rights activists in Texas where it s legal to carry guns openly in most public places Last month a gunman opened fire in the baggage claim of the airport in Fort Lauderdale Florida. The shooter was later identified as an Army veteran who had sought help for mental illness. He killed five people. The deadly shooting reignited a longstanding debate about firearms in the United States. The U.S. has more guns and gun deaths than any other developed country.  As firearms have become more powerful and mass shootings fill the news arguments over gun laws have grown more heated. Some people say that we need stricter laws to limit the kinds of guns that are legal to own and make it harder for criminals to get weapons. These kinds of restrictions are known as gun control.  Opponents of such measures say that most guncontrol laws violate the right to bear arms that the Framers laid out in the Second Amendment to the Constitution. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that this amendment protects a person s right to keep a loaded firearm for selfdefense.  Congress hasn t passed major guncontrol legislation in two decades. President Donald Trump has said he would oppose any new guncontrol measures. He favors expanding gun owners rights. Does the U.S. need tougher guncontrol laws? Two experts weigh in. We lose more than 36000 Americans to gun violence every year in this country. That s an average of 99 gun deaths a day. These tragedies range from accidents and suicides to horrific mass shootings like the one at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando Florida last June.  No other democracy in the world experiences this level of gun violence. That s because other free nations have tough gun laws to deal with this problem.  It s estimated that Americans own more than 300 million guns. Guns certainly do not cause crime but the fact that they are so easily available does make crimes more deadly. Simply put when more people have guns the odds go up that those guns will be used.  We lose more than 36000 Americans to gun violence every year. We re all tired of reading stories about shooters who passed background checks and legally purchased firearms despite histories of violent behavior severe mental illness and substance abuse. And that s when background checks are required. A new survey found that 22 percent of gun owners recently bought a firearm through a private sale. Such sales do not require a background check and are legal in more than 30 states. That gives dangerous people a free pass to arm themselves. We need tougher gun laws across the board but a logical place to start is with the enactment of a federal law requiring background checks on all gun sales. Those checks should also be strengthened to block all those with a history of violence.  The United States is known for accomplishing extraordinary things. Never let anyone tell you that we can t save the lives we re losing to gun violence. We can and we must.  Ladd EverittDirector One Pulse for America a gun violence prevention group On July 24 2014 a doctor used his concealed handgun to disable a gunman who had begun firing in a hospital in Darby Pennsylvania. One hospital worker had been killed. Police said that if the doctor had not been armed many more innocent people would have died.  As for the gunman not only did he ignore the hospital s no weapons policy he had both a mental and a criminal record that disqualified him from possessing firearms under federal law.  And that is precisely the problem Gun control has consistently failed to keep bad guys from getting firearms. Guncontrol advocates claim that we just need tougher laws. But with thousands of pages of failed gun laws already on the books it s highly unrealistic to think that enacting more restrictions will work any better.  People are using guns to save a life more often than to take a life. In 2003 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC examined dozens of gun and ammunition bans waiting periods and background checks. After analyzing all these restrictions the CDC concluded that the evidence was insufficient to determine the effectiveness of any of these guncontrol laws.  The CDC examined the issue again in 2013 and reported that there are between 500000 and  3 million annual cases of guns being used for selfdefense. This means that people are using guns to save a life 16 to 100 times more often than to take a life. In 2008 the Supreme Court ruled on the right to keep and bear arms which is protected by the Second Amendment to the Constitution. The Court correctly noted that this right belongs to all Americans. We should reject additional restrictions on this important right.  Erich PrattExecutive Director Gun Owners of America CORE QUESTION What evidence does each writer use to support his claim?

Our editors will review what you ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. gun control politics legislation and enforcement of measures intended to restrict access to the possession of or the use of arms particularly firearms. Gun control is one of the most controversial and emotional issues in many countries with the debate often centring on whether regulations on an individual s right to arms are an undue restriction on liberty and whether there is a correlation between guns and crime. Proponents of guncontrol legislation assert that the strict enforcement of guncontrol laws saves lives and reduces crime. By contrast opponents of gun control assert that minimal restrictions on guns ensure that individuals have adequate means for selfdefense and that a wider distribution of firearms results in safer communities. Gun control is an issue throughout the world with each country having the sovereign authority to regulate firearms within its borders. The vast majority of industrialized countries have strict guncontrol regulations. For example Japan places restrictions on the possession and use of all firearms except in limited instances e.g. hunting athletic events and research. Canada permits the possession and use of firearms for competitions and target practice but it forbids the possession of handguns unless an individual can show that a handgun is needed for selfdefense. The United Kingdom has banned handguns altogether and limits the possession of firearms to activities such as hunting target shooting pest control and slaughtering. Meanwhile Germany permits the ownership of certain firearms so long as an individual meets the requirements for a firearms ownership license which include that the applicant be age 18 or older and have expert knowledge in the handling of firearms and have the necessity to possess such firearms. If gun control is defined as placing legal restrictions on arms to protect civil society its origins can be traced back to ancient Rome. In Rome arms were seen as the means to maintain standing armies. To prevent these armies from undermining and overthrowing civil authority Roman law forbade military arms from crossing the Rubicon. This law would remain in effect until Julius Caesar violated it when he maintained a standing army to assume power as emperor of Rome a historical event that was etched as the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire. In fact this historical event is of such significance that both the English Bill of Rights formally An Act Declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject and Settling the Succession of the Crown 1689 and the U.S. Constitution 1789 include provisions that prevent the maintenance of standing armies during times of peace without the consent of the legislative branch. In England arms were always controlled by Parliament and the crown according to socioeconomic status. As English reformer and MP John Sadler wrote in 1649 in his pamphlet titled The Rights of the Kingdom Men ought indeed have Arms and them to keep in Readiness for Defence of the King and Kingdom but Parliament defined which men were to provide and bear arms how and when and where. It should be emphasized that arms were primarily seen as tools for the common defense of the realm. Even for this purpose however arms were strictly regulated by the government to ensure that they were readily available for the common defense and were out of the hands of dangerous persons. For example during the reign of Henry VIII 1509 47 restrictions were placed on weapons and defensive armour being brought to any town church market or other congregation except upon the hue and cry a practice whereby criminals were pursued with cries and sounds of alarm. Henry VIII had enacted other guncontrol laws including restrictions on the length of guns on who was qualified to possess guns and on when and where they may be fired. Gun restrictions in England were rarely the subject of parliamentary debate. However from the mid17th to the late 18th century members of Parliament periodically proposed laws that would remove gun restrictions and allow English householders to have and maintain guns for the defense of the realm. For instance during the convention in 1689 that drafted the English Declaration of Rights Thomas Erle who had served as a general and was a member of Parliament proposed that every substantial householder in any town or city should be provided of a good musket in case of invasion. In 1693 a similar proposal was made to allow every Protestant to keep a musket for the security of the government. Such proposals failed however because they would arm the mob and thus were considered not very safe for any government.  Naturally the safety of the government was not the only reason restrictions on guns were imposed in England. Guncontrol restrictions sometimes supported the hunting of game or the access of hunters to game preserves as well as to prevent crime and murders. In the 1750s the Scottish philosopher and historian Adam Ferguson opposed such restrictions as preventing the establishment of a national militia because although a few domestic inconveniences would occur this should not deter us from the necessary Steps in arming the people for our own Defence against a foreign Enemy. The English writer and MP Soame Jenyns also justified the removal of gun restrictions to further the establishment of a national militia. Although Accidents such as murder may sometimes happen it did not matter he argued because every man in the militia will beget three Children before he kills one Man.  In the end neither of these arguments affected the wellestablished gun restrictions in England. In fact when mid18th century militia reform was finally adopted George II 1727 60 ensured that all militia arms were kept by local lord lieutenants and only distributed during times of militia muster and training. This was a practice that dated to the 1550s during the reign of Mary I when the law required that all guns and arms in cities boroughs towns parishes and hamlets were to be kept by local government officials and in places of safekeeping.
https://news.gallup.com/poll/513623/majority-continues-favor-stricter-gun-laws.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Gallup s latest update on Americans opinions on gun laws finds a majority continuing to favor strengthening those laws. Fiftysix percent of U.S. adults say gun laws should be stricter while 31 believe they should be kept as they are now and 12 favor less strict gun laws. These attitudes collected before last week s mass shooting in Lewiston Maine are unchanged from a year ago but they reflect less support for stricter laws than in June 2022 66 after the Uvalde Texas school shooting. Majorities have consistently favored stricter gun laws since 2015 with notable spikes in that view after prominent shootings such as in Uvalde and Parkland Florida in 2018. Gallup first asked Americans about their preferences for gun laws using the current wording in 1990. Since then majorities have typically called for stricter laws including a high of 78 in the initial September 1990 measurement amid heightened concern about crime and ongoing congressional debate over the Brady Bill handgun legislation which ultimately passed in 1993. The exceptions to majoritylevel support for stricter laws occurred between 2008 and 2014 when between 43 and 49 favored tougher laws with that trend temporarily interrupted by a December 2012 58 reading conducted shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The pattern of increased support for stricter gun laws after prominent shootings suggests that a higher proportion than the 56 measured in the Oct. 223 poll would favor tougher laws if measured today in the wake of the Oct. 25 Lewiston shootings. An Army reservist killed 18 people in shootings at two locations in the Maine town. While Americans do want gun laws tightened they also do not favor a ban on handguns for ordinary citizens something Gallup has asked about since 1959. Just 27 of U.S. adults believe that no one outside of police or other authorized persons should be able to possess a handgun. The current figure is on the lower end of what Gallup has measured historically including 60 who favored a ban in 1959 and roughly four in 10 Americans in most surveys conducted between 1975 and 1993. The low point of 19 favoring a ban came in an October 2021 survey. Opposition to a handgun ban is consistent with Americans belief that having guns makes people s homes safer rather than more dangerous. Currently 64 believe guns make homes safer while 32 believe they make them more dangerous. Public opinion on this issue has shifted over time. When Gallup first asked this version of the question in 2000 a slim majority of 51 believed guns made homes more dangerous places to live. Americans views were evenly divided in 2004 and 2006 but by 2014 the majority had come to believe that guns made homes safer. Opinions have held steady since then. As might be expected the overwhelming majority of those with a gun in their household 86 believe guns make homes safer just 12 disagree. Among those living in households without guns opinion is divided 45 believe they are safer and 49 more dangerous places to live with guns present. Democrats overwhelmingly believe gun laws should be made stricter and believe guns make homes more dangerous. They are also much more likely than Republicans to favor a handgun ban. In contrast Republicans generally want gun laws kept as they are now and believe guns make homes safer. Independents side with Democrats on wanting stricter gun laws but they are closer to Republicans in believing guns increase home safety rather than decrease it. Today s partisan differences on guns contrast with relatively modest gaps two decades ago. Fortyfour percent of U.S. adults say they have a gun in their home or on their property with 30 saying the gun belongs to them personally and the remainder saying it belongs to another household member. These percentages are steady compared with recent years although Gallup measured higher rates of household gun possession between 50 and 53 in the early 1990s. Gun ownership rates have increased among Republicans over the past two decades 45 of Republicans say they personally own a gun and 58 live in a gun household. In 2000 the figures were 32 and 48 respectively. Among independents ownership rates are similar to what they were in 2000 with 29 personally owning a gun and 43 living in a gun household. Democratic gun ownership has declined slightly. Now 18 of Democrats say they personally own a gun and 29 live in a gun household compared with 23 and 36 respectively in 2000. The new poll confirms prior years finding that U.S. gun owners typically have more than one gun. Currently 29 of Americans who have a gun in their household report having one gun while 33 say they have between two and four guns and 22 have five or more. Sixteen percent of respondents from gun households would not disclose how many guns they own. On seven other occasions since 1993 Gallup has asked those with guns to say how many guns their household owns. In each of those surveys majorities of 59 or greater have said their household had multiple guns. But gun owners may now be owning more total guns than in the past. U.S. adults with a gun in their household say their house has an average of 4.9 guns. In prior surveys the average number of guns owned ranged between 4.0 and 4.5. However because of smaller sample sizes of gun owners in each survey and a large variation in the reported number of guns the current estimate is not significantly higher than past measures from a statistical perspective. The gun issue has played a major role in U.S. political debate in recent years and each mass shooting such as the one that occurred in Maine last week returns the issue to the forefront. Though the two major U.S. political parties are increasingly divided on the issue Americans as a whole have been largely consistent in wanting gun laws to be stricter but also opposing a handgun ban. Their views on whether guns make homes safer or more dangerous have shifted with a solid majority now believing guns make homes safer. Last year in response to the Uvalde shooting Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation designed to address gun violence which was hailed as the first major federal legislation on the issue in decades. The legislation expanded background checks on gun purchases for young adults increased mental health funding expanded prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence and created incentives for states to pass red flag laws. However Americans apparently did not see those steps as going far enough to prevent gun violence with no decrease since the law was signed in the percentage wanting laws to be tougher. That could reflect that Americans favor a number of proposals that have been offered as antidotes to gun violence including longer waiting periods for gun purchases and an assault weapons ban that were not included in the legislation.

https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/06/28/views-of-u-s-gun-laws-impact-of-gun-ownership-on-safety/, This question highlights the sharp contrasts between partisans over the role of guns in society 79 of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents say that gun ownership does more to increase safety while a nearly identical share of Democrats and Democratic leaners 78 say that it does more to decrease safety. Gun owners and nonowners also are divided. Among the 32 of adults who say they personally own a gun 71 say that gun ownership increases safety. Among the 65 of adults who do not own a gun just 37 say the same. A majority of nonowners 61 say that gun ownership does more to decrease safety. There are also large divisions among Americans based on community type. Among those who say they live in urban areas 64 say gun ownership makes people less safe while 34 say it does more to increase safety. Among those who live in rural areas these shares are roughly reversed 65 say gun ownership does more to increase safety compared with 33 who say it does more to decrease safety. Those who report living in suburban areas are about as likely to say that gun ownership increases safety 51 as to say it decreases safety 47. About half of Americans 49 say they live in suburban areas while roughly a quarter report living in either rural 26 or urban areas 24. For more on selfreported community type read our publication Evaluating what makes a U.S. community urban suburban or rural.  Views on whether gun laws in the United States should be stricter less strict or are about right have fluctuated modestly in recent years. Currently 58 say gun laws should be stricter while 26 say laws are about right and 15 say they should be less strict. Two years ago 53 favored stricter gun laws. In 2019 60 said laws should be stricter. Demographic differences in views of gun policy have been stable in recent years. A majority of women 64 say that gun laws should be stricter than they are today compared with 51 of men. Roughly threequarters of Black 77 and Asian adults 74 say this compared with 68 of Hispanic adults and 51 of White adults. Younger adults are somewhat more likely to support stricter gun laws than older adults though majorities across age groups favor stricter laws. There also are educational divides on this issue 72 of adults with a postgraduate education say that gun laws should be stricter compared with 52 of adults with a high school degree or less formal education. As in recent years Republicans who identify as moderate or liberal are more likely to favor stricter gun laws than those who describe themselves as conservatives. Roughly fourinten moderate or liberal Republicans 42 say that laws should be stricter while 40 say current laws are about right and 17 say they should be less strict. Among conservative Republicans just 19 say laws should be stricter while 33 say they should be less strict and 48 say current laws are about right. Large majorities of Democrats across ideological groups say that gun laws should be stricter than they are today 92 of liberal Democrats and 81 of conservative or moderate Democrats say this. Americans who live in urban communities are substantially more likely than those who live in rural communities to favor stricter gun laws. People who don t own guns are about twice as likely as gun owners to say that gun laws should be stricter 71 of nonowners say this compared with 35 of gun owners. By contrast gun owners are roughly twice as likely as nonowners to say that current laws are about right 39 vs. 20 and about three times as likely to say that gun laws should be less strict 26 vs. 8. Within each party there are divisions in the opinions of those who own guns and those who do not. Roughly fourinten Republicans who don t own guns 41 say that gun laws should be stricter compared with just 15 of Republican gun owners. Republican gun owners are more likely than nonowners to say that current laws are about right 49 vs. 41 or that they should be less strict 35 vs. 17. While large majorities of Democratic gun owners 73 say that laws should be stricter Democrats who don t own guns overwhelmingly hold this view 89.
