https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/assault-weapons-large-magazines/, Second Amendment Firearms that gun control supporters call assault weapons and ammunition magazines that they call large are among the arms protected by the Second Amendment. Because they re among the arms that are most useful for the entire range of defensive purposes they re in common use for defensive purposes a standard articulated by the Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller 2008.8 This is true regardless of which of gun control supporters everexpanding definitions of assault weapons one uses.9 In 2015 Heller decision author Justice Antonin Scalia reiterated that the Second Amendment and Heller preclude assault weapons bans when he signed onto a dissent from the denial of certiorari in Friedman v. Highland Park.10 More assault weapons and large magazines less crime From 1991 when violent crime hit an alltime high to 2017 the nation s total violent crime rate decreased 47 percent including a 34 percent decrease in the murder rate.11 Meanwhile Americans bought about 200 million new firearms12 including more than eighteen million AR15s13 and so many tens of millions of large handgun and rifle magazines that it seems pointless to attempt a count.14 Different guns same old tune In the 1970s gun control supporters predicted that crime would rise unless Congress banned all handguns.15 In the 1980s they said the same thing about compact smallcaliber handguns.16 For a quartercentury they ve said the same thing about assault weapons and large magazines17 and RighttoCarry laws under which people carry semiautomatic handguns and large magazines for selfdefense.18Every one of these predictions has been proven false.19 Nevertheless they have expanded their definition of assault weapon to include virtually all semiautomatic shotguns and detachablemagazine semiautomatic rifles comparable handguns and various fixedmagazine rifles and continue to press for a ban on magazines.20 Study for Congress and followup studies The congressionallymandated study of the federal assault weapon and large magazine ban concluded that the banned guns were never used in more than a modest fraction of all gun murders before the ban and the ban s 10round limit on new magazines wasn t a factor in multiplevictim or multiplewound crimes.21 A followup study concluded that AWs assault weapons and LCMs large capacity magazines were used in only a minority of gun crimes prior to the 1994 federal ban relatively few attacks involve more than 10 shots fired and the ban s effects on gun violence are likely to be small at best and perhaps too small for reliable measurement. 22 Another followup study found gunshot injury incidents involving pistols many of which use magazines that hold more than 10 rounds were less likely to produce a death than those involving revolvers which typically hold five or six rounds and the average number of wounds for pistol victims was actually lower than that for revolver victims. 23 In 2018 the RAND Corporation released a study that surveyed the available research on the effects of bans on assault weapons and large capacity magazines. The study found no conclusive evidence that such bans have an effect on mass shootings or violent crime.24 History of semiautomatic firearms Semiautomatic firearms were introduced in the 19th century. The first semiautomatic rifle was introduced in 1885 the first semiautomatic pistol in 1892 and the first semiautomatic shotgun in 1902.25 Semiautomatics account for 2025 percent of the approximately 400 million privatelyowned firearms in the United States today and the percentage is rising because semiautomatics account for over half of the 1015 million new firearms bought annually.26 Semiautomatics fire only one shot when the trigger is pulled like revolvers boltactions leveractions pumpactions doublebarrels and all other types of firearms except fullyautomatics machine guns.27 Thus semiautomatics cannot spray fire and they re not designed to be fired from the hip. 28 They aren t highpowered 29 there are no devices that convert them into machine guns legally30 they aren t equipped with grenade launchers and rocket launchers 31 and they certainly aren t weapons of mass destruction. 32 Origin of the issue The most popular semiautomatic firearm that gun control supporters call an assault weapon the AR15 was introduced in 1963 but gun control supporters didn t decide to call it and other semiautomatic firearms assault weapons until 1984.33 Gun control activists began campaigning against assault weapons only after they realized that their previous campaign to get handguns banned had failed.34 In 1988 an antihandgun activist group recommended to other such groups  Assault weapons . . . will . . . strengthen the handgun restriction lobby . . . . Handgun restriction consistently remains a nonissue with the vast majority of legislators the press and public. . . . Assault weapons . . . are a new topic. The weapons menacing looks coupled with the public s confusion over fully automatic machine guns versus semiautomatic assault weapons anything that looks like a machine gun is assumed to be a machine gun can only increase the chance of public support for restrictions on these weapons. . . . Efforts to restrict assault weapons are more likely to succeed than those to restrict handguns.35  ATF 1989 importation ban The antihandgun group also recommended that the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF adopt guidelines to prohibit the importation of assault weapons. 36 The following year ATF banned the importation of 43 models of semiautomatic rifles that it had previously approved for importation.37  Because federal law requires ATF to approve the importation of any firearm that is particularly suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes 38 the agency took the curious position that target shooting meant only organized marksmanship competition. Furthermore ATF ignored the portion of the law requiring approval of the importation of firearms that are readily adaptable to sporting purposes.  In 1998 ATF expanded its ban to include any semiautomatic rifle capable of using a detachable magazine that could hold more than 10 rounds.39 Gun control supporters periodically insist that the importation restrictions be tightened.40 California s and New Jersey s bans California banned assault weapons in 1989 and New Jersey banned assault firearms in 1990. New Jersey s ban included the Marlin Model 60 .22 caliber squirrel rifle which an antigun New Jersey politician called a peoplekilling machine. Both states allowed owners to register and keep banned guns already owned but only about 10 percent of owners complied with the registration requirements.41 Several other states subsequently banned assault weapons assault pistols andor large magazines.42 Clinton assault weapon ban President Bill Clinton campaigned for a federal assault weapon and large magazine ban proposed by Sen. Dianne Feinstein DCalif. saying people can t be so fixated on our desire to preserve the rights of ordinary Americans. 43 Crime reports and felon surveys showed that assault weapons were used in only 12 percent of violent crimes and in the 10 preceding years murders committed without guns outnumbered those with assault weapons by about 37to1.44 Nevertheless the ClintonFeinstein ban on new manufacture of assault weapons and magazines that hold more than 10 rounds was imposed from 1994 to 2004.  Pushing for an expanded ban As the scheduled 2004 expiration of the ban approached gun control supporters campaigned to have the ban not only extended but also expanded the Brady Campaign calling California s ban the model for the nation. 45 But because assault weapons are used in only a tiny percentage of murders California s murder rate increased every year for five years after its 1989 ban 26 percent overall while in the rest of the country murder increased 10 percent. During the first five years after California expanded its ban in 2000 the state s murder rate increased 10 percent compared to a five percent decrease in the rest of country.46 Nevertheless in 2013 Feinstein introduced a ban much more restrictive than the one in effect between 1994 and 2004.47 Whereas her 1994 ban merely prohibited manufacturing or assembling one of the targeted firearms with its full complement of standard external attachments her 2013 bill would have banned the manufacture of the same firearms altogether as well as banned the manufacture of other firearms not addressed in the 1994 legislation. Her 2013 bill would have banned the manufacture of any semiautomatic shotgun or detachablemagazine semiautomatic rifle that had any characteristic that can function as a grip as well as various fixed magazine rifles and selfdefense handguns and prohibit anyone from selling or otherwise transferring a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence and Million Mom March have proposed that pumpaction firearms be banned as assault weapons too.48 Semiautomatic rifles like the AR15 are the most popular rifles in the United States for home protection and defensive skillsbased firearm training and marksmanship competitions49 and they re increasingly popular among hunters.50 Ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds are standard equipment for many handguns and rifles designed for defensive purposes they re commonly used in handguns kept for protection at home and carried for protection away from home and they re commonly used in defensive skillsbased firearm training and sports.51  1 Roth Koper et al.

The Court said that the inherent right of selfdefense has been central to the Second Amendment right which is the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation including all instruments that constitute bearable arms. It struck down D.C. s handgun ban saying the handgun ban amounts to a prohibition of an entire class of arms that is overwhelmingly chosen by American society for the lawful purpose of selfdefense. Explaining its deference to the firearm preferences of the American people the Court cited its decision in U.S. v. Miller 1939 that the Second Amendment protects the right to arms that have a reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia and citing the decision of the Tennessee Supreme Court in Aymette v. State 1840 arms that are part of the ordinary military equipment andor that could be used to contribute to the common defense. The Miller Court said that citizens called into militia service were traditionally expected to appear bearing arms supplied by themselves and of the kind in common use at the time.  9 Gun control supporters have tried to add more types of firearms to their lists of guns they want banned as assault weapons. For example the federal assault weapon and large magazine ban of 19942004 authored by Sen. Dianne Feinstein DCalif. defined assault weapons to include detachablemagazine semiautomatic rifles having two or more external attachments named in the law and comparable shotguns and handguns. But in 2013 Feinstein proposed S. 150 which because of the bill s definition of pistol grip would have banned firearms regardless of their number of external attachments as well as certain fixedmagazine semiautomatic rifles. Other gun control supporters have proposed that pumpaction shotguns and pumpaction rifles be banned as assault weapons too.

https://www.tallahassee.com/story/opinion/2022/07/25/why-all-semi-automatic-weapons-must-banned-national-basis-opinion/10126597002/, There is no mention in the Second Amendment about an individual right to own and bear arms. The purpose of the Second Amendment was to placate those former colonies and soon to be States who feared the potential of a federal government acting like the King they just overthrew. The bulk of the military that fought the Revolutionary War was state militias the modern equivalent of which is the National Guard acting under the command of federal forces.  This is not dissimilar from the current structure of our military forces. Recent interpretations of the Second Amendment by the Supreme Court are simply mental gymnastics designed to achieve a political end desired by a very vocal but small minority.  The single common factor in all the recent mass shootings was the use of semiautomatic weapons fully automatic weapons have been banned for many years. All semiautomatic weapons both rifles and handguns must be banned on a national basis. It is selfevident that these weapons are not needed for either personal protection or for hunting. Restrictions on the private ownership of weapons are not prohibited by the Constitution. With the elimination of semiautomatic weapons there should also be a ban on highcapacity magazines. These prohibitions should be coupled with a national buyback program of semiautomatic weapons but the refusal to sell these weapons or magazines to the government would not itself be a crime. Rather if a crime is committed using a prohibited weapon or magazine the owner or immediate seller of such a weapon or magazine would be equally liable for any crime committed with such weapon or magazine regardless of who pulled the trigger. Simple if you keep these weapons keep them safe and locked up. This criminal liability should be expanded to include any crime committed by a weapon whose owner failed to safely store and lock their guns. Think of all the guns that are stolen from unlocked cars! Ownership of a weapon designed to maim and kill another person should require the same level of responsibility as ownership of other property that can cause serious injury or death like an automobile. There will be those who strongly disagree with this approach. Those individuals should ask themselves what price is too high to pay for human life? Does a human life not mean anything? Is it really alright to hold onto extreme ideas of personal freedom when the result of such ideas leads directly to the mass destruction of human life? What kind of society do we want to live in? The Constitution expressly allows Congress the right and authority to dictate the jurisdiction of the federal courts. To make sure the will of a majority of U.S. citizens are implemented Congress could remove from the jurisdiction of the federal courts the ability to rule on the constitutionality of a ban of semiautomatic weapons similar to the removal of jurisdiction over habeas corpus during the Civil War.  The only way to avoid minority rule is for the majority to support and vote for those representatives at all levels of government local state and federal who also share the same view of society. The foundation of our society rests on all aspects of our lives including our right to live a peaceful life while being responsible for our actions. Based on polling data we believe we know what that majority wants. Now is the time to make clear what kind of society we really want. It is time to speak up now by voting in November our future depends on it. Putting the Genie back is the bottle will be a long process but we must start sometime.

https://debateus.org/gun-control-should-assault-weapons-be-banned/, Daily Mail November 24 2022 httpswww.dailymail.co.uknewsarticle11466323BidenmakesThanksgivingattacksicksalesemiautomaticweapons.html President Joe Biden called the sale of semiautomatic weapons sick and continued to call for an assault weapons ban and better red flag laws in the wake of mass shootings at a Chesapeake Virginia Walmart and a Colorado Springs LGBTQ club.  The idea that we still allow semiautomatic weapons to be purchased is sick Biden told reporters on Thursday during a quick stop at the Nantucket Fire Department to bring first responders some Thanksgiving pumpkin pie. It s just sick. It has no no social redeeming value. Zero. None. Not a single solitary rationale for it except profit for the gun manufacturers.  The gunman 22yearold Anderson Lee Aldrich brought an ARstyle weapon and a handgun to Club Q on Saturday night and had been previously charged with felony menacing and firstdegree kidnapping after making a bomb threat. The Chesapeake Virginia shooter used a pistol which wouldn t fall under any such ban. The US had a ban on assault weapons. What did it expire? 2019 Yes. Twenty five years ago when Biden was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee Congress passed the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act commonly called the assault weapons ban. It prohibited the manufacture or sale for civilian use of certain semiautomatic weapons that could be converted to fire automatically. The act also banned magazines that could accommodate 10 rounds or more.  Assault weapons militarystyle firearms designed to fire rapidly are a threat to our national security and we should treat them as such Biden wrote in his weekend oped. Anyone who pretends there s nothing we can do is lying and holding that view should be disqualifying for anyone seeking to lead our country.  The earlier ban was enacted as a subsection of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 an electionyear package meant to show that Democrats were tough on crime. Times were different then. More Americans said they worried about violent crime and the threat associated with criminals armed with powerful weapons. So among other things Biden and Democrats got behind stricter sentencing guidelines and expanding the category of federal crimes punishable with the death penalty. At the time Biden defended the legislation against charges of weakness by saying We do everything but hang people for jaywalking in this bill.  WalMart CEO.

I spent my entire professional life taking up arms in defense of our country serving in wars from Vietnam to Afghanistan and ending my service as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. During the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan I saw how our ground forces and special forces sought to improve the precision and lethality of their weapons which took enemy lives and saved their own. Such is the nature of war But these weapons are for war they are not for sport. Assault weapons are designed to kill as many people as possible in the shortest time possible. As the tragic events last week in El Paso and Dayton attest these weapons make it virtually impossible for lawenforcement agencies to stop those bent on taking lives.

For more than 20 years Congress has included a provision in funding bills that prohibits the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using money to do anything that could be considered advocating for or promoting gun control.But some studies were funded by the National Institute of Justice to try to figure out what the impact of the assault weapons ban was. A key investigator conducting those studies was Dr. Christopher Koper the principal fellow of George Mason s Center for EvidenceBased Crime Policy. In the 2013 book Reducing Gun Violence in America Koper wrote In summary the ban had mixed effects in reducing crimes with the banned weaponry because of various exemptions and loopholes in the legislation. The ban did not appear to affect gun crime during the time it was in effect but some evidence suggests it may have modestly reduced gunshot victimization had it remained in place for a longer period. And in 2017 he and other researchers had a slightly more positive view of the ban s impact while it was in place. The study cautions that much more research is needed but that..AlternativesDon t ban assault weapons. Tax them. Arguments over the Second Amendment s meaning too often ignore a simple fact The goal of the right to keep and bear arms is to safeguard the security of a free state. Today s gun policies are making most Americans less not more secure. Instead of simply extolling the virtues of the Second Amendment we should take some of our cues from the policies the founding generation used including taxation. We need to understand how the Second Amendment fit into a society that valued peace as a vital precondition for the exercise of liberty. At the very minimum considering taxation as a tool of gun policy should spur us to think more creatively about how to solve our contemporary society s problem with firearms.

Our father Eugene Stoner designed the AR15 and subsequent M16 as a military weapon to give our soldiers an advantage over the AK47 Stoner s children said in an interview with NBC News. He died long before any mass shootings occurred. But we do think he would have been horrified and sickened as anyone if not more by these events. Their sentiment is mirrored by millions of Americans who have become increasingly more accustomed to turning on their news only to see horrifying footage of yet another mass shooting. According to a 2019 Gallup article approximately 60 percent of Americans are in favor of an assault rifle ban similar to the one that existed in the United States U.S. from 1994 to 2004. However when weighing this issue there are more points to consider than simply popular support. After reading this article the effectiveness and need for an assault rifle ban will become evident and the legitimacy of an array of common oppositions to this statement will be cast into severe doubt. Many informed citizens on this topic may have picked up on the fact that in the initial example a quote from the inventor of the AR15 is cited a gun that is not officially recognized as an assault rifle. This is due to the fact that this article critiques a piece of legislation that not only bans legitimate assault rifles but also prohibits the sale of all semiautomatic shotguns and rifles that are capable of holding more than 10 rounds as cited from WUSF News. This distinction is important to keep in mind as when considering this case we must look at shootings involving guns like the AR15 not just official assault rifles such as the M16. Semiautomatic weapons are much more commonly used in mass shootings and must be immediately banned. When considering the assault rifle ban detractors will often cite that the majority of the U.S. nearly 40000 annual gun deaths involve handguns and not assault rifles thus showing that assault rifles are not important enough to be banned. The facts however show that the real issues lie in the ability of assault rifles to cause mass indiscriminate death. Of the 28 deadliest mass shootings in recent U.S. history all but two used some form of semiautomatic weapon that would under a formal assault rifle ban such as the one passed in 1994 be banned. A true eyeopener to the devastating nature of these guns was the 2017 Las Vegas shooting which left 58 dead and 422 injured. The use of bump stock equipped semiautomatic rifles in conjunction with sniper rifles in this deadly killing truly shows the ability for any deranged man woman or teenager to acquire a weapon and use it to slaughter people who they had no qualms with. As American vetran Michael Diamond wrote Assault rifles are uniquely lethal because they re designed to kill as many humans as possible as quickly as possible.  Once one acknowledges that this assault rifle ban would take unnecessarily dangerous weapons off the streets they are met with the dilemma of whether or not any positive change would be brought to the status quo. Luckily for Americans there is a clear example for us to base our research off of. The 1994 Assault Weapons Ban had mixed results partially due to the fact that the plan contained numerous grandfathering provisions that would have taken longer to integrate. One conclusion however has been conclusively drawn So using that as a very tentative guide that s high enough to suggest that eliminating or greatly reducing crimes with these magazines could produce a small reduction in shootings likely something less than 5 percent. Now we should note that effects of this magnitude could be hard to ever measure in any very definitive way but they nonetheless could have nontrivial notable benefits for society Christopher Koper said in his immersive report on the topic. Consider for example at our current level of our gun violence achieving a 1 percent reduction in fatal and nonfatal criminal shootings would prevent approximately 650 shootings annually And of course having these sorts of guns and particularly magazines less accessible to offenders could make it more difficult for them to commit the sorts of mass shootings that we ve seen in recent years. This statement is mirrored by the fact that of the 25 mass shootings with over 10 victims that occurred in the 39 year time frame between 1982 and 2020 a grand total of only two occurred between 1994 and 2004. Only one of these two mass shootings used a semiautomatic weapon with the other being committed with a normal pistol. When debating this topic gun advocates will often bring up points such as mass shootings kill only a fraction of people as compared to car accidents assault weapons make up a small portion of gun deaths criminals will still get guns illegally and restricting the access to guns is unconstitutional. Amongst the first two contentions I would ask why this is relevant. Assault weapon homicides are clearly an issue and unlike most systemic problems there is a clear path to minimizing this. Acknowledging this issue and yet not acting would be equivalent to if the government noticed that 300 kids were dying every year due to a lack of seat belts but decided that it was not a large enough issue to tackle. When considering human life all precautions should be taken to prevent death while maintaining freedoms.  When considering the third contention it is important to keep the statistics in mind. Of the 98 recent mass shootings where whether the gun was purchased legally or illegally is confirmed only about 16 percent of the cases involved the latter. While one should not assume that this means that we will see an 84 percent decline in mass shootings if we put in place the proposed ban it is logical to presume that these tragic events would occur at much lower rates than the status quo. Through the presented information it should be clear that assault weapons are unnecessarily dangerous and that normal people should not be able to acquire them the same way civilians are not permitted to assemble their own nuclear weapons. When America s Founding Fathers signed the U.S. Constitution they did not intend for the Second Amendment to allow mentally troubled teenagers to murder their classmates in cold blood rapists to shoot up churches or racists to open fire on vulnerable minorities. There is no reason to protect the unnecessarily violent assault weapons that lead to excessive death and suffering and America should take steps to get these guns off our streets. Hey my name is Dhruv Gupta and I m a 17 year old from California. I enjoy writing satire for YIP and also serve as the organization s Director of Technology. I also love to stay educated on the new and contentious topics. The discourse surrounding the welfare state in the US and the Western world writ large has undoubtedly shifted rightward since the 1980s. There are many reasons for this but the biggest one is the myth of welfare dependency. My goal here is to critically examine the concept of welfare dependency itself and challenge its characterization as a real issue. The purpose is not to deny that welfare fraud exists or that stealing is good but rather that government intervention to protect people and grow the economy is justified even if it costs more and that rightwing arguments on the topic are fundamentally flawed. One of Asia s most important diplomatic wars is being waged somewhere else entirely the South Pacific. Taiwan is on the defensive as China gradually wins over its allies with economic aid while the United States concerns itself with the struggle s implications for its own position in the region.
