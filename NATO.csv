https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_NATO_Hymn, The NATO Hymn French Hymne de lOTAN is the organizational anthem of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO. It is an instrumental piece composed in 1989 by Andr Reichling a Luxembourgish military officer and a member of its military band. It was used unofficially for many years before being formally adopted in January 2018. Initial proposals for adopting an organizational anthem for NATO date back to 1958 its tenth anniversary. A NATO Song was publicly performed but not adopted and a NATO ceremonial march was written to be performed during visits of dignitaries to NATO headquarters. In 1960 British Royal Air Force marshal Edward Chilton proposed combining members states national anthems into a single composition as the organizational anthem. 1  In 1989 to commemorate NATOs 40th anniversary Luxembourgish military band officer Andr Reichling composed an instrumental musical piece titled The NATO Hymn and it was performed at an anniversary gala that year. 2 Used as an unofficial anthem at many NATO events in subsequent years it was formally adopted on 3 January 2018. 3 ,
https://www.foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/europe-not-nato-should-send-troops-ukraine, These explosive comments are driven by shifting conflict dynamics. The debate in the U.S. Congress over sending military aid to Ukraine has been a debacle. A new aid package is finally on track for approval but the months of dithering in Washington have dismayed Europeans and given Moscow hope that Western resolve to support Kyiv is cracking. Russian forces bolstered by equipment from China Iran and North Korea have taken advantage of the gap in U.S. military support for Ukraine by stepping up their attacks on civilians and nonmilitary infrastructure. In early April knowing that Ukraine was running short of antiaircraft ammunition Russia launched a missile attack that destroyed the largest power plant in the Kyiv region. Earlier in March Russian forces targeted a hydroelectric dam in Dnipro and other electrical facilities around Kherson undermining Ukrainian industry and making the country s economy more dependent on the European electrical grid. Further damage to critical infrastructure nuclear power plants and agricultural land will dramatically raise the costs of reconstruction for which Ukraine s partners in the West will likely have to foot much of the bill. As Russian forces speed up their advance the possibility that they could break through Ukrainian defenses along the eastern front and challenge Ukrainian control of Kharkiv or even Kyiv presents Europe with a security threat it cannot ignore. A Russian victory in Ukraine would vindicate President Vladimir Putin s revisionist ambitions and belief in the inherent weakness of the West. It would enable the Kremlin to keep Russia on a war footing an allofsociety approach to conquest that European countries would be unable to match. There is no reason to expect Putin to stop with Ukraine he has already declared that all former Soviet republics should be returned to Russia. The Baltic states could be next and Finland and Poland which were both principalities in the preSoviet Russian Empire could follow. By threatening to send troops European countries are trying to disrupt this worrying trajectory. To truly change the outcome in Ukraine however European countries must do more than simply talk about deployments. If the United States continues to delay aid and especially if it elects Donald Trump who has pledged to end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours presumably by allowing Putin to keep his illgotten gains as president in November Europe will be Ukraine s only defender. European leaders cannot afford to let American political dysfunction dictate European security. They must seriously contemplate deploying troops to Ukraine to provide logistical support and training to protect Ukraine s borders and critical infrastructure or even to defend Ukrainian cities. They must make it clear to Russia that Europe is willing to protect Ukraine s territorial sovereignty. Accepting the dire reality of the situation in Ukraine and addressing it now is better than leaving a door open for Russia to accelerate its imperial advance. The idea of European troops deploying to Ukraine has elicited predictable objections. The Kremlin was outraged by Macron and others recent statements warning of war possibly a nuclear one with all of Europe. Washington and Berlin also responded angrily. Both Germany and the United States have strictly limited the aid they gave Ukraine throughout the war agonizing that Russia might make good on its threats of escalation and they sharply criticized the more hawkish European states for what they see as unnecessary provocation. Such opposition does not lessen the benefits that European forces would provide in Ukraine and the fact that Berlin Moscow and Washington all reacted so strongly shows why it is so important to have this discussion. European leaders have demonstrated that it is possible to break out of a onesided escalation debate that until how has worked to Russia s advantage. In the previous pattern Moscow has threatened escalation and Berlin and Washington have responded with words and actions aimed at deescalation a dynamic that deters both Germany and the United States from sending the more advanced missile systems that Ukraine desperately needs. Now Europe is making the threats and Russia is looking deeply uncomfortable. Too many politicians and pundits in the United States and Europe echo Putin s own talking points by warning that any kind of external intervention in Ukraine would lead to World War III. In reality sending European troops would be a normal response to a conflict of this kind. Russia s invasion disrupted the regional balance of power and Europe has a vital interest in seeing the imbalance corrected. The obvious way to do this is to provide a lifeline to a Ukrainian military that could once again be left high and dry by the United States and the best lifeline would be European soldiers. Unless the politics in the United States change Ukraine will need alternate sources of assistance to keep its fight going and Europe is the natural backer. European forces could undertake either noncombat or combat operations to relieve some of the pressure on Ukraine. A strictly noncombat mission would be easiest to sell in most European capitals. European forces could relieve the Ukrainians performing logistics functions such as maintaining and repairing combat vehicles. By staying west of the Dnieper River a natural barrier protecting much of Ukraine from Russian advances European forces would demonstrate that they are not there to kill Russian soldiers preempting the inevitable Russian accusation of European aggression. Some Ukrainian vehicles are already being sent to Germany Poland and Romania for substantial repairs but conducting this task closer to the front would speed up the process reduce the time equipment is out of combat and free up more Ukrainian forces for combat duties. French Polish and other European military advisers could also provide lethal and nonlethal training within Ukraine to further professionalize the country s military. If additional mobilization expands the Ukrainian military in the coming year which seems likely increased capacity to train new recruits inside Ukraine will be particularly useful. Of course European forces could do more than repair and train. The most limited form of European combat missions could still remain west of the Dnieper River and be defensive in nature. One such mission could involve strengthening Ukraine s air defense capabilities in this region by deploying personnel providing equipment or even taking over command and control of the Ukrainian air defense system. The risks of escalation would be minimal as European forces would have little chance of killing the Russian military pilots who launch munitions into Ukraine from Belarusian and Russian airspace. But they would help shoot down cruise missiles and drones. In doing so Europeanled air defense batteries would free up more Ukrainian troops to protect forces near the frontlines while also frustrating Russian attempts to destroy critical infrastructure and terrify the Ukrainian population into surrender. European forces could perform other defensive and humanitarian tasks too such as demining and defusing unexploded Russian ordinance. Taking over such work from Ukrainian personnel would help protect civilians and support Ukraine s economic recovery as farmers are now struggling to plant and harvest crops in fields full of mines and other unexploded munitions. Another combat role which like an air defense mission would likely not engage Russian forces would involve patrolling parts of the Ukrainian border where Russian troops are not deployed such as the Black Sea coast and the borders with Belarus and Transnistria a breakaway region in Moldova occupied by Russian forces. Guarding these flanks would free up more than 20000 Ukrainian troops and the weapons and ammunition they carry to fight on the frontlines. It would also reduce the likelihood of a new front opening along these borders as Russia would almost certainly seek to avoid broadening the war by attacking other European militaries. European forces could also help secure Ukraine s three remaining Black Sea ports which are vital to both the Ukrainian economy and global food security relieving additional Ukrainian soldiers. Any kind of European operation in Ukraine would carry emotional weight as well. The presence of European troops would raise the morale of the Ukrainian people and reassure them that their country s future is in Europe. Finally Europe needs to consider a direct combat mission that helps protect Ukrainian territory west of the Dnieper. In addition to reducing the burden of the Ukrainian military in these regions the presence of European troops would make it unlikely that Russian forces would advance across the river protecting much of Ukraine from conquest. One potential Russian target is Odessa Ukraine s main port where most of the country s exports are shipped. If Russian troops were to approach the city European forces in the vicinity would have the right to defend themselves by firing on the advancing soldiers. They could help thwart a Russian offensive that given Odessa s strategic position could strangle the Ukrainian economy and position Russian forces for a potential invasion of Moldova. Moscow would try to spin any lethal response to a Russian attack as European aggression but Russia would be responsible for any escalation. The risk that deploying European soldiers to Ukraine in any capacity will escalate the conflict is overblown. Russia has precious little room to scale up its conventional attacks short of deploying biological or chemical weapons. It has already lost more than 90 percent of its prewar army with hundreds of thousands of casualties tens of thousands of combat vehicles destroyed and the vast majority of its most advanced weapons systems expended in attacks on Ukraine. Sanctions have made Russian weapons production more difficult and costly and the deployment of troops to Ukraine has left Russia with barely enough forces to guard the rest of its long border let alone mount a significant operation against other European states. In January 2022 the Russian army was widely considered second only to the U.S. Army today it may not even be the most powerful army in Ukraine. But if European leaders were to let Russia win in Ukraine Putin s takeaway would be that making nuclear threats could allow him to conquer more countries without provoking a European military response. The real question is whether Russia would actually use nuclear weapons if European forces enter Ukraine. Arguably this is already a moot point given that special operations forces from Western countries are currently operating inside Ukraine. Moscow regularly employs aggressive rhetoric toward NATO members but so far it has been all bark and no bite avoiding contact with NATO forces and focusing instead on neighboring countries outside the alliance such as Georgia and Ukraine that it can safely kick around. Putin threatened to attack Poland Romania and the Baltic states back in 2014 and over the next several years he threatened to invade Finland and Sweden for joining NATO Norway for hosting additional U.S. troops Poland and Romania for housing ballistic missile defense facilities and any European countries that allowed U.S. missiles to be deployed on their soil. In the past decade and a half the Kremlin has threatened or run war games that simulate the use of nuclear weapons against Denmark Poland Sweden Ukraine the United Kingdom the Baltic states the European Union as a whole and of course NATO and the United States. At some point European leaders must ignore Putin s saberrattling which is merely propaganda premised on the baseless notion that NATO wants to attack or invade Russia. Ultimately Russia cannot afford to fight multiple European countries at once much less start a nuclear war. Tellingly the countries that are most likely to be targeted in a nuclear attack those that border Russia particularly Poland and the Baltic states are the least concerned about that prospect but rightly fear the aggression of a reconstituted conventional Russian military buoyed by success in Ukraine. Europe is far richer is more technologically advanced and has a much larger population than Russia. Moscow knows it cannot win by provoking the whole continent and it seeks to avoid the U.S. military intervention that would very likely follow if Russian forces were to invade a NATO country and trigger Article 5 of the alliance s charter. Instead Russia is basing its hopes for victory almost entirely on Europe treating Ukraine as separate from the rest of the continent. So far its hopes have come to pass. European leaders have tolerated attacks on Ukraine that would have triggered a united European response had they happened in any NATO or EU member state. This attitude has allowed Russia to escalate its war in Ukraine safe in the knowledge that the rest of Europe will keep its distance. The arrival of European forces in Ukraine would change that calculation. Moscow would have to face the possibility that European escalation could make the war unwinnable for Russia. Moreover a Europeanled response would subvert Russian propaganda that NATO countries intervention in Ukraine is merely an American ploy to undermine Russia. The narrative that NATO is the aggressor in this war is popular in many parts of the world and countering it could help Europe further isolate Moscow both diplomatically and economically. And because European forces would be acting outside the NATO framework and NATO territory any casualties would not trigger an Article 5 response and draw in the United States. Russia s opponent would not be NATO but a coalition of European countries seeking to balance against naked Russian imperialism. Ukraine is doing the best it can but it needs help help that European countries are able and increasingly willing to provide. Rather than force Russian escalation a European troop presence would be more likely to prevent the conflict from spreading and prevent further damage to Ukraine s economy and infrastructure. European leaders do not need to follow the dictates of an increasingly unreliable United States about how the battle in Ukraine should be waged they can and should decide for themselves how best to ensure the continent s freedom and security. Europe must do what it takes to safeguard its own future and that starts with making sure Ukraine wins this war.

https://mwi.westpoint.edu/sweden-finland-and-natos-first-class-airpower-upgrade/, Paul Cormarie and John Hoehn 04.19.24 In 2016 RAND ran a series of wargames examining a contingency in the Baltics. NATO did not do well. Russia often gained control of the Baltic states before NATO could respond creating a fait accompli and dealing a severe blow to the alliance. At the time US forces in Europe had atrophied. Both ground and air forces had been drawn down to respond to threats elsewhere. US forces were still largely postured in Germany a relic of the Cold War. This posed vulnerabilities to NATO s new borders in both the northeast and the southeast. While under the NATO deterrence umbrella the Baltic states in particular were viewed as defenseless to Russian aggression. Though NATO began to improve its posture with a tripwire force it remained far from completely deterring Russian forces. Russia s 2022 invasion of Ukraine fundamentally changed Europe s security environment. Finland and Sweden both longtime neutral states decided to join NATO. This in turn drastically changed Europe s airpower from its mid2010s levels. What do these new alliance members bring to the air fight and how does this impact the wargame scenario in the Baltics? The accession of Finland and Sweden to NATO brings significant additional airpower contributions. In the case of Finland those contributions are a function of its fleet of aircraft. Finland has ordered sixtyfour F35s the largest order in Europe after the United Kingdom. These orders represent the equivalent of multiple squadrons either fighter or electronic attack capabilities that offer a significant contribution for penetrating and rolling back Russian air defenses. In Sweden s case NATO also gains valuable airpower in the form of its operational aircraft. Swedish forces operate around seventyfive JAS 39 Gripens. The Gripen has modern electric warfare capabilities and high readiness that can perform expeditionary operations limiting Russia s ability to target aircraft on the ground. Moreover Sweden has an active defense aerospace industrial base. Few other NATO nations have active production lines capable of producing modern fighter aircraft. And in both cases geography matters. Both Finland s and Sweden s proximity allows NATO air forces to stage closer to the Baltics. This reduces logistical constraints and better enables the alliance to sustain air operations while also increasing aircraft persistence. To better defend the Baltics after the wargames RAND proposed a series of initiatives. NATO air forces would serve as the hammer to counter Russian advances while ground forces would be the anvil to regain territory. The issue was amassing sufficient aircraft and armor in time for NATO to respond. These new allies however help to address that issue in two ways. First Finland and Sweden increase NATO s highend airpower capacity. This means that the United States would not have to flow its own airpower capabilities many of which are based back in the United States into theater as quickly and enables it to deter aggression elsewhere in the world. Finland s F35s allow it reach into Russiandefended airspace from the outset of hostilities while Sweden s Gripen fleet can quickly support ground forces by performing strike missions. Second Finish and Swedish bases are closer to the Baltics than most other NATO bases from which aircraft would operate in the event of a conflict offering shorter transit times and more time to support ground forces. For instance Finland s accession imposes a dilemma on Russian military planners forcing them to consider balancing offensive plans in say Estonia while considering defensive operations to protect their own borders. Sweden on the other hand offers expeditionary basing options on Gotland Island though it was assumed as available to NATO forces during the wargame its certain participation in the fight today allows military planners a greater set of choices. Together both nations also provide valuable transit routes for NATO aircraft to reinforce the battlespace while avoiding Kaliningrad s air defenses. Forward basing also reduces the reliance on NATO tankers which proved a limiting factor in wargames while increasing onstation time thus allowing additional time to counterattack adversary forces. Should a protracted conflict emerge Sweden s industrial capacity would be critical for NATO to recapitalize attrition. Of course this industrial infrastructure is potentially vulnerable to Russian attack in the event of a conflict. But from a Russian perspective that poses an enhanced dilemma as commanders must select from a wider range of targets in any initial salvo. Sweden s industrial capacity also becomes an important bedrock for aircraft regeneration which Russia would need to attack to sustain its Baltic offensive. Saab s increasing footprint in US and European markets allows it to seamlessly integrate with NATO forces. New basing increased capacity and improved industrial resiliency all improve NATO and US military s planners options in response to a Russian contingency. More flexibility to the West s response is a gamechanger not just in the Baltics but overall planning in airpower. Less ambiguity in the Baltic region allows US air forces to commit some capability to deter adversaries from aggression in other theaters like an opportunistic invasion of Taiwan. These new members also bring NATO closer to the fight and make it better able to support ground forces. And integrating industrial capacity into the alliance like Saab s entry into the NATO market also allows more options and competition in Europe s defense industrial base generating new opportunities for collaboration. Thanks to its renewed airpower NATO s hammer can further deter Russia from going on the offensive. This combined with more flexible NATO defenses leaves Moscow with few good options in the Baltics. Editor s note This article originally stated that Finland had ordered FA18EF Super Hornets and EA18G Growlers in addition to the sixtyfour F35s it ordered. In fact the F35s were selected instead of the Super Hornets and Growlers. The text has been updated to reflect this. Paul Cormarie is a policy analyst at the nonprofit nonpartisan RAND Corporation and a former researcher with the NATO Parliamentary Assembly. John Hoehn is an associate policy researcher at the nonprofit nonpartisan RAND Corporation and former military analyst with the Congressional Research Service. The views expressed are those of the authors and do not reflect the official position of the United States Military Academy Department of the Army or Department of Defense. You might want to fix or retract this article because Finland has no Superhornets and has no intention of buying any and the same goes for the Growlers. US approved a potential sale of those planes to Finland but they came second in the HX competition while F35 won. Thus Finland will be receiving 64 f35s in this decade and no other combat aircraft. Finland most certainly did NOT order Superhornets and Growlers. It was an option the bidding was won by the F35. PLEASE pay attention to actualities when writing articles with interesting headings. The Super HornetGrowler combo was offered in the HX competition to replace Finland s CD Hornet fleet but in the end the F35 was chosen. So Finland will not operate both systems only the F35. But Finland and Sweden will still be a great addition to NATO air power. Fact check your article. This is untrue Finland ordered fiftyeight FA18EF Super Hornets and an additional fourteen EA18G Growlers We did though order sixtyfour F35s Please check the parameters on the war game and while you at it on your gen AI research tools. There is no Super hornets coming to Finland only 64 F35. Your email address will not be published.

These rickety uninsured vessels running oil from Russia to China India and others live offbook as they cruise the world s oceans to dodge sanctions. But they re all too real as Russia s maritime neighbors have painfully discovered. I ve written about the risk of disastrous oil spills as these shadow vessels pass through Denmark s treacherous Great Belt. In recent weeks they have begun conducting a lot of their business just outside the Swedish Baltic Sea island of Gotland. That offers the unorthodox possibility of two unlikely allies joining forces NATO and environmental groups such as Greenpeace. Neither wants to see oil spilt from crumbling hulks into Europe s waters. The shadow vessels travel through the waters of countries that have no oil dealings with Russia but foot the bill each time one of these vessels has an accident in their waters. Last month the shadow oil tanker Andromeda Star which is as is normal for shadow vessels managed by an obscure firm and was sold to undisclosed buyers at the end of 2023 hit a cargo vessel just off the coast of Denmark. Ordinarily the tanker s insurance would have covered the incident. But because the Andromeda Star is a shadow vessel it lacked the Western insurance that is the industry standard. Instead it is insured by a mysterious Russian outfit that s unlikely to pay out a single krone. Denmark s taxpayers may never recover the money the authorities spent attending to the incident. Fortunately the Andromeda Star had its accident while traveling to Russia its tanks empty or the consequences could have been far worse. As I ve written for Foreign Policy when Russian shadow vessels sail from Baltic Sea ports out to the Atlantic they typically pass through the Great Belt. And because many of them refuse pilotage the risk of accidents is enormous. Yet under international maritime rules Denmark can t bar these risky vessels from entering. On April 3 a sanctioned shadow tanker that appears to lack insurance and had been deflagged by Liberia sailed Lloyd s List Intelligence reports from the Russian fuel terminal UstLuga on the Baltic Sea through the strait between Denmark and Sweden on to the North Sea and the Mediterranean. Now Swedish authorities are concerned too. In recent weeks Russian shadow vessels have taken to positioning themselves just off the island of Gotland. Or rather they place themselves just outside the 12nauticalmile line that marks a country s territorial waters. But even outside territorial waters coastal states have an exclusive economic zone where they own the natural resources and it s those resources that are now in danger. The Russian ships are there to conduct shiptoship STS transfers the highly hazardous business of transferring oil from one vessel to another. The Swedish public broadcaster SVT has tracked vessels sailing from the Russian port of Primorsk and the UstLuga fuel terminal to the waters off eastern Gotland where they meet up with another tanker the Zircone. Swedish officials told me that Gabon the shadow fleet s flag state of choice is suddenly all over Swedish waters. We have a frontrow seat watching the shadow fleet in operation a senior Swedish official said. Like Denmark Sweden faces being subjected to oil spills that will harm its maritime environment and cause considerable work for the authorities and expense to the taxpayer. For many years STS has been a huge problem in Denmark too said retired Rear Adm. Nils Wang a former chief of the Royal Danish Navy. The risk of oil spills is considerable. But we found out that there was nothing we could do about the STS.  Oil spills caused by a hostile country illegally operating merchant vessels are not a military attack. But the vessels are indisputably harmful not just to Sweden and Denmark but also to Finland Estonia Norway and other NATO member states whose waters they traverse. Indeed as I argued in January Russia could instruct shadow vessels to deliberately cause harm a cheap and easy way of hurting NATO member states. It doesn t help that the Zircone belongs to the Latvian company Fastbunkering which is itself owned by an Estonian firm. Environmental crimes are clearly not NATO s remit but local authorities can only investigate once an accident happens. And they won t be able to deter the activity. When researching this article I thought of something a Japanese journalist asked me Couldn t Greenpeace do something?  Of course it could! And before I had finished entertaining this thought the environmental campaign organization did. On April 12 Greenpeace activists turned up in small boats at the Zircone s waiting spot off Gotland and painted Oil Is War and People Want Peace on the tanker s hull. Suddenly the whole region knew that Russian shadow vessels had turned the waters off Gotland into a hub for hazardous oil activities.  This the shadow fleet is as wrong as it gets. Not only does the shadow fleet constitute an immediate environmental threat it is also fuelling Russia s war on Ukraine Rolf Lindahl Greenpeace Nordic s peace and energy campaigner said in a press release. Our mission at the moment is to bring attention to this problem and put pressure on our governments to stop the shadow vessels Lindahl told me by phone. Ever since the fullscale invasion of Ukraine we ve been bringing attention to Russia s transport of fossil fuels. It s a big problem for our region especially since so much of Russia s shadow fleet sails through the Baltic Sea.  Greenpeace has a long history of activism at sea directed against nuclear weapons whaling and much more as well as its own small boats. That has put it in the firing line in the past as when the French security service blew up a Greenpeace boat in New Zealand killing one person. Ideologically Greenpeace is often at odds with NATO and its members but when it comes to the shadow fleet they are so to speak in the same boat. Yes NATO and Greenpeace would be highly unlikely to officially join forces but both want the dirty boats gone.  It would be extremely difficult for NATO to team up with Greenpeace since Greenpeace s position is that they don t work with authorities Wang noted. It would have to be an unspoken alliance with the authorities not intervening whenever Greenpeace decided to spraypaint shadow vessels. As authorities what we can do is put the binoculars to our blind eye when they target shadow vessels. Military vessels for their part could patrol the waters frequented by shadow vessels. Both actions would cast unwanted attention on those who want to harm the planet in obscurity. Greenpeace and other activist outfits could also help by identifying and outing the shadowy entities that own the shadow vessels. Such shaming would convince many a shadowy owner that the shadow fleet isn t worth the effort. And analysts at NATO Greenpeace and beyond could send the International Maritime Organization IMO details about suspected shadow vessels. Armed with such data the IMO could create a list of vessels that bear the shadow fleet s trademarks of poor insurance obscure ownership regular signals gaps and frequently changing flag registration. Shadow vessel destinations like India may not have a clear picture of which vessels that arrive in their ports are shadow vessels Wang said. And India is surely not interested in having ships in its waters that could endanger the maritime environment.  New national security threats will in fact require NATO to become more agile. It can t respond to every threat of course it s a military alliance after all. But with galling violations that cause concrete harm to member states NATO can intervene together with novel allies. When it comes to the shadow fleet doing so would be a good deed for international security and for the environment.

https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/nato,   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization was created in 1949 by the United States Canada and several Western European nations to provide collective security against the Soviet Union. NATO was the first peacetime military alliance the United States entered into outside of the Western Hemisphere. After the destruction of the Second World War the nations of Europe struggled to rebuild their economies and ensure their security. The former required a massive influx of aid to help the wartorn landscapes reestablish industries and produce food and the latter required assurances against a resurgent Germany or incursions from the Soviet Union. The United States viewed an economically strong rearmed and integrated Europe as vital to the prevention of communist expansion across the continent. As a result Secretary of State George Marshall proposed a program of largescale economic aid to Europe. The resulting European Recovery Program or Marshall Plan not only facilitated European economic integration but promoted the idea of shared interests and cooperation between the United States and Europe. Soviet refusal either to participate in the Marshall Plan or to allow its satellite states in Eastern Europe to accept the economic assistance helped to reinforce the growing division between east and west in Europe. In 1947 1948 a series of events caused the nations of Western Europe to become concerned about their physical and political security and the United States to become more closely involved with European affairs. The ongoing civil war in Greece along with tensions in Turkey led President Harry S. Truman to assert that the United States would provide economic and military aid to both countries as well as to any other nation struggling against an attempt at subjugation. A Sovietsponsored coup in Czechoslovakia resulted in a communist government coming to power on the borders of Germany. Attention also focused on elections in Italy as the communist party had made significant gains among Italian voters. Furthermore events in Germany also caused concern. The occupation and governance of Germany after the war had long been disputed and in mid1948 Soviet premier Joseph Stalin chose to test Western resolve by implementing a blockade against West Berlin which was then under joint U.S. British and French control but surrounded by Sovietcontrolled East Germany. This Berlin Crisis brought the United States and the Soviet Union to the brink of conflict although a massive airlift to resupply the city for the duration of the blockade helped to prevent an outright confrontation. These events caused U.S. officials to grow increasingly wary of the possibility that the countries of Western Europe might deal with their security concerns by negotiating with the Soviets. To counter this possible turn of events the Truman Administration considered the possibility of forming a EuropeanAmerican alliance that would commit the United States to bolstering the security of Western Europe. The Western European countries were willing to consider a collective security solution. In response to increasing tensions and security concerns representatives of several countries of Western Europe gathered together to create a military alliance. Great Britain France Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg signed the Brussels Treaty in March 1948. Their treaty provided collective defense if any one of these nations was attacked the others were bound to help defend it. At the same time the Truman Administration instituted a peacetime draft increased military spending and called upon the historically isolationist Republican Congress to consider a military alliance with Europe. In May of 1948 Republican Senator Arthur H. Vandenburg proposed a resolution suggesting that the President seek a security treaty with Western Europe that would adhere to the United Nations charter but exist outside of the Security Council where the Soviet Union held veto power. The Vandenburg Resolution passed and negotiations began for the North Atlantic Treaty. In spite of general agreement on the concept behind the treaty it took several months to work out the exact terms. The U.S. Congress had embraced the pursuit of the international alliance but it remained concerned about the wording of the treaty. The nations of Western Europe wanted assurances that the United States would intervene automatically in the event of an attack but under the U.S. Constitution the power to declare war rested with Congress. Negotiations worked toward finding language that would reassure the European states but not obligate the United States to act in a way that violated its own laws. Additionally European contributions to collective security would require largescale military assistance from the United States to help rebuild Western Europe s defense capabilities. While the European nations argued for individual grants and aid the United States wanted to make aid conditional on regional coordination. A third issue was the question of scope. The Brussels Treaty signatories preferred that membership in the alliance be restricted to the members of that treaty plus the United States. The U.S. negotiators felt there was more to be gained from enlarging the new treaty to include the countries of the North Atlantic including Canada Iceland Denmark Norway Ireland and Portugal. Together these countries held territory that formed a bridge between the opposite shores of the Atlantic Ocean which would facilitate military action if it became necessary. The result of these extensive negotiations was the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty in 1949. In this agreement the United States Canada Belgium Denmark France Iceland Italy Luxemburg the Netherlands Norway Portugal and the United Kingdom agreed to consider attack against one an attack against all along with consultations about threats and defense matters. This collective defense arrangement only formally applied to attacks against the signatories that occurred in Europe or North America it did not include conflicts in colonial territories. After the treaty was signed a number of the signatories made requests to the United States for military aid. Later in 1949 President Truman proposed a military assistance program and the Mutual Defense Assistance Program passed the U.S. Congress in October appropriating some 1.4 billion dollars for the purpose of building Western European defenses. Soon after the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the outbreak of the Korean War led the members to move quickly to integrate and coordinate their defense forces through a centralized headquarters. The North Korean attack on South Korea was widely viewed at the time to be an example of communist aggression directed by Moscow so the United States bolstered its troop commitments to Europe to provide assurances against Soviet aggression on the European continent. In 1952 the members agreed to admit Greece and Turkey to NATO and added the Federal Republic of Germany in 1955. West German entry led the Soviet Union to retaliate with its own regional alliance which took the form of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and included the Soviet satellite states of Eastern Europe as members. The collective defense arrangements in NATO served to place the whole of Western Europe under the American nuclear umbrella. In the 1950s one of the first military doctrines of NATO emerged in the form of massive retaliation or the idea that if any member was attacked the United States would respond with a largescale nuclear attack. The threat of this form of response was meant to serve as a deterrent against Soviet aggression on the continent. Although formed in response to the exigencies of the developing Cold War NATO has lasted beyond the end of that conflict with membership even expanding to include some former Soviet states. It remains the largest peacetime military alliance in the world.  historystate.gov ,

Omar MarquesGetty ImagesOpinionApril 22 2024502 am CETBy Andrew A. MichtaAndrew A. Michta is senior fellow and director of the Scowcroft Strategy Initiative at the Atlantic Council of the United States. Views expressed here are his own. With the war in Ukraine advancing into its third year much ink has been spilled on how the collective West has finally awakened from its strategic slumber facing up to the threat Russia poses to Europe. But it s time we face the facts With the aid package to Ukraine finally passed by the U.S. Congress Europe has been slow to ramp up weapons and munitions production not only at the level needed to support Kyiv but also in terms of replenishing the stocks NATO requires for its own military. And with the situation on the ground deteriorating a Russian victory in Ukraine could come sooner than many predict possibly even before U.S. President Joe Biden ends his term.  However repeated warnings that should Ukraine lose Russia will reconstitute its land forces and be ready to attack NATO have resulted in little more than procrastination and indecisive action. And besides the countries along NATO s Eastern flank Europe s political leaders continue to behave as though not much has changed as their rhetoric has yet to be matched by commensurate action. Promises of future spending aren t the same as actual contracts that would impel European defense contractors to increase production at speed and scale. And without European rearmament NATO is simply setting itself up for failure. The U.S. and allied military leadership both at the U.S. European Command and the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe has worked tirelessly to return NATO to its original role of providing collective deterrence and defense. The alliance now has regional plans with force generation capabilities requirements that will restore this primary function. But if Europe doesn t spend the money to expand its defense industrial base and provide real military capabilities to make these new regional plans credible their execution will be fraught with unacceptable risk.  And yet judging by the uneven response from several European capitals regarding spending money on defense allies seem locked in a culture of talking big while relying on the U.S. to shoulder the lion s share of the burden. Today only 18 of NATO s 32 members are spending or have promised to spend the pledged 2 percent of GDP on defense. To put this in perspective during the Cold War European countries were spending on average 3 to 5 percent of GDP on defense. But allies signed on to these new plans at the last NATO summit in Vilnius which means the capabilities commitments attached to these plans are a binding pledge. Yet just three months before NATO s 75th anniversary summit in Washington this summer the alliance continues to struggle with shortfalls in integrated air and missile defense deep precision strikes command and control and logistics. Further still there s no genuine realization that NATO may fail in a crisis simply because it continues to come up short when it comes to rebuilding itself into a warfighting alliance. Broadly speaking among Europe s decisionmakers especially those in countries further away from the Eastern flank there seems to be little appreciation for the fact that this capabilities issue will be decisive in shaping NATO s future. Simply put without European allies transferring the burden of conventional deterrence and defense from the U.S. military to their own forces with the U.S. continuing to provide the nuclear deterrent and highend enablers NATO won t have the forces required to implement its new plans. Meanwhile the current debate of whether the U.S. should prioritize the Pacific or remain engaged in both the Atlantic and the Pacific theaters could become a zerosum game that come a crisis in Asia Europe will lose. Thus Europe s NATO allies need to move full speed ahead to resource their militaries. As long as the Russian imperial state exists in its current form the threat it poses to Europe won t go away. And whether or not Russia ultimately wins or loses in Ukraine whether it overruns the country controls some of its territory or is expelled altogether it will remain a chronic threat to peace until Moscow s revanchist drive is broken.  If Europe wants to avoid being pulled into a general fullscale war once again it must rearm at speed and scale. Without a genuine commitment to rearmament European NATO allies will continue to dither stuck debating institutional tweaks within the EU arguing over how much should be spent on defense and where to source their weapons and munitions all the while setting the conditions for NATO to fail.

https://www.semafor.com/article/04/21/2024/ukraine-can-prevail-with-us-support-nato-deputy-says, Ukraine will be positioned to prevail in its war against Russia and affirm themselves as an independent sovereign country thanks to the 60 billion in new aid the U.S. House passed Saturday according to a top NATO official.  We are very happy to see the support coming in NATO Deputy Secretary General Mircea Geoana told Semafor in an interview Sunday in Washington. He said it was up to Ukraine to define what prevailing in the war means echoing statements by other leaders. Geoana also acknowledged that Kyiv faces significant military challenges It has dealt with an increase in Russian drone attacks against energy infrastructure and other targets while running short on ammunition and air defense. Ukraine was forced to retreat from the city of Avdiivka earlier this year and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy recently said Ukraine was being outgunned by Russia 10 to 1 on artillery.  It s a difficult time we are not shying away from that observation but we know that they continue to be formidable Geoana said. With new U.S. support and plans by NATO allies to send more air defense systems he added I think they ll be in a situation to do it better and faster.  Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner DVa. indicated on CBS News that the U.S. will likely soon send longerrange missiles known as ATACMS to Ukraine once the Senate approves the aid package. The Housepassed bill calls on President Biden to send ATACMS to Ukraine as soon as practicable but allows him to avoid doing so if he determines it would be detrimental to the national security interests of the U.S. A Pentagon spokesman told Semafor that the U.S. is poised to respond with a package quickly after Congress passes the supplemental but that it is premature to speculate on the contents of any package at this time.  The Ukrainians and other European allies are breathing a sigh of relief following the U.S. House vote approving 60 billion in Ukraine aid on Saturday six months after the White House requested the support for Ukraine as it fights the Russian invasion. House Speaker Mike Johnson pressed past a threat from conservative members to oust him over the foreign aid vote relying on Democratic votes to carry the Ukraine package over the finish line. Ultimately 112 House Republicans voted against providing more aid to Ukraine slightly more than the number that voted in favor of it all Democrats voted in favor.  We would rather send bullets to the conflict overseas than our own boys our troops Johnson said on Saturday following the vote. Geoana said he did not think that the prolonged impasse over the funding was a sign that the U.S. had become a less reliable ally.  There always have been currents of isolationists currents of internationalists that s America and we are respectful of this thing he said. But I believe that NATO and America s connections to Europe are strong and I can anticipate many long long decades of a very vibrant NATO and a very very strong transatlantic alliance.  He also expressed doubts about a forthcoming Russian offensive and said Ukraine would be prepared to repel any effort should one materialize.  We have seen in the recent period a certain technical logistical advantage for Russia but nothing in decisive dosage to really provoke a massive change of the situation on the battlefield he said. Zelenskyy said Sunday on NBC News that Ukraine will have a chance for victory if it gets the weapon systems which we need so much. He mentioned longrange artillery and air defense and specifically praised the aid package for including language on ATACMS.  This aid will strengthen Ukraine and send the Kremlin a powerful signal that it will be the second Afghanistan the United States will stay with Ukraine will protect the Ukrainians and they will protect democracy in the world Zelenskyy said. The New York Times unpacked how Johnson came to support Ukraine aid through classified briefings reflections on his son s plans to attend the U.S. Naval Academy and prayer. Can Ukraine beat Russia with the renewed U.S. support and help from Europe? Maybe the Brookings Institution s Michael O Hanlon writes for the Washington Post.,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_headquarters, The NATO headquarters is the political and administrative center of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO. After previous locations in London and Paris it has been headquartered in Brussels since 1967 in a complex in Haren part of the City of Brussels along the Boulevard L opold IIILeopold IIIlaan. 1  The staff at the headquarters is composed of national delegations of NATO member states and includes civilian and military liaison offices and officers or diplomatic missions and diplomats of partner countries as well as the International Staff IS and International Military Staff IMS filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states. 2 Nongovernmental citizens groups have also grown up in support of NATO broadly under the banner of the Atlantic CouncilAtlantic Treaty Association movement. When NATO was established in 1949 London was the first location chosen for its headquarters. A 19thcentury mansion designed by the architect Thomas Cubitt at 13 Belgrave Square in the heart of the citys Belgravia neighborhood was made available to the organization. Nowadays this building houses the Ghana High Commission. 3  On 15 September 1950 at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council in New York City it was decided to establish the headquarters in Paris mainly because of the citys central position and its excellent means of communication. The move was officialized on 1 April 1952 coinciding with NATOs third anniversary. 5 In Paris the organization initially occupied temporary premises constructed along the reflecting pool of the Palais de Chaillot in the Trocad ro located across the Seine from the Eiffel Tower in the 16th arrondissement. 5  A permanent building donated by France in April 1954 was constructed at Porte Dauphine in the 16th arrondissement just off the Boulevard P riph rique and in the immediate vicinity of the Bois de Boulogne. The Palais Dauphine also known as the Palais de lOTAN NATO Palace was built between 1955 and 1957 according to the plans of the architect Jacques Carlu who had also previously designed the Palais de Chaillot. The building was Ashaped denoting alliance or allies. The organization moved there in 1959 only to leave it a few years later. 6 The building now serves as the main campus of Paris Dauphine University. 6  Following Frances decision to withdraw from NATOs Military Command Structure in 1966 the organization was once again forced to move its headquarters. 7 8 In December of that year the organization took the decision to set up its new headquarters in Brussels. Originally planned on the HeyselHeizel Plateau in Laeken they were temporarily built on the Boulevard L opold IIILeopold IIIlaan in the former municipality of Haren merged like Laeken with the City of Brussels in the northeastern part of Brussels. 9  After an international call for tenders NATO entrusted the construction of these new headquarters in March 1967 to two BelgianGermanDutch joint ventures. Work began immediately and was completed twentynine weeks later. The site owned by the Belgian Government and symbolically rented to NATO 5 was inaugurated on 16 October 1967. 10  Problems in the original building stemmed from its hurried construction in 1967. In 1999 during the Washington Summit the Heads of State and Government of the allied countries decided to replace the building with headquarters adapted to 21stcentury needs. 11 It was then decided to build new headquarters located just opposite the current ones on the site of the old terminals of the Haren 6 airfield. 12 13  A new 750 million headquarters building was constructed over the period between 2010 and summer 2016 14 and was dedicated on 25 May 2017 with a ceremony in the presence of allied Heads of State. SecretaryGeneral Jens Stoltenberg addressed the crowd while thenUS President Donald Trump hectored some among the crowd over their failure to live up to the 2 GDP target that was expected of them by their senior partner. 15 The cost of the new headquarters building escalated to about 1.1 billion. 11  The complex was designed by an international design consortium led by the US Firm of Skidmore Owings and Merrill including Jo Palma. Both Design and Construction were completed under the auspices of the Belgian Ministry of Defenses Project Management Team led by Colonel Christian LaNotte Belgian Army Engineers. Project Financing and Requirements definition as well as the Design and Construction Phases were overseen for NATO by its HQ Project Office led by Donald Hutchins CAPT US Navy Civil Engineer Corps Retired during the design Phase and Brigadier General Anthony Carruth British Army Engineer Retired during construction. Situated along the Boulevard L opold III in Haren part of the City of Brussels 1 the headquarters include 250000 m2 2700000 sq ft of floor space and is office and home to an international staff of 3800. 13 The Boulevard L opold III is a major dual carriageway linking via the A201 motorway the center of Brussels to its airport the latter being located just over 1 km 0.62 mi from the NATO site. Access can be done by taking the STIBMIVB bus lines 12 21 65 and the tram line 62 as well as the De Lijn network. The site is also approximately 80 km 50 mi north of NATOs military headquarters in Casteau near Mons still called Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe SHAPE although it now houses Allied Command Operations which directs NATOs military operations worldwide. 16  The staff at the Brussels headquarters primarily supports the North Atlantic Council and its subsidiary organisms. The International Staff provides advice guidance and administrative support to the NATO Secretary General. It works closely with the International Military Staff IMS.The first is primarily civilian the second primarily military filled from serving members of the armed forces of member states. 2 The IMS works to the instructions of the senior military body of the Alliance the Military Committee and its Chairman. There are also a host of national delegations liaison offices and diplomatic missions attached to the headquarters.,
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/poland-ready-to-host-nato-nuclear-weapons-president-andrzej-duda-says/,  April 22 2024 658 AM EDT AFP  Poland is ready to host nuclear arms if NATO decides to deploy the weapons in the face of Russia reinforcing its armaments in Belarus and Kaliningrad President Andrzej Duda said in an interview published Monday.  Poland a NATO member and staunch supporter of Ukraine shares a border with both Russias Kaliningrad exclave and with Belarus Moscows ally.  If our allies decide to deploy nuclear arms on our territory as part of nuclear sharing to reinforce NATOs eastern flank we are ready to do so Duda said in an interview published by the Fakt daily. Moscow in response warned it would take steps to ensure its security if Warsaw got the weapons.  Duda spoke to the Polish media after a visit to New York where he held meetings at the U.N. and discussed the war in Ukraine with former US president Donald Trump.  In March he visited Washington where he met with President Biden.  Discussions about nuclear cooperation between Poland and the United States have been ongoing for some time he said.  I have already talked about this several times. I must admit that when asked about it I declared our readiness Duda said.  Russia is increasingly militarizing Kaliningrad. Recently it has been relocating its nuclear weapons to Belarus he added.  The Kremlin said it would respond if Poland hosted nuclear weapons.  The military will of course analyse the situation and in any case will take all necessary response steps in order to ensure our security Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.  In June 2023 Russian President Vladimir Putin confirmed that Russia had sent tactical nuclear arms to Belarus which borders Ukraine and Poland.  During the last NATO summit in Vilnius the allies pledged to take all necessary steps to ensure the credibility effectiveness safety and security of the nuclear deterrent mission.

Top Questions What is NATO? The North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO is a military alliance originally established in 1949 to create a counterweight to Soviet armies stationed in central and eastern Europe after World War II. When the Cold War ended NATO was reconceived as a cooperativesecurity organization. The 32 current member states of NATO are Albania Belgium Bulgaria Canada Croatia the Czech Republic Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Greece Hungary Iceland Italy Latvia Lithuania Luxembourg Montenegro the Netherlands North Macedonia Norway Poland Portugal Romania Slovakia Slovenia Spain Sweden Turkey the United Kingdom and the United States. Sweden is the newest member of NATO. It joined the alliance as its 32nd member in March 2024. Sweden announced its intention to join NATO in 2022 in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine but its membership bid was held up for two years by objections from Turkey and Hungary. Finland joined NATO in April 2023 also in response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine. North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO military alliance established by the North Atlantic Treaty also called the Washington Treaty of April 4 1949 which sought to create a counterweight to Soviet armies stationed in central and eastern Europe after World War II. Its original members were Belgium Canada Denmark France Iceland Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Portugal the United Kingdom and the United States. Joining the original signatories were Greece and Turkey 1952 West Germany 1955 from 1990 as Germany Spain 1982 the Czech Republic Hungary and Poland 1999 Bulgaria Estonia Latvia Lithuania Romania Slovakia and Slovenia 2004 Albania and Croatia 2009 Montenegro 2017 North Macedonia 2020 Finland 2023 and Sweden 2024. France withdrew from the integrated military command of NATO in 1966 but remained a member of the organization it resumed its position in NATO s military command in 2009. The heart of NATO is expressed in Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty in which the signatory members agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that if such an armed attack occurs each of them in exercise of the right of individual or collective selfdefense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations will assist the Party or Parties so attacked by taking forthwith individually and in concert with the other Parties such action as it deems necessary including the use of armed force to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area. NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time in 2001 after the September 11 attacks organized by exiled Saudi Arabian millionaire Osama bin Laden destroyed the World Trade Center in New York City and part of the Pentagon outside Washington D.C. killing some 3000 people. Article 6 defines the geographic scope of the treaty as covering an armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America. Other articles commit the allies to strengthening their democratic institutions to building their collective military capability to consulting each other and to remaining open to inviting other European states to join. After World War II in 1945 western Europe was economically exhausted and militarily weak the western Allies had rapidly and drastically reduced their armies at the end of the war and newly powerful communist parties had arisen in France and Italy. By contrast the Soviet Union had emerged from the war with its armies dominating all the states of central and eastern Europe and by 1948 communists under Moscow s sponsorship had consolidated their control of the governments of those countries and suppressed all noncommunist political activity. What became known as the Iron Curtain a term popularized by Winston Churchill had descended over central and eastern Europe. Further wartime cooperation between the western Allies and the Soviets had completely broken down. Each side was organizing its own sector of occupied Germany so that two German states would emerge a democratic one in the west and a communist one in the east. In 1948 the United States launched the Marshall Plan which infused massive amounts of economic aid to the countries of western and southern Europe on the condition that they cooperate with each other and engage in joint planning to hasten their mutual recovery. As for military recovery under the Brussels Treaty of 1948 the United Kingdom France and the Low Countries Belgium the Netherlands and Luxembourg concluded a collectivedefense agreement called the Western European Union. It was soon recognized however that a more formidable alliance would be required to provide an adequate military counterweight to the Soviets. By this time Britain Canada and the United States had already engaged in secret exploratory talks on security arrangements that would serve as an alternative to the United Nations UN which was becoming paralyzed by the rapidly emerging Cold War. In March 1948 following a virtual communist coup d tat in Czechoslovakia in February the three governments began discussions on a multilateral collectivedefense scheme that would enhance Western security and promote democratic values. These discussions were eventually joined by France the Low Countries and Norway and in April 1949 resulted in the North Atlantic Treaty. Spurred by the North Korean invasion of South Korea in June 1950 see Korean War the United States took steps to demonstrate that it would resist any Soviet military expansion or pressures in Europe. Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower the leader of the Allied forces in western Europe in World War II was named Supreme Allied Commander Europe SACEUR by the North Atlantic Council NATO s governing body in December 1950. He was followed as SACEUR by a succession of American generals. The North Atlantic Council which was established soon after the treaty came into effect is composed of ministerial representatives of the member states who meet at least twice a year. At other times the council chaired by the NATO secretarygeneral remains in permanent session at the ambassadorial level. Just as the position of SACEUR has always been held by an American the secretarygeneralship has always been held by a European. NATO s military organization encompasses a complete system of commands for possible wartime use. The Military Committee consisting of representatives of the military chiefs of staff of the member states subsumes two strategic commands Allied Command Operations ACO and Allied Command Transformation ACT. ACO is headed by the SACEUR and located at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe SHAPE in Casteau Belgium. ACT is headquartered in Norfolk Virginia U.S. During the alliance s first 20 years more than 3 billion worth of infrastructure for NATO forces bases airfields pipelines communications networks depots was jointly planned financed and built with about onethird of the funding from the United States. NATO funding generally is not used for the procurement of military equipment which is provided by the member states though the NATO Airborne Early Warning Force a fleet of radarbearing aircraft designed to protect against a surprise lowflying attack was funded jointly.,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Member_states_of_NATO, NATO North Atlantic Treaty Organization is an international military alliance consisting of 32 member states from Europe and North America. It was established at the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949. Article 5 of the treaty states that if an armed attack occurs against one of the member states it shall be considered an attack against all members and other members shall assist the attacked member with armed forces if necessary. 1 Article 6 of the treaty limits the scope of Article 5 to the islands north of the Tropic of Cancer the North American and European mainlands the entirety of Turkey and French Algeria the last of which has been moot since July 1962. Thus an attack on Hawaii Puerto Rico French Guiana the Falkland Islands Ceuta or Melilla among other places would not trigger an Article 5 response. Of the 32 member countries 30 are in Europe and two are in North America. Between 1994 and 1997 wider forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbors were set up including the Partnership for Peace the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative and the EuroAtlantic Partnership Council. All members have militaries except for Iceland which does not have a typical army but it does have a coast guard and a small unit of civilian specialists for NATO operations. Three of NATOs members are nuclear weapons states France the United Kingdom and the United States. NATO has 12 original founding member states. Three more members joined between 1952 and 1955 and a fourth joined in 1982. Since the end of the Cold War NATO has added 16 more members from 1999 to 2024. 2  NATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina Georgia and Ukraine as aspiring members as part of their Open Doors enlargement policy. 3  NATO was established on 4 April 1949 via the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty Washington Treaty. The 12 founding members of the Alliance were Belgium Canada Denmark France Iceland Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Portugal the United Kingdom and the United States. 4  The various allies all sign the Ottawa Agreement 5 which is a 1951 document that acts to embody civilian oversight of the Alliance. 5 6  Current membership consists of 32 countries. In addition to the 12 founding countries four new members joined during the Cold War Greece and Turkey 1952 West Germany 1955 and Spain 1982. In 1990 the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. NATO further expanded after the Cold War adding the Czech Republic Hungary and Poland 1999 Bulgaria Estonia Latvia Lithuania Romania Slovakia and Slovenia 2004 Albania and Croatia 2009 Montenegro 2017 North Macedonia 2020 Finland 2023 and Sweden 2024. 4 Of the territories and members added between 1990 and 2024 all except for Finland and Sweden were either formerly part of the Warsaw Pact including the formerly Soviet Baltic states or territories of the former Yugoslavia. No countries have left NATO since its founding. Currently the North Atlantic Treaty Organization now covers a total area of 27580492 km2 10648887 sq mi since the accession of Sweden on 7 March 2024.  As of March 2024 update three additional states have formally informed NATO of their membership aspirations Bosnia and Herzegovina Georgia and Ukraine. 3  The current members and their dates of admission are listed below. The three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members Denmark Iceland and Norway chose to limit their participation in three areas there would be no permanent peacetime bases no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity unless invited permitted on their territory. However Denmark allowed the U.S. to maintain an existing base Thule Air Base now Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. 14  From the mid1960s to the mid1990s France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed GaulloMitterrandism. 15 Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009 the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom will not commit its nucleararmed submarines to the alliance. 16 17  The following list is constructed from The Military Balance published annually by the International Institute for Strategic Studies. Military spending of the US compared to 29 other NATO member countries all except Finland and Sweden US millions. q  Total military spending of NATO member countries except the United States Finland and Sweden US millions. q t  United States Finland and Sweden omitted see above The defence spending of the United States is more than double the defence spending of all other NATO members combined. 19 Criticism of the fact that many member states were not contributing their fair share in accordance with the international agreement by then US president Donald Trump caused various reactions from American and European political figures ranging from ridicule to panic. 20 21 22  Pew Research Centers 2016 survey among its member states showed that while most countries viewed NATO positively most NATO members preferred keeping their military spending the same. The response to whether their country should militarily aid another NATO country if it were to get into a serious military conflict with Russia was also mixed. Roughly half or fewer in six of the eight countries surveyed say their country should use military force if Russia attacks a neighboring country that is a NATO ally. And at least half in three of the eight NATO countries say that their government should not use military force in such circumstances. The strongest opposition to responding with armed force is in Germany 58 followed by France 53 and Italy 51. More than half of Americans 56 and Canadians 53 are willing to respond to Russian military aggression against a fellow NATO country. A plurality of the British 49 and Poles 48 would also live up to their Article 5 commitment. The Spanish are divided on the issue 48 support it 47 oppose. 26 27 ,

Eric Broder Van DykeiStockphotoGetty Images CNN Sweden became the newest member of NATO earlier this month joining 31 nations in the security alliance including the United States. Well make that 49 of the 50 United States.   Because in a quirk of geography and history Hawaii is not technically covered by the NATO pact.   If a foreign power attacked Hawaii say the US Navy s base at Pearl Harbor or the headquarters of the IndoPacific Command northwest of Honolulu the members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would not be obligated to rise to the Aloha State s defense.   It s the weirdest thing says David Santoro president of the Pacific Forum think tank in Honolulu who added that even most Hawaii residents have no idea their state is technically adrift of the alliance.   Sailors aboard the the USS Decatur render honors while passing the USS Arizona Memorial and the sunken battleship the USS Arizona during the 82nd Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day ceremony on Thursday December 7 2023 at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu Hawaii. Mengshin LinAP People tend to assume Hawaii is part of the US and therefore it s covered by NATO he says.   But he concedes the tipoff is in the alliance s name North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Hawaii is of course in the Pacific and unlike California Colorado or Alaska the 50th state is not part of the continental US that reaches the North Atlantic Ocean on its eastern shores.   The argument for not including Hawaii is simply that it s not part of North America Santoro says.   The exception is spelled out in the Washington Treaty the document that established NATO in 1949 a decade before Hawaii became a state.   While Article 5 of the treaty provides for collective selfdefense in the event of a military attack on any member state Article 6 limits the geographic scope of that.   An armed attack on one or more of the Parties is deemed to include an armed attack on the territory of any of the Parties in Europe or North America Article 6 says. It also says any island territories must be in the North Atlantic north of the Tropic of Cancer.   A US State Department spokesperson confirmed that Hawaii is not covered by Article 5 but said Article 4 which says members will consult when the territorial integrity political independence or security of any member is threatened should cover any situation that could affect the 50th state.   The spokesperson also said any treaty amendment to include Hawaii would be unlikely to gain consensus because other members have territories outside of the boundaries set in Article 5.   For instance NATO did not join founding member the United Kingdom s 1982 war with Argentina after Argentine troops invaded the Falkland Islands a disputed British territory in the South Atlantic.   NATO has not responded to a CNN request for comment.   Some experts say times have changed in the decades since the Washington Treaty was signed and argue today s political situation in the IndoPacific might require a rethink.   That s because US military bases in Hawaii could play a vital role in both countering North Korean aggression as well as supporting any potential defense of Taiwan.   China s ruling Communist Party claims the selfgoverning democratic island as its territory despite never having controlled it. Chinese leader Xi Jinping has made reunification with Taiwan a key part of his overarching goal to rejuvenate the nation by 2049.   While Chinese leaders have said they hope to take control of the island via peaceful means they have not ruled out doing so by force and have ramped up military intimidation of the island in recent years.   The Taiwan Relations Act obligates Washington to provide weaponry for the island s defense and US President Joe Biden has suggested he would use US military personnel to defend it in the event of a Chinese invasion though White House officials have said the US policy to leave that question ambiguous has not changed.   A 2022 wargame scenario run by the Center for a New American Security played out with China attacking US command and control installations in Hawaii as part of its war to take Taiwan by force.   Ministry of National Defense of the Peoples Republic of China Related article Two key military appointments from China s naval ranks reflects Xi s territorial ambitions analysts say   John Hemmings senior director of the IndoPacific Foreign and Security Policy Program at the Pacific Forum says Hawaii s exclusion from NATO removes an element of deterrence when it comes to the possibility of a Chinese strike on Hawaii in support of any potential Taiwan campaign.   Leaving Hawaii out lets Beijing know that NATO s European members potentially have a bit of an escape clause when it comes to defending US territory in such a hypothetical situation he says.   Why would we not put that element of deterrence at our disposal? Hemmings says. Why would we leave that off the table if it would actually stop China from an invasion of Taiwan?

From left to right the USS West Virginia the USS Tennessee and the USS Arizona. US NavyInterim ArchivesGetty Images Hawaii s strategic importance also has deep historical significance for the US. This is where Pearl Harbor happened. This is where we were attacked that brought us into the Second World War and by the way this is what also led to us to help liberate France he says.   For Americans there is a direct link between this state and our involvement in the Second World War and ultimately our help in contributing to the victory over the Axis the alliance of Nazi Germany Japan and Italy.   Hemmings also makes an argument for Guam the US Pacific island territory some 3000 miles farther west than Hawaii to be included in NATO s umbrella.   The island which has long been a focal point of North Korean saber rattling is home to Andersen Air Force Base from which the US can launch its B1 B2 and B52 bombers across the IndoPacific.   Hemmings likens Guam s exclusion from NATO to how the US left the Korean Peninsula outside of a line it drew across the Pacific to deter the Soviet Union and China from spreading communism in January 1950. Five months after the socalled Acheson Line was drawn the Korean War began.   The adversary feels emboldened to carry out military conflict and you end up having a war anyway Hemmings says.   The Pacific Forum s Santoro also mentions Guam should be included under the NATO umbrella. Strategically Guam absolutely matters a lot more than Hawaii he says.

Master Sgt. Amy PicardU.S. Air Force Coalition of the willing Other analysts argue that were such a hypothetical attack to take place on Hawaii or Guam the deep and abiding ties that bind the US and its democratic allies would be substantially more significant in countries decisionmaking than a technicality in the NATO treaty.   In the event of an attack I would expect the United States to try to put together a coalition of the willing involving primarily but certainly not exclusively regional allies says Luis Simon a director of the Research Centre for Security Diplomacy and Strategy at the Brussels School of Governance in Belgium.   Simon cites the alliance s strong and immediate response after the 911 attacks the only time in its 74year history that NATO has triggered the collective selfdefense mechanism under Article 5.

JONATHAN ERNSTAFPGetty Images JONATHAN ERNSTAFPAFPGetty Images Related article NATO Fast Facts   But Washington actually chose to channel its response through a coalition of the willing and not through NATO Command he says. I suspect we d see a similar reaction in the case of an attack on either Guam or Hawaii with the US wanting to retain full military control over the response and diplomatic flexibility.   Simon also says he doesn t see any real daylight between NATO members and their commitment to the US and the alliance.   NATO is a bedrock of the transatlantic democratic community. The US and other NATO members have touted unprecedented unity among the alliance in the face of Russia s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. And NATO has also hardened its shared rhetoric on China in recent years vowing to address what they describe as the systemic challenges Beijing poses.   I personally have little doubt they would be ready to provide different forms of assistance in case of an attack against US sovereign territory including individually and through multilateral venues like the European Union or NATO he says.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO, The North Atlantic Treaty Organization NATO ne to NAYtoh French Organisation du trait de lAtlantique nord OTAN also called the North Atlantic Alliance is an intergovernmental military alliance of 32 member states 30 European and 2 North American. Established in the aftermath of World War II the organization implements the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington D.C. on 4 April 1949. 4 5 NATO is a collective security system its independent member states agree to defend each other against attacks by third parties. During the Cold War NATO operated as a check on the threat posed by the Soviet Union. The alliance remained in place after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact and has been involved in military operations in the Balkans the Middle East South Asia and Africa. The organizations motto is animus in consulendo liber Latin for a mind unfettered in deliberation . 6 The organizations strategic concepts include deterrence. 7  NATOs main headquarters are located in Brussels Belgium while NATOs military headquarters are near Mons Belgium. The alliance has increased its NATO Response Force deployments in Eastern Europe 8 and the combined militaries of all NATO members include around 3.5 million soldiers and personnel. 9 All member states together cover an area of 25.07 million km and about 966.88 million people. 10 Their combined military spending as of 2022 update constituted around 55 percent of the global nominal total. 11 Moreover members have agreed to reach or maintain the target defence spending of at least two percent of their GDP by 2024. 12 13  NATO formed with twelve founding members and has added new members ten times most recently when Sweden joined the alliance on 7 March 2024. 14 In addition NATO currently recognizes Bosnia and Herzegovina Georgia and Ukraine as aspiring members. 4 Enlargement has led to tensions with nonmember Russia one of the 18 additional countries participating in NATOs Partnership for Peace programme. Another nineteen countries are involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes with NATO. The Treaty of Dunkirk was signed by France and the United Kingdom on 4 March 1947 during the aftermath of World War II and the start of the Cold War as a Treaty of Alliance and Mutual Assistance in the event of possible attacks by Germany or the Soviet Union. In March 1948 this alliance was expanded in the Treaty of Brussels to include the Benelux countries forming the Brussels Treaty Organization commonly known as the Western Union. 15 Talks for a wider military alliance which could include North America also began that month in the United States where their foreign policy under the Truman Doctrine promoted international solidarity against actions they saw as communist aggression such as the February 1948 coup d tat in Czechoslovakia. These talks resulted in the signature of the North Atlantic Treaty on 4 April 1949 by the member states of the Western Union plus the United States Canada Portugal Italy Norway Denmark and Iceland. 16 Canadian diplomat Lester B. Pearson was a key author and drafter of the treaty. 17 18 19  The North Atlantic Treaty was largely dormant until the Korean War initiated the establishment of NATO to implement it with an integrated military structure. This included the formation of Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe SHAPE in 1951 which adopted many of the Western Unions military structures and plans 20 including their agreements on standardizing equipment and agreements on stationing foreign military forces in European countries. In 1952 the post of Secretary General of NATO was established as the organizations chief civilian. That year also saw the first major NATO maritime exercises Exercise Mainbrace and the accession of Greece and Turkey to the organization. 21 22 Following the London and Paris Conferences West Germany was permitted to rearm militarily as they joined NATO in May 1955 which was in turn a major factor in the creation of the Sovietdominated Warsaw Pact delineating the two opposing sides of the Cold War. 23  The building of the Berlin Wall in 1961 marked a height in Cold War tensions when 400000 US troops were stationed in Europe. 24 Doubts over the strength of the relationship between the European states and the United States ebbed and flowed along with doubts over the credibility of the NATO defence against a prospective Soviet invasion doubts that led to the development of the independent French nuclear deterrent and the withdrawal of France from NATOs military structure in 1966. 25 26 In 1982 the newly democratic Spain joined the alliance. 27  The Revolutions of 1989 in Europe led to a strategic reevaluation of NATOs purpose nature tasks and focus on the continent. In October 1990 East Germany became part of the Federal Republic of Germany and the alliance and in November 1990 the alliance signed the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe CFE in Paris with the Soviet Union. It mandated specific military reductions across the continent which continued after the collapse of the Warsaw Pact in February 1991 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union that December which removed the de facto main adversaries of NATO. 28 This began a drawdown of military spending and equipment in Europe. The CFE treaty allowed signatories to remove 52000 pieces of conventional armaments in the following sixteen years 29 and allowed military spending by NATOs European members to decline by 28 percent from 1990 to 2015. 30 In 1990 several Western leaders gave assurances to Mikhail Gorbachev that NATO would not expand further east as revealed by memoranda of private conversations. 31 32 33 34  In the 1990s the organization extended its activities into political and humanitarian situations that had not formerly been NATO concerns. 35 During the breakup of Yugoslavia the organization conducted its first military interventions in Bosnia from 1992 to 1995 and later Yugoslavia in 1999. 36  Politically the organization sought better relations with the newly autonomous Central and Eastern European states and diplomatic forums for regional cooperation between NATO and its neighbours were set up during this postCold War period including the Partnership for Peace and the Mediterranean Dialogue initiative in 1994 the EuroAtlantic Partnership Council in 1997 and the NATO Russia Permanent Joint Council in 1998. At the 1999 Washington summit Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic officially joined NATO and the organization also issued new guidelines for membership with individualized Membership Action Plans. These plans governed the subsequent addition of new alliance members. 37  Article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty requiring member states to come to the aid of any member state subject to an armed attack was invoked for the first and only time after the September 11 attacks 38 after which troops were deployed to Afghanistan under the NATOled ISAF. The organization has operated a range of additional roles since then including sending trainers to Iraq assisting in counterpiracy operations. 39  The election of French president Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007 led to a major reform of Frances military position culminating with the return to full membership on 4 April 2009 which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent. 26 40 41  The 2014 Russias annexation of Crimea led to strong condemnation by all NATO members 42 and was one of the seven times that Article 4 which calls for consultation among NATO members has been invoked. Prior times included during the Iraq War and Syrian Civil War. 43 At the 2014 Wales summit the leaders of NATOs member states formally committed for the first time to spend the equivalent of at least two percent of their gross domestic products on defence by 2024 which had previously been only an informal guideline. 44 At the 2016 Warsaw summit NATO countries agreed on the creation of NATO Enhanced Forward Presence which deployed four multinational battalionsized battlegroups in Estonia Latvia Lithuania and Poland. 45 Before and during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine several NATO countries sent ground troops warships and fighter aircraft to reinforce the alliances eastern flank and multiple countries again invoked Article 4. 46 47 48 In March 2022 NATO leaders met at Brussels for an extraordinary summit which also involved Group of Seven and European Union leaders. 49 NATO member states agreed to establish four additional battlegroups in Bulgaria Hungary Romania and Slovakia 45 and elements of the NATO Response Force were activated for the first time in NATOs history. 50  As of June 2022 NATO had deployed 40000 troops along its 2500kilometrelong 1550 mi Eastern flank to deter Russian aggression. More than half of this number have been deployed in Bulgaria Romania Hungary Slovakia and Poland which five countries muster a considerable combined exNATO force of 259000 troops. To supplement Bulgarias Air Force Spain sent Eurofighter Typhoons the Netherlands sent eight F35 attack aircraft and additional French and US attack aircraft would arrive soon as well. 51  No military operations were conducted by NATO during the Cold War. Following the end of the Cold War the first operations Anchor Guard in 1990 and Ace Guard in 1991 were prompted by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Airborne early warning aircraft were sent to provide coverage of southeastern Turkey and later a quickreaction force was deployed to the area. 52  The Bosnian War began in 1992 as a result of the breakup of Yugoslavia. The deteriorating situation led to United Nations Security Council Resolution 816 on 9 October 1992 authorizing its memberstates to enforce a previously declared nofly zone under the United Nations Protection Force over central Bosnia and Herzegovina. NATO complied and started enforcing the ban on 12 April 1993 with Operation Deny Flight. From June 1993 until October 1996 Operation Sharp Guard added maritime enforcement of the arms embargo and economic sanctions against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. On 28 February 1994 NATO took its first wartime action by shooting down four Bosnian Serb aircraft violating the nofly zone. 53  On 10 and 11 April 1994 the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes to protect the Gora de safe area resulting in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Gora de by two US F16 jets acting under NATO direction. 54 In retaliation Serbs took 150 U.N. personnel hostage on 14 April. 55 56 On 16 April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Gora de by Serb forces. 57  In August 1995 a twoweek NATO bombing campaign Operation Deliberate Force began against the Army of the Republika Srpska after the Srebrenica genocide. 58 Further NATO air strikes helped bring the Yugoslav Wars to an end resulting in the Dayton Agreement in November 1995. 58 As part of this agreement NATO deployed a UNmandated peacekeeping force under Operation Joint Endeavor named IFOR. Almost 60000 NATO troops were joined by forces from nonNATO countries in this peacekeeping mission. This transitioned into the smaller SFOR which started with 32000 troops initially and ran from December 1996 until December 2004 when operations were then passed onto the European Union Force Althea. 59 Following the lead of its member states NATO began to award a service medal the NATO Medal for these operations. 60  In an effort to stop Slobodan Milo evi s Serbianled crackdown on KLA separatists and Albanian civilians in Kosovo the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1199 on 23 September 1998 to demand a ceasefire. citation needed  Negotiations under US Special Envoy Richard Holbrooke broke down on 23 March 1999 and he handed the matter to NATO 61 which acted on protecting regional security and started a 78day bombing campaign on 24 March 1999. 62 Operation Allied Force targeted the military capabilities of what was then the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. During the crisis NATO also deployed one of its international reaction forces the ACE Mobile Force Land to Albania as the Albania Force AFOR to deliver humanitarian aid to refugees from Kosovo. 63  The campaign was and has been criticized over its civilian casualties including the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade and over whether it had legitimacy.The US the UK and most other NATO countries opposed efforts to require the UN Security Council to approve NATO military strikes such as the action against Serbia in 1999 while France and some others claimed that the alliance needed UN approval. 64 The USUK side claimed that this would undermine the authority of the alliance and they noted that Russia and China would have exercised their Security Council vetoes to block the strike on Yugoslavia and could do the same in future conflicts where NATO intervention was required thus nullifying the entire potency and purpose of the organization. Recognizing the postCold War military environment NATO adopted the Alliance Strategic Concept during its Washington summit in April 1999 that emphasized conflict prevention and crisis management. 65  Milo evi finally accepted the terms of an international peace plan on 3 June 1999 ending the Kosovo War. On 11 June Milo evi further accepted UN resolution 1244 under the mandate of which NATO then helped establish the KFOR peacekeeping force. Nearly one million refugees had fled Kosovo and part of KFORs mandate was to protect the humanitarian missions in addition to deterring violence. 66 In August September 2001 the alliance also mounted Operation Essential Harvest a mission disarming ethnic Albanian militias in the Republic of Macedonia. 67 As of 2023 update around 4500 KFOR soldiers representing 27 countries continue to operate in the area. 68  The September 11 attacks in the United States caused NATO to invoke Article 5 of the NATO Charter for the first time in the organizations history. 69 The Article states that an attack on any member shall be considered to be an attack on all. The invocation was confirmed on 4 October 2001 when NATO determined that the attacks were indeed eligible under the terms of the North Atlantic Treaty. 70 The eight official actions taken by NATO in response to the attacks included Operation Eagle Assist and Operation Active Endeavour a naval operation in the Mediterranean Sea designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction and to enhance the security of shipping in general which began on 4 October 2001. 52  The alliance showed unity on 16 April 2003 NATO agreed to take command of the International Security Assistance Force ISAF which included troops from 42 countries. The decision came at the request of Germany and the Netherlands the two countries leading ISAF at the time of the agreement and all nineteen NATO ambassadors approved it unanimously. The handover of control to NATO took place on 11 August and marked the first time in NATOs history that it took charge of a mission outside the north Atlantic area. 71  ISAF was initially charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas from the Taliban al Qaeda and factional warlords so as to allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003 the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan 72 and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country. 73  On 31 July 2006 the ISAF additionally took over military operations in the south of Afghanistan from a USled antiterrorism coalition. 74 Due to the intensity of the fighting in the south in 2011 France allowed a squadron of Mirage 2000 fighterattack aircraft to be moved into the area to Kandahar in order to reinforce the alliances efforts. 75 During its 2012 Chicago Summit NATO endorsed a plan to end the Afghanistan war and to remove the NATOled ISAF Forces by the end of December 2014. 76 ISAF was disestablished in December 2014 and replaced by the followon training Resolute Support Mission. 77  On 14 April 2021 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had agreed to start withdrawing its troops from Afghanistan by 1 May. 78 Soon after the withdrawal of NATO troops started the Taliban launched an offensive against the Afghan government quickly advancing in front of collapsing Afghan Armed Forces. 79 By 15 August 2021 Taliban militants controlled the vast majority of Afghanistan and had encircled the capital city of Kabul. 80 Some politicians in NATO member states have described the chaotic withdrawal of Western troops from Afghanistan and the collapse of the Afghan government as the greatest debacle that NATO has suffered since its founding. 81 82  In August 2004 during the Iraq War NATO formed the NATO Training Mission Iraq a training mission to assist the Iraqi security forces in conjunction with the USled MNFI. 83 The NATO Training MissionIraq NTMI was established at the request of the Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTMI was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the country. NTMI was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission under the political control of the North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the USled Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training who was also dualhatted as the Commander of NTMI. The mission officially concluded on 17 December 2011. 84  Turkey invoked the first Article 4 meetings in 2003 at the start of the Iraq War. Turkey also invoked this article twice in 2012 during the Syrian Civil War after the downing of an unarmed Turkish F4 reconnaissance jet and after a mortar was fired at Turkey from Syria 85 and again in 2015 after threats by Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant to its territorial integrity. 86  In 2008 the United Nations SecretaryGeneral called on memberstates to protect the ships of Operation Allied Provider which was distributing aid as part of the World Food Programme mission in Somalia. 87  The North Atlantic Council and other countries including Russia China and South Korea 88 89 formed Operation Ocean Shield. The operation sought to dissuade and interrupt pirate attacks protect vessels and to increase the general level of security in the region. 90 Beginning on 17 August 2009 NATO deployed warships in an operation to protect maritime traffic in the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean from Somali pirates and help strengthen the navies and coast guards of regional states. citation needed  During the Libyan Civil War violence between protesters and the Libyan government under Colonel Muammar Gaddafi escalated and on 17 March 2011 led to the passage of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 which called for a ceasefire and authorized military action to protect civilians. A coalition that included several NATO members began enforcing a nofly zone over Libya shortly afterwards beginning with Op ration Harmattan by the French Air Force on 19 March. citation needed  On 20 March 2011 NATO states agreed on enforcing an arms embargo against Libya with Operation Unified Protector using ships from NATO Standing Maritime Group 1 and Standing Mine Countermeasures Group 1 91 and additional ships and submarines from NATO members. 92 They would monitor report and if needed interdict vessels suspected of carrying illegal arms or mercenaries. 91  On 24 March NATO agreed to take control of the nofly zone from the initial coalition while command of targeting ground units remained with the coalitions forces. 93 94 NATO began officially enforcing the UN resolution on 27 March 2011 with assistance from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. 95 By June reports of divisions within the alliance surfaced as only eight of the 28 member states were participating in combat operations 96 resulting in a confrontation between US Defense Secretary Robert Gates and countries such as Poland Spain the Netherlands Turkey and Germany with Gates calling on the latter to contribute more and the latter believing the organization has overstepped its mandate in the conflict. 97 98 99 In his final policy speech in Brussels on 10 June Gates further criticized allied countries in suggesting their actions could cause the demise of NATO. 100 The German foreign ministry pointed to a considerable German contribution to NATO and NATOled operations and to the fact that this engagement was highly valued by President Obama. 101  While the mission was extended into September Norway that day 10 June announced it would begin scaling down contributions and complete withdrawal by 1 August. 102 Earlier that week it was reported Danish air fighters were running out of bombs. 103 104 The following week the head of the Royal Navy said the countrys operations in the conflict were not sustainable. 105 By the end of the mission in October 2011 after the death of Colonel Gaddafi NATO planes had flown about 9500 strike sorties against proGaddafi targets. 106 107 A report from the organization Human Rights Watch in May 2012 identified at least 72 civilians killed in the campaign. 108  Following a coup d tat attempt in October 2013 Libyan Prime Minister Ali Zeidan requested technical advice and trainers from NATO to assist with ongoing security issues. 109  Use of Article 5 has been threatened multiple times and four out of seven official Article 4 consultations have been called due to spillover in Turkey from the Syrian civil war. In April 2012 Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo an considered invoking Article 5 of the NATO treaty to protect Turkish national security in a dispute over the Syrian Civil War. 110 111 The alliance responded quickly and a spokesperson said the alliance was monitoring the situation very closely and will continue to do so and takes it very seriously protecting its members. 112  After the shooting down of a Turkish military jet by Syria in June 2012 and Syrian forces shelling Turkish cities in October 2012 113 resulting in two Article 4 consultations NATO approved Operation Active Fence. In the past decade the conflict has only escalated. In response to the 2015 Suru bombing which Turkey attributed to ISIS and other security issues along its southern border 114 115 116 117 Turkey called for an emergency meeting. The latest consultation happened in February 2020 as part of increasing tensions due to the Northwestern Syria offensive which involved 118 Syrian and suspected Russian airstrikes on Turkish troops and risked direct confrontation between Russia and a NATO member. 119  NATO has thirtytwo members mostly in Europe with two in North America. Some of these countries also have territory on other continents which is covered by the security agreements only as far south as the Tropic of Cancer which together with the Atlantic Ocean defines NATOs area of responsibility under Article 6 of the North Atlantic Treaty. During the original treaty negotiations the United States insisted that colonies such as the Belgian Congo be excluded from the treaty. 120 121 French Algeria was however covered until its independence on 3 July 1962. 122 Twelve of these thirtytwo are original members who joined in 1949 while the other twenty joined in one of ten enlargement rounds. 123  The three Nordic countries which joined NATO as founding members Denmark Iceland and Norway chose to limit their participation in three areas there would be no permanent peacetime bases no nuclear warheads and no Allied military activity unless invited permitted on their territory. However Denmark allows the U.S. Space Force to maintain Pituffik Space Base in Greenland. 124  From the mid1960s to the mid1990s France pursued a military strategy of independence from NATO under a policy dubbed GaulloMitterrandism. 125 Nicolas Sarkozy negotiated the return of France to the integrated military command and the Defence Planning Committee in 2009 the latter being disbanded the following year. France remains the only NATO member outside the Nuclear Planning Group and unlike the United States and the United Kingdom will not commit its nucleararmed submarines to the alliance. 26 40  NATO was established on 4 April 1949 by the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty Washington Treaty. The 12 founding members of the alliance were Belgium Canada Denmark France Iceland Italy Luxembourg the Netherlands Norway Portugal the United Kingdom and the United States. 126  Four new members joined during the Cold War Greece 1952 Turkey 1952 West Germany 1955 and Spain 1982. Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union many former Warsaw Pact and postSoviet states sought membership. In 1990 the territory of the former East Germany was added with the reunification of Germany. At the 1999 Washington summit Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic officially joined and NATO issued new guidelines for membership with individualized Membership Action Plans. These plans governed the addition of new members Bulgaria Estonia Latvia Lithuania Romania Slovakia and Slovenia in 2004 Albania and Croatia in 2009 Montenegro in 2017 and North Macedonia in 2020. 127 Finland and Sweden are the newest members joining on 4 April 2023 and 7 March 2024 respectively spurred on by Russias invasion of Ukraine. 128 14  Ukraines relationship with NATO began with the NATO Ukraine Action Plan in 2002. 129 In 2010 under President Viktor Yanukovych Ukraine reaffirmed its nonaligned status and renounced aspirations of joining NATO. 130 During the 2014 Ukrainian Revolution Russia occupied Crimea and supported armed separatists in eastern Ukraine. As a result in December 2014 Ukraines parliament voted to end its nonaligned status 131 and in 2019 it enshrined the goal of NATO membership in the Constitution. 132 133 At the June 2021 Brussels Summit NATO leaders affirmed that Ukraine would eventually join the Alliance and supported Ukraines right to selfdetermination without interference. 134 In late 2021 there was another massive Russian military buildup near Ukraines borders. On 30 November Russian president Putin said Ukraine joining NATO and the deployment of missile defense systems or longrange missiles in Ukraine would be crossing a red line. However there were no such plans to deploy missiles in Ukraine. 135 136 137 The Russian Foreign Ministry drafted a treaty that would forbid Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining NATO. 138 SecretaryGeneral Stoltenberg replied that the decision is up to Ukraine and NATO members adding Russia has no veto Russia has no say and Russia has no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbors. 139 140 NATO offered to improve communications with Russia and discuss missile placements and military exercises as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraines borders. 141 Instead Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Ukraine applied for NATO membership in September 2022 after Russia proclaimed it had annexed the countrys southeast. 142  Georgia was promised future membership during the 2008 summit in Bucharest 143 but US president Barack Obama said in 2014 that the country was not currently on a path to membership. 144  Russia continued to politically oppose further expansion seeing it as inconsistent with informal understandings between Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and European and US negotiators that allowed for a peaceful German reunification. 145 A June 2016 Levada Center poll found that 68 percent of Russians think that deploying NATO troops in the Baltic states and Poland former Eastern bloc countries bordering Russia is a threat to Russia. 146 In contrast 65 percent of Poles surveyed in a 2017 Pew Research Center report identified Russia as a major threat with an average of 31 percent saying so across all NATO countries 147 and 67 percent of Poles surveyed in 2018 favour US forces being based in Poland. 148 Of nonCIS Eastern European countries surveyed by Gallup in 2016 all but Serbia and Montenegro were more likely than not to view NATO as a protective alliance rather than a threat. 149 A 2006 study in the journal Security Studies argued that NATO enlargement contributed to democratic consolidation in Central and Eastern Europe. 150 China also opposes further expansion. 151  Member states pay for NATOs three common funds the civil and military budgets and the security investment program based on a costsharing formula that includes per capita gross national income and other factors. 152 153 In 2023 2024 the United States and Germany were the biggest contributors with 16.2 each. 153 154  Member states pay for and maintain their own troops and equipment. 153 154 They contribute to NATO operations and missions by committing troops and equipment on a voluntary basis. 154 Since 2006 the goal has been for each country to spend at least 2 percent of its gross domestic product on its own defense in 2014 a NATO declaration said that countries not meeting the goal would aim to move towards the 2 percent guideline within a decade. 153 155 In July 2022 NATO estimated that 11 members would meet the target in 2023. 155 On 14 February 2024 NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said that 18 member states would meet the 2 target in 2024. 156  The Partnership for Peace PfP programme was established in 1994 and is based on individual bilateral relations between each partner country and NATO each country may choose the extent of its participation. 158 Members include all current and former members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 159 The EuroAtlantic Partnership Council EAPC was first established on 29 May 1997 and is a forum for regular coordination consultation and dialogue between all fifty participants. 160 The PfP programme is considered the operational wing of the EuroAtlantic Partnership. 158 Other third countries have also been contacted for participation in some activities of the PfP framework such as Afghanistan. 161  The European Union EU signed a comprehensive package of arrangements with NATO under the Berlin Plus agreement on 16 December 2002. With this agreement the EU was given the possibility of using NATO assets if it wanted to act independently in an international crisis on the condition that NATO itself did not want to act the socalled right of first refusal. 162 For example Article 427 of the 1982 Treaty of Lisbon specifies that If a Member State is the victim of armed aggression on its territory the other Member States shall have towards it an obligation of aid and assistance by all the means in their power. The treaty applies globally to specified territories whereas NATO is restricted under its Article 6 to operations north of the Tropic of Cancer. It provides a double framework for the EU countries that are also linked with the PfP programme. 163 164  Additionally NATO cooperates and discusses its activities with numerous other nonNATO members. The Mediterranean Dialogue was established in 1994 to coordinate in a similar way with Israel and countries in North Africa. The Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was announced in 2004 as a dialogue forum for the Middle East along the same lines as the Mediterranean Dialogue. The four participants are also linked through the Gulf Cooperation Council. 165 In June 2018 Qatar expressed a wish to join NATO 166 who ruled it out saying that only additional European countries could join according to Article 10 of NATOs founding treaty. 167 Qatar and NATO had earlier signed a joint security agreement in January 2018. 168  Political dialogue with Japan began in 1990 and since then the Alliance has gradually increased its contact with countries that do not form part of any of these cooperation initiatives. 169 In 1998 NATO established a set of general guidelines that do not allow for a formal institutionalization of relations but reflect the Allies desire to increase cooperation. Following extensive debate the term Contact Countries was agreed by the Allies in 2000. By 2012 the Alliance had broadened this group which meets to discuss issues such as counterpiracy and technology exchange under the names global partners or partners across the globe. 170 171 Australia and New Zealand both contact countries are also members of the AUSCANNZUKUS strategic alliance and similar regional or bilateral agreements between contact countries and NATO members also aid cooperation. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg stated that NATO needs to address the rise of China by closely cooperating with Australia New Zealand Japan and South Korea. 172 Colombia is NATOs latest partner and has access to the full range of cooperative activities offered it is the first and only Latin American country to cooperate with NATO. 173 174  All agencies and organizations of NATO are integrated into either the civilian administrative or military executive roles. For the most part they perform roles and functions that directly or indirectly support the security role of the alliance as a whole. citation needed  NATO is an alliance of 32 sovereign states and their individual sovereignty is unaffected by participation in the alliance. NATO has no parliaments no laws no enforcement and no power to punish individual citizens. As a consequence of this lack of sovereignty the power and authority of a NATO commander are limited. NATO commanders cannot punish offences such as failure to obey a lawful order dereliction of duty or disrespect to a senior officer. 188 NATO commanders expect obeisance but sometimes need to subordinate their desires or plans to the operators who are themselves subject to sovereign codes of conduct like the UCMJ. A case in point was the clash between General Sir Mike Jackson and General Wesley Clark over KFOR actions at Pristina Airport. 189  NATO commanders can issue orders to their subordinate commanders in the form of operational plans OPLANs operational orders OPORDERs tactical direction or fragmental orders FRAGOs and others. The joint rules of engagement must be followed and the Law of Armed Conflict must be obeyed at all times. Operational resources remain under national command but have been transferred temporarily to NATO. Although these national units through the formal process of transfer of authority have been placed under the operational command and control of a NATO commander they never lose their national character. Senior national representatives like CDS are designated as socalled redcardholders. Caveats are restrictions listed nation by nation... that NATO Commanders... must take into account. 188 ,
