AP PhotoNg Han Guan  By ELAINE KURTENBACH Updated hourminute AMPM timezone monthFull day year Share Share Copy Link copied Email Facebook X Reddit LinkedIn Pinterest Flipboard Print BEIJING AP China s blueprint for its economy in 2024 is replete with goals and promises but it s also notable for not spelling out specific moves to attain longpromised reforms that foreign businesses and investors have been hoping for. The work report presented Tuesday by Premier Li Qiang to the National People s Congress outlined plans for modest increases in overall spending and a hefty 7.2 jump in funding for the military. The ruling Communist Party s target is to grow the economy by about 5 this year an ambition that economists say may be hard to attain. Li said China also will focus on supporting research and industries to attain breakthroughs in key technologies including computer chips.  Such goals are in line with leader Xi Jinping s aim to strengthen China s selfreliance and power in advanced technologies as Beijing and Washington spar over technology and national security concerns. Li s work report is designed to showcase for the nation achievements in the past year and convey the top leadership s priorities for this year. But it also provides insights into the direction of policies that affect both domestic and foreign companies.   IMF s Georgieva says there s plenty to worry about despite recovery for many economies IMF Outlook for world economy is brighter though still modest by historical standards China s economy grew 5.3 in first quarter beating expectations though weak spots remain The speech did little to address concerns that have led foreign businesses to reconsider their investment strategies in China said James Zimmerman a lawyer and former head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Beijing.  Apart from the ambitious growth target There is no reform no liberalization no action plan and no messaging of reassurance he said. One can only guess that the strategy is to stay the course and hope that things will correct themselves.  A decision to cancel the annual news conference by the premier that usually wraps up after the congress finishes has added to a sense of diminishing transparency he said.  Tianchen Xu of the Economist Intelligence Unit said the report mostly reiterated what the government has been saying for the past six to nine months. What s needed are moves to liberalize investment in telecommunications and healthcare for example or laws to ensure private businesses are able to collect on unpaid debts.   The key is that strong commitments need to be matched by actions we haven t seen much progress so far Xu said in an emailed comment. Chinese markets have languished in recent months and shares in Hong Kong fell on heavy selling of technology stocks Tuesday with the benchmark Hang Seng index sinking 2.6.  Ecommerce giant Alibaba lost 3.3 Baidu fell 5.7 and JD.com another major ecommerce company lost 7.5.   There was little surprise that the GDP growth target was set at around 5 again as lowering the target would have further weakened confidence Lynn Song chief economist for Greater China at ING Economics said in a report. She noted that some of the postpandemic help for the economy will be missing this year and exports may not be much help with forecasts for global demand to be below average.   With that said it will be a more challenging path to repeating 5 growth in 2024 she said. While we saw some positive signals in the government work report a road to restoring confidence will likely take some time and the process will likely be uneven.   China will encourage consumers to scrap old appliances and trade in their cars for electric vehicles and other new products to help spur more domestic demand.  The government will boost spending on research and development by 10.   Military spending is due to increase by 7.2 in line with the previous year s rate of growth to 1.67 trillion yuan 232 billion.   The government will issue 1 trillion yuan 139 billion in ultra longterm special bonds in this year and coming years to support major national strategies and build security capacity in key industries.  Another 10.4 billion yuan 1.4 billion will go to upgrading industries and modernizing manufacturing. The report also said China will encourage more venture capital and equity investment and use marketbased measures to promote faster development of computer chip manufacturing and advanced information technology.   We will work to build China s selfreliance and strength in science and technology the report said.  The report which is due to be endorsed by the congress when it wraps up next week sets a goal of reducing China s energy consumption this year by 2.5 and moving toward carbon neutrality in reducing emissions that contribute to climate change.   We will support a new round of strategic initiatives aimed at breakthroughs in mineral exploration promote the development of clean and renewable energy and facilitate faster progress in building a new energy system it said.,
https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/11/key-takeaways-from-2024-china-parliamentary-meeting-economy-environment.html, BEIJING China s weeklong annual parliamentary meetings ended on Monday and for the first time in decades the Chinese premier did not host a press conference. In a break with tradition the premier will no longer hold a press conference following this year s parliamentary meetings at least for the rest of the term according to an official announcement last week. Such press conferences were a rare instance of press interaction with the highest levels of China s government. President Xi Jinping did not speak at the closing ceremony. He typically speaks only at the closing ceremonies of the first session of each National People s Congress the nation s highest authority which is elected every five years. This year is the second session of the 14th National People s Congress. To be clear the annual gathering of the top leadership is typically ceremonial in nature. The real power lies with the ruling Communist Party which is headed by Xi who is general secretary of the party and president of China. Still announcements made during the Congress can shed some light on government policy. Here are some highlights of what was announced at this year s weeklong parliamentary meeting which started Tuesday last week and ended Monday.  Along with the extensive discussions on environmental protection the Government Work Report GWR explicitly pledged to lower energy consumption per unit of GDP by around 2.5 in 2024 Citi analysts pointed out in a report Sunday. The report didn t set such numeric targets in 202223 after the 3.0 target and campaignstyle execution led to the power outages in 2021 the analysts said. But they warned that investors need to be mindful of the growth risks arising again from potential environmental policy tightening.  China has set a 2024 growth target of around 5 Premier Li Qiang at the start of the meetings on Tuesday when he released the muchanticipated government work report. Industrial support clearly ranked first on Beijing s priority list for the year ahead according to three major plans released as part of the parliamentary meetings. The top economic planner also noted how a push to upgrade equipment would generate a market of more than 5 trillion yuan about 694.5 billion. However the Minister of Housing and UrbanRural Development said property developers that must go bankrupt should go bankrupt. In a press conference on Saturday Ni Hong warned that those who harm the interests of the masses will be probed and punished. The Chinese Communist Party has increased its oversight of the government under Xi. At the 2023 parliamentary meeting Beijing announced an overhaul of finance and tech regulation by establishing partyled commissions to oversee the two sectors. Xi also gained an unprecedented third term as president at last year s meeting. This year the National People s Congress rubber stamped changes to revise the structure of the State Council which has been the government s top executive body led by the premier. At the ceremonial closing on Monday the amended State Council Organic Law passed with 2883 delegate votes with eight rejecting the amendments and nine abstentions. The changes include vice premiers and the head of the People s Bank of China among the council s top leadership group. It was not immediately clear what impact such changes would have.

AP PhotoAndy Wong BEIJING AP China s Premier Li Qiang promoted an image of confidence as he announced modest economic growth goals for the world s second largest economy at one of the country s most important political gatherings. Li addressed a few thousand delegates of the country s rubberstamp legislature the National People s Congress which met in Beijing. It s a time when the government reviews the work of the past year and crucially reveals targets and goals for the coming year especially in its approach to its economy military budget and Chinese society.  Chinese leaders and delegates attend the opening session of the Chinese People s Political Consultative Conference in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing Monday March 4 2024. AP PhotoTatan Syuflana Here are some key takeaways from Li s address Tuesday.  The government s overall approach to the economy will not change as the goals by the government for 2024 signal that they want to stabilize growth. Li announced that the GDP growth target was 5 this year a modest target that is still going to be difficult. China is grappling with an economic slowdown and a real estate market in crisis after a crackdown on excess borrowing led to a liquidity crisis among developers.  This year s targets are virtually the same as last year reflecting policy stasis in Beijing as the central leadership delays any significant economic policy decisions until the Third Plenum later in the year said Neil Thomas a fellow on Chinese Politics at the Asia Society.   Philippine and Chinese vessels collide in disputed South China Sea and 4 Filipino crew are injured China sets an economic growth target of around 5 but acknowledges it will not be easy to achieve China in a surprise announcement says it is eliminating an annual news conference by the premier TOUGHER LANGUAGE ON TAIWANLi s report had stronger language on Taiwan a selfruled island that China considers its own.  Missing from this year s report was the word peace. Last year the premier had called for advancing the process of China s peaceful reunification. This year Li said they will be firm in advancing the cause of China s reunification.  Overall the language this year was tougher said Arthur ZhinSheng Wang a professor at Taiwan s Central Police University who s an expert on crossStraits relations. Dropping the word peace combined with the phrase resolutely opposing Taiwan independence is what signals a stronger stance Wang said. Last year the work report had more language about promoting the prosperity of both sides as well while this year only had a brief nod.

AP PhotoNg Han Guan Taiwan held presidential elections in January and elected Lai Chingte to be its next president giving the Democratic Progressive Party a third term. The party s platform maintains that Taiwan is already independent of China.  Taiwan and China have been ruled separately since 1949 when the Nationalist government of Chiang Kaishek retreated to the island after losing a civil war on the mainland to Mao Zedong s communist forces. The government announced an increase of 7.2 in the military budget the world s secondhighest behind the United States at 1.6 trillion yuan 222 billion. China s defense budget has more than doubled since 2015 but in recent years it has dialed down the increase in defense spending as economic growth slowed.   China demands the US stop any official contact with Taiwan following a congressional visit Philippines urges neighbors to stand together more strongly against China in the South China Sea MIGRANT WORKERSChina s rural and urban populations have long been divided by the hukou a registration and identification system through which social benefits are allocated such as health insurance and schools. Cities and urban areas generally have better social benefits than rural ones. For the first time in recent years the government s work report mentioned that it would want to make it easier for migrant workers with rural hukou registrations to be able to change their hukous to urban ones. While hukou reform has long been discussed the mention in the government report signals that it could be higher on the agenda of the central authorities.

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/live-blog/china-national-peoples-congress-2024-live-updates-rcna141638, The Chinese government plans to increase its defense budget 7.2 according to a draft budget report submitted to the legislature Tuesday. It is the same rate of increase as last year and the ninth consecutive year of singledigit increases in defense spending.  The U.S. and other countries in the AsiaPacific region keep a close eye on Chinas defense spending and military development amid tensions over the status of Taiwan and Chinas growing aggression in the South China Sea a strategic waterway that Beijing claims virtually in its entirety. Heading into this NPC there has been a lot of speculation about China s next foreign minister. The country has been without one since Qin Gang was abruptly fired last year setting off a wave of rumors about a man once regarded as part of Xi s inner circle. Currently Wang Yi holds down the position in addition to his job as the country s chief diplomat. Judging by comments officials made yesterday it is unlikely that a new foreign minister will be announced by the end of this year s session or any time in the near future it seems.  The frontrunner is still widely believed to be Liu Jianchao who started his career as a translator in 1987 and has worked his way up through the foreign ministry ranks including as China s ambassador to Indonesia and the Philippines. Already Liu has been doing some diplomatic globetrotting even if he hasn t been anointed yet. Qin s resignation as a delegate to this year s National People s Congress was accepted last week though he has not been seen in public since June. Wang will conduct the traditional foreign minister s news conference this week. As China struggles with high unemployment and other economic issues jobrelated proposals at this years legislative sessions are drawing special attention on Chinese social media. One delegate to the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference a top advisory body is urging officials to address the perception that companies are reluctant to hire people 35 and older a phenomenon referred to in China as the curse of 35. A topic about the delegates proposal has garnered more than 63 million views on Weibo a popular Chinese social media platform.  Another topic touching on the intense competition for jobs among university graduates drew more than 22 million views.  The country s record low birthrate also propelled several proposals about increasing parental support and easing pressure for families with children but it met with tepid reaction on social media with one comment reading It s a bit late now. Another user wrote The future is uncertain I don t want to pressure myself so much.  Regarding the politically sensitive issues of Taiwan and Hong Kong Li did not signal much of a shift in China s policy. Li said the Chinese territory of Hong Kong will remain committed to lawbased governance administered by patriots in other words officials loyal to Beijing.  On Taiwan a selfruling island democracy that Beijing claims as its territory Li repeated China s official stance on reunification it will happen separatist activities China is opposed and external interference that s a standard reference to U.S. support for Taiwan including arms sales. It was at the 2020 meeting of the National People s Congress that China announced the sweeping Hong Kong national security law with no warning. The law was adopted within a month to end democratic protests in the city a former British colony that returned to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. The subsequent crackdown on dissent has all but wiped out Hong Kong s democratic opposition and prompted some foreign companies to shift away from the international financial hub. Hong Kong is now preparing to enact its own local national security law known as Article 23 as required under the city s miniconstitution. Critics say the legislation is likely to further undermine Hong Kong s civil liberties which it was guaranteed would be preserved for the first 50 years of Chinese rule. Delegates are filing out of the auditorium after Li finished delivering the government work report a bit more than an hour after he began speaking. Li also talked about keeping China s advantage when it comes to electric vehicles. In recent years Chinesemade EVs have powered ahead of U.S. and other foreign competitors here with help from heavy government subsidies and now companies like BYD are going global.  The rapid growth and production of Chinese EVs poses a worry for U.S. regulators however. The Commerce Department recently announced an investigation into the software that powers Chinesemade electric vehicles over concerns that China could collect data on U.S. motorists. Li says China will launch a yearlong program to increase consumption. Boosting domestic demand is crucial for Chinas effort to shift its economy away from the real estate sector which is mired in crisis and makes up a third or more of GDP. Li said Chinas economy was on an upward trajectory with its 5.2 growth rate one of the highest among the worlds major economies. But he also said the government was keenly aware of the difficulties and challenges we face. Chinese Premier Li Qiang at the opening session of the National People s Congress in Beijing.Florence Lo ReutersThe complexity severity and uncertainty of the external environment are increasing he said. The foundation for the sustained and positive recovery of the countrys economy is not yet solid with insufficient effective demand and weak social expectations. We must face these problems and challenges directly he said. China is aiming for economic growth of about 5 in 2024 Li said while delivering the governments annual work report. That is about the same as the 5.2 gross domestic product growth China reported last year. One thing observers around the world will be watching is what measures the Chinese government will announce to support the economy which is experiencing a slowdown. Foreign investors and others have called for fiscal stimulus to boost an economy weighed down by a real estate crisis high unemployment deflation sluggish consumption and a decline in exports and foreign investment amid geopolitical tensions. Chinese President Xi Jinping second from right at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing on Monday.Lintao Zhang Getty ImagesXi led top Chinese officials on stage at the Great Hall of the People kicking off the opening session of the National Peoples Congress. Li Chinas No. 2 official is now delivering the governments work report his first since becoming premier last year. It is expected to include the economic growth target for 2024 among other things.  One thing Beijing residents can usually count on during the Two Sessions is clear skies social media users even have a term for it liang hui blue. Its often been speculated that Chinese officials go to great lengths to ensure the best possible weather including by ordering factories outside Beijing to shut down before and during the political event. This year however weather conditions may have been too unfavorable to influence The city woke up this morning to freezing temperatures gray skies and wet snow.  The Great Hall of the People sits at the western edge of Tiananmen Square where security is always tight. During big political sessions like the National People s Congress it goes into overdrive with thousands of police officers soldiers and specialized security like canine units. Typically the square is searched and scoured before anyone is allowed to enter it including a thorough sniffing of the flower beds. On the eve of the opening of the National Peoples Congress Chinese officials made a surprise announcement Premier Li Qiang Chinas No. 2 official after Xi will not hold a news conference at the end of this years legislative session or at any of them during his term which runs until 2028. It marks the end of a 30year tradition. For decades the premiers televised news conference was one of the few chances for anyone including journalists like me who are based here to see the countrys No. 2 official providing insight into Chinese Communist Party thinking and publicly discussing Chinas affairs. Scrapping it is another reversal of the reforms and the opening up that began here in the late 1970s and it makes an opaque political system even more of a black box. It will be harder for foreign policymakers and businesses to get clear signals from Chinas leadership about plans. It is also likely to frustrate investors that at a time when Chinas economy is losing steam the countrys top economic official wont be talking about it. I have covered Chinese political events and meetings inside the Great Hall of the People since Xi first came to power in 2012. I admit to me being inside the building always feels a bit like being on a massive 1.85 millionsquarefoot movie set. The Great Hall of the People in Beijing.Jade Gao AFP Getty ImagesThe Great Hall of the People opened in September 1959 and in many ways the decor hasnt really changed. There are towering marble pillars thick red carpets and curtained hallways as well as sprawling paintings of Chinese scenery. Security protocols have certainly evolved over the years with facial recognition machines that read your ID card and airportstyle scanners in the lobby.  The focal point is the cavernous Auditorium of Ten Thousand People. Its where decades of Communist Party pomp and pageantry have played out under a huge red star on the ceiling adorned with lights. Up to 500 of the highestranking party members can sit on the raised dais. During big political events everything inside the auditorium is tightly choreographed including the way tea is served to officials. There is a maze of other reception halls and conference rooms. For all your big dinner needs the State Banquet Hall can host 5000 people as it did during Richard Nixons historic 1972 visit to China. The most prominent political event of the year in China is known as liang hui or the Two Sessions. The annual meetings of the ruling Chinese Communist Party are typically held in March except in 2020 when they were delayed until May by the pandemic at the Great Hall of the People near Tiananmen Square. The main event is the National People s Congress where the Chinese premier delivers a speech called the work report that lays out the government s plans and agenda for the year. There is also a consultative session the day before though decisions have been largely predetermined. Chinese President Xi Jinping chairs both sessions but does not give an address at either of them. About 3000 delegates come to Beijing from across China many of them attend the sessions wearing traditional dress or military uniforms. This year s NPC is likely to wind down on March 11 with internal votes on reports and a closing ceremony.,

Econographics ByHung Tran At the opening of China s fourteenth National People s Congress NPC on March 5th 2024 Premier Li Quang delivered his first Government Work Report setting the key economic and social policies and targets for this year. The NPC meeting will be followed by that of the National Committee of the Chinese People s Political Consultative Conference. Together those meetings constitute the Two Sessions an important annual event where political and policy decisions made earlier by the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party CCP are formally endorsed and publicly announced. The 2024 Government Work Report sets this year s economic targets which are virtually identical to those made in 2023. GDP growth is planned to be around 5 percent with a central government budget deficit of 3 percent of GDP in continuation of a proactive fiscal policy and a prudent monetary policy. In particular China plans to issue one trillion yuan of ultralong special government bonds to support the budget and to raise the special local government bond quota to 3.9 trillion yuan from 3.8 trillion yuan in 2023. The urban unemployment rate is set at around 5.5 percent with twelve million new jobs to be created. More interesting than the targets are the government s priorities as reflected in the increases in spending. Total central government expenditure is projected to increase by 3.8 percent to 28.5 trillion yuan almost 4 trillion with debt interest payments topping the list rising by 11.9 percent followed by science and technology at 10 percent stockpiling of grains edible oils and other necessities at 8.1 percent national defense at 7.2 percent same as last year diplomatic activities at 6.6 percent and education at 5 percent. The planned fiscal deficit at 3 percent of GDP declining from the realized deficit of 3.8 percent in 2023 along side the commitment to prudent monetary policy have disappointed many analysts and financial market participants who had hoped for a big bazooka stimulus plan to kick start the lackluster economy. Furthermore they point out that this year will not benefit from the base effect resulting from earlier slow growth due to Covid19. As a consequence most analysts are keeping their estimates for 2024 growth below 5 percent with the IMF expecting 4.6 percent. The key factor in this year s growth prospects is whether the property sector starts to stabilize having been in a sharp decline over the past three years. In particular after suffering the worst price fall in nine years a drop in investment of 9.6 percent and in new construction starts of 20.4 percent in 2023 home sales and prices have increased modestly in recent months. If this trend gains traction it would set the stage for the series of moderate support measures implemented so far to show some positive results. In this context it is interesting to note that Rhodium Group which had estimated actual 2023 growth to be 1.5 percent instead of the official 5.2 percent has expected a cyclical recovery to 3.5 percent in 2024. In any event more important than the exact GDP growth estimates is the NPC s endorsement of the decisions made earlier by the CCP Politburo. These decisions reflect Xi Jinping s emphasis on developing new quality productive forces through strengthening capability in science and technology to form the foundation for highquality growth. This has emerged as Xi s main strategy to develop a new engine of growth for China. It is also a way to stay competitive with the West in science and technology not the least to sustain the modernization of the Chinese military. New quality productive forces refer to new clean energy technologies and products dubbed the New Three by the Energy Intelligence Group. These include electric vehicles EVs lithium ion batteries and renewable energy products such as solar panels wind turbines storage facilities and other infrastructures all together accounting for 11 percent of China s GDP. These sectors were targeted in the 2015 Made in China plan as well as the 14th Five Year Plan adopted in 2021. Last year with state guidance and support the New Three sectors have experienced a surge in investment of 6.3 trillion yuan 890 billion 40 percent higher yearonyear. According to Finland s Center for Research on Energy and Clean Air CREA without that investment China s growth in 2023 might have been 3 percent instead of 5.2 percent. The Energy Intelligence Group has estimated that the new clean energy sectors will continue to grow accounting for 18 percent of China s GDP by 2027 in contrast to the property sector shrinking to a smaller but more sustainable 15 percent from its former peak of 25 percent of GDP. The problem with this approach is that it has created substantial overcapacity in those sectors leading to a surge in export at low prices to Europe the United States and the rest of the world. For example China accounts for 75 to 96 percent of the global production of various components of solar panels but demands only 36.4 percent of the output. The rest has to be exported. And China s export of EVs has increased by 1500 percent in the past three years helping China replace Japan as the largest exporter of automobiles. All together exports of New Three products increased by almost 30 percent in 2023 exceeding one trillion yuan 139 billion for the first time. Alarmed at the prospects of their markets being swamped with Chinese green energy products enjoying state support the EU has started an antidumping investigation into EV imports with a possibility of imposing countervailing duties. The United States has opened an investigation into the data security risks of Chinese vehicles using connected car technology . China has reacted strongly to such moves threatening retaliation. And China will try to export those products to countries in the Global South many of which having no domestic manufacturing and would welcome competitively priced goods for their climate transition efforts. In short one of the biggest implications of the Government Work Report is that the development of clean energy industries has been identified as a strategic focus to promote highquality growth a new Xi catchword. The chosen strategy serves China s strategic and economic interests but has created serious overcapacity problems distorting world markets and raising trade tensions with the West. This adds another dimension to the geopolitical rivalry between China and the United States making it more intractable and difficult to diffuse.

https://freedomhouse.org/country/china/freedom-world/2024, The numerical scores and status listed above do not reflect conditions in Hong Kong or Tibet which are examined in separate reports. Freedom in the World reports assess the level of political rights and civil liberties in a given geographical area regardless of whether they are affected by the state nonstate actors or foreign powers. Territories are sometimes assessed separately if they meet certain criteria including boundaries that are sufficiently stable to allow yearonyear comparisons. For more information see the report methodology and FAQ. China s authoritarian regime has become increasingly repressive in recent years. The ruling Chinese Communist Party CCP maintains tight control over all aspects of life and governance including the state bureaucracy the media online speech religious practice universities businesses and civil society. CCP general secretary Xi Jinping has consolidated personal power to a degree not seen in China for decades. Following a multiyear crackdown on political dissent independent nongovernmental organizations NGOs and human rights defenders China s civil society has been largely decimated. There are no direct or competitive elections for national executive leaders. The National People s Congress NPC formally elects the state president for fiveyear terms. The premier is nominated by the state president and confirmed by the NPC. In practice both positions are determined in advance by the top CCP leadership and announced at the relevant party congress. The CCP s sevenmember Politburo Standing Committee PSC headed by the party s general secretary sets government and party policy.  Xi Jinping was appointed for a third fiveyear term as general secretary at the 20th Party Congress in 2022 paving the way for him to remain in power indefinitely. This marked a sharp break from the post Cultural Revolution practice of maintaining a twoterm limit for the country s highest leadership position. In March 2023 General Secretary Xi secured a third term as state president with a unanimous NPC vote. Xi also serves as chairman of the state and party military commissions. Li Qiang a close ally of Xi was named premier in March 2023. The NPC has a maximum of 3000 members. They are formally elected for fiveyear terms by subnational congresses but the CCP vets all candidates in practice. Only the NPC s standing committee meets regularly with the full congress convening for just two weeks a year to approve proposed legislation party organs and the State Council or cabinet effectively control lawmaking decisions. The most recent NPC with 2977 members was seated in March 2023. Political positions are directly elected only at the lowest levels. Independent candidates who obtain the signatures of 10 supporters are by law allowed to run for seats in the countylevel people s congresses and elections for village committees are also supposed to give residents the chance to choose their representatives. In practice however independent candidates for these posts are often kept off the ballot or out of office through intimidation harassment fraud and sometimes detention.  Elections are not administered by an independent body. The indirect elections that populate people s congresses at various levels are conducted by those congresses standing committees while villagelevel elections are conducted by a village electoral committee that answers to the local party committee. The CCP effectively monopolizes all political activity and does not permit meaningful political competition. Eight small noncommunist parties are represented in the Chinese People s Political Consultative Conference an official advisory body but their activities are tightly circumscribed and they must accept the CCP s leadership as a condition for their existence. Citizens who have sought to establish genuinely independent political parties or prodemocracy movements are nearly all in prison under house arrest or in exile. The authorities continue to hold prodemocracy activists and lawyers in various forms of detention and prison. In April 2023 New Citizens Movement NCM founder and legal activist Xu Zhiyong who was detained in 2020 received a 14year prison sentence on charges of state subversion. Ding Jiaxi another figure within the NCM received a 12year sentence. China s oneparty system provides no institutional mechanism for organized political opposition. The CCP has ruled without interruption since winning a civil war against the Nationalist Party Kuomintang in 1949. Informal factions sometimes based on personal connections are known to exist within the CCP but their functioning is opaque. Xi has steadily increased his personal power and authority within the party since 2012 notably by purging rivals and challengers as part of an anticorruption campaign. The CCP is not accountable to voters and denies the public any meaningful participation in political affairs. The party uses a broad array of coercive tools and methods to suppress independent political engagement. The political system is dominated in practice by ethnic Han Chinese men. Women ethnic and religious minorities and LGBT people have no opportunity to gain meaningful political representation.  Nominal representatives of ethnic minority groups such as Tibetans Uyghurs and Mongolians hold administrative offices and participate in party and state bodies like the NPC but their role is largely symbolic. Women are severely underrepresented in top party and government positions. No women were named to the Politburo in 2022 marking the first time in 25 years that no women were included. Shen Yiqin who observers regarded as a likely addition to the Politburo joined the State Council in March 2023. No woman has ever sat on the PSC. None of China s national leaders are freely elected and the legislature plays a rubberstamp role in policymaking and the development of new laws. The concentration of power in Xi s hands a cult of personality centered on Xi and his regular calls for greater ideological conformity and party supremacy have further reduced the limited space for policy debate even within the CCP. Since becoming CCP leader in 2012 Xi has pursued an extensive anticorruption campaign. Well over a million officials have been investigated and punished according to official figures including senior state party and military officials. Anticorruption functions are currently managed by the National Supervisory Commission which was established through a 2018 merger of existing state and party entities and is tasked with enforcing political and ideological discipline in addition to compliance with the law. Recent anticorruption efforts originally focused on law enforcement agencies but have extended to various other government entities. Nevertheless corruption remains rooted in the oneparty system which does not tolerate the institutions necessary for effectively addressing graft such as a free press independent civil society groups and impartial courts.  In October 2023 Defense Minister Li Shangfu was dismissed without explanation with observers believing he was the subject of a corruption probe or a purge. Top officers within the People s Liberation Army PLA Rocket Force were also removed during the year after facing probes. The Chinese government and the CCP are notoriously opaque. Regulations on open government do not effectively compel local party and state organs to share critical data or respond to citizen requests. Under Xi s leadership the government has developed increasingly sophisticated methods for controlling the diffusion of information and shaping public discourse. The government has increasingly stopped publishing economic statistics in recent years. In August 2023 for example it stopped publishing youthunemployment data citing methodology concerns. A June report showed high unemployment for 16to24yearold urban residents. Beijing did not resume sharing that data by year s end. Beijing did not transparently disclose cabinet dismissals in 2023. Qin Gang was removed as foreign minister in July but was out of public view a month before. The government did not publicly explain his ouster though officials were reportedly told that Qin was fired over lifestyle issues a euphemism for sexual misconduct. Li Shangfu was out of public view two months before he was removed as defense minister. Chinese authorities have aggressively pursued policies to deliberately alter the demographics of ethnic minority regions particularly in Xinjiang Tibet and Inner Mongolia. Authorities in Xinjiang have interned more than a million Uyghurs and other members of Turkic ethnic minority groups in prisons other forms of detention and in socalled Vocational Skills Education and Training Centers VSETCs though some VSETCs have reportedly closed in recent years. According to Beijing VSETCs are educational centers Uyghurs and others voluntarily enter them and VSETCs curb terrorist and extremist activity. However a cache of internal government documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists ICIJ and published in 2022 provided evidence of their coercive and abusive nature. The documents which date back to 2017 describe facilities secured by armed guards who have been issued shoottokill orders against anyone attempting to escape. Detainees are subjected to aggressive forms of indoctrination and political reeducation that aim to undermine their ethnic identities and religious beliefs. Uyghur and other Muslim women in Xinjiang particularly those with two or more children are subject to a forcedsterilization program. Previous investigations and witness testimony have revealed that Xinjiang authorities have coerced women to accept surgical sterilization forcibly implanted intrauterine contraceptive devices prior to internment administered unknown drugs and injections to women in detention and used fines and internment as punishment for birthcontrol violations. Beijing also employs socalled poverty alleviation measures hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other ethnic minority members mostly farmers and other residents authorities refer to as surplus rural laborers are coerced into taking lowwage jobs away from their hometowns largely in stateowned factories. Participants described prisonlike environments where individuals are subjected to political indoctrination. In a 2022 report a UN special rapporteur cited evidence that the programs involve forced labor heavy surveillance violence and degrading treatment and that some instances may amount to enslavement as a crime against humanity.  Increasing numbers of ethnic minority children in Xinjiang and Tibet have been separated from their parents and forced to attend staterun boarding schools where Mandarin is the sole language of instruction and where students are subject to intense political indoctrination. Those who protest are subject to detention and other forms of punishment. In recent years the Ministry of Education has required preschools across China to make Mandarin the language of instruction reflecting an ongoing push to impose Mandarin as the dominant language at all educational levels and further weaken the cultural identities of ethnic minority groups and individuals. A multiyear campaign of detaining and imposing long prison terms on ethnic minority writers scholars musicians and religious figures continues to damage the cultural religious social and economic leadership of these communities. China is home to one of the world s most restrictive media environments and its most sophisticated system of censorship particularly online. The CCP maintains control over news reporting via direct ownership accreditation of journalists harsh penalties for comments that are critical of party leaders or the CCP and daily directives to media outlets and websites that guide coverage of breaking news stories. State management of the telecommunications infrastructure enables website blocks removal of smartphone applications from the domestic market and mass deletion of social media posts and user accounts that address banned topics. Thousands of websites have been blocked many for years including major news and social media hubs like the New York Times the British Broadcasting Corporation BBC YouTube X and Facebook. Rules and regulations governing the media and internet usage include measures that restrict news dissemination and contribute to the banning of mobile apps focused on minority languages Bible content and foreignlanguage learning among other topics. Censors have also removed large numbers of social media groups accounts or posts that dealt with LGBT issues financial advice critical views of CCP history and celebrities. The country s network of proCCP volunteer internet commentators and paid employees respectively standing at 20 million and 2 million as of 2021 aggressively monitors and censors online communications.  According to the Committee to Protect Journalists CPJ 44 journalists were imprisoned in China as of December 2023 though the number of people held for uncovering or sharing newsworthy information is far greater. Numerous citizen journalists and bloggers have been detained disappeared or criminally charged in recent years. Ruan Xiaohuan a dissident blogger who was arrested in 2021 received a sevenyear prison term for state subversion in February 2023. In April Fang Bin a citizen journalist who was detained for sharing information about the COVID19 outbreak in Wuhan in early 2020 was released. A relative said Fang had been charged with picking quarrels and provoking trouble a charge authorities commonly use to restrict offline and online expression. The partystate operates a multifaceted apparatus to control all aspects of religious activity including by vetting religious leaders for political reliability placing limits on the number of religious authorities such as priests and imams requiring ideological conformity within religious doctrine and installing security cameras inside religious establishments. The state recognizes Buddhism Catholicism Islam Protestant Christianity and Taoism. All religious groups must go through a rigorous process of certification to be officially recognized those that refuse are labeled illegal and persecuted. Thousands of Buddhist Taoist and folkreligion temples and house churches across China were completely or partially demolished by authorities in recent years.  Certain religions and religious groups including Tibetan Buddhists Uyghur Muslims Falun Gong practitioners and Christian house churches are persecuted harshly. In Xinjiang peaceful religious practices are routinely punished under charges of religious extremism resulting in detention prison sentences and indoctrination for many Uyghur Kazakh and Hui Muslims. Authorities have also used digital surveillance to suppress the religious activities of Uyghur and Turkic Muslims police have been known to interrogate residents who keep text from the Quran in their smartphones storage. A new law regulating religious venues which came into force in September 2023 reinforced state control over the organizational structure and personnel of religious groups. Under the measures religious groups must maintain files on staff activities including contact with foreign entities. Academic freedom is heavily restricted. Efforts to police classroom discussions are present at all levels of education including via installation of surveillance cameras in some classrooms largescale recruitment of student informants and the creation of special departments to supervise the political thinking of teaching staff. The CCP controls the appointment of top university officials and CCP committees and party branches have significant formal authority over university administration. Many scholars selfcensor to protect their careers and personal safety.  Political indoctrination including the study of Xi Jinping Thought is a required component of the curriculum at all levels of education. A number of universities have removed references to freedom of thought from their charters replacing them with pledges of loyalty to the CCP. Professors and students face reprisal for expressing views that are deemed critical of the CCP s governance or Xi s leadership. In October 2023 the NPC s standing committee approved the Patriotic Education Law which mandates the teaching and dissemination of patriotic education in schools and other settings. The law will take effect in 2024. Citizens continue to be charged and sentenced to sometimes long prison terms for critical or satirical social media posts on a variety of subjects and criticism or perceived criticism of Xi or the CCP. In addition to criminal punishment internet users face account deletions job dismissals arbitrary detention and police interrogation over such posts. The government s vast ability to monitor citizens lives and communications inhibits online and offline conversations. Administrators of social media applications like WeChat closely monitor user discussions to ensure conformity with government content restrictions. Surveillance cameras now frequently augmented with facialrecognition software cover many urban areas and public transportation and these networks are expanding into rural regions. Devices used by police to quickly extract and scan data from smartphones initially deployed in Xinjiang have spread nationwide.  Police have access to the personal details of broad categories of individuals. China s Cybersecurity Law obliges companies to store Chinese users data within the country and submit to often intrusive security reviews. Telecommunications companies are required to obtain facial scans of new internet or mobile phone users as part of the realname registration process which is combined with mass surveillance tools to closely monitor all residents. Electronic surveillance is supplemented with offline monitoring by neighborhood party committees and public security volunteers who are visible during large events. The revised Counterespionage Law gained the NPC standing committee s approval in April 2023 and took effect in July. The revised law restricts the transmission of information related to national security which is not clearly defined it also allows authorities to inspect electronic equipment and data. After the law took effect the Ministry of State Security called on ordinary citizens to engage in counterespionage activity. There is an especially heavy police presence in ethnic minority regions particularly Xinjiang. The ability of Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minority groups in Xinjiang to express themselves freely even in private has been further undermined in recent years by a policy of having Chinese officials live in their homes to monitor and indoctrinate them. The constitution protects the right of citizens to demonstrate but in practice protesters seldom obtain approval and risk punishment for assembling without permission. Spontaneous demonstrations have provided some outlet for local grievances though they are frequently met with police violence and criminal prosecution. Solitary protests in which an individual holds a placard in public for example can be criminally punished. Armed police have been accused of opening fire during past protests particularly in Xinjiang. Retirees objecting to healthcare changes held several large protests in early 2023. In February for example several hundred retirees demonstrated in the cities of Dailan and Wuhan. Domestic and foreign NGOs lack meaningful autonomy. While hundreds of thousands of NGOs are formally registered many effectively operate as governmentsponsored entities and focus primarily on service delivery. Nearly all prominent NGOs that focused on policy advocacy including in previously less politically sensitive areas have been shuttered under government pressure in recent years. Engaging in NGO work unsanctioned by the state is risky and many NGO workers have been detained and jailed. Foreign NGOs are legally required to find a Chinese sponsor and register with the Ministry of Public Security MPS and police have the authority to search NGOs premises without a warrant seize property detain personnel and initiate criminal procedures. LGBT organizations have closed or have had their social media activity restricted. The Beijing LGBT Center announced in May 2023 that it was closing under official pressure. In August the WeChat accounts of several LGBT groups were shut down. The only legal labor union organization is the governmentcontrolled AllChina Federation of Trade Unions which has long been criticized for failing to defend workers rights. Efforts to organize independent trade unions are swiftly shut down by authorities and the activists involved face harsh penalties. Workers have nevertheless engaged in a number of largely spontaneous strikes assemblies or other forms of public action with at least one thousand being recorded in 2023. The CCP dominates the judicial system with courts at all levels supervised by party politicallegal committees that have influence over the appointment of judges court operations and verdicts and sentences. CCP oversight is evident in politically sensitive cases and most judges are CCP members. Judges are expected to conform to CCP ideology and uphold the principle of party supremacy over the judiciary. Many judges complain about local officials interfering in cases to protect powerful litigants support important industries or avoid their own potential liability. Violations of due process are widespread in practice. Trials of human rights activists religious dissidents and other human rights defenders are routinely held in secret with even family members being denied information or entry. While adjudication of routine civil and administrative disputes is considered more fair cases that touch on politically sensitive issues or the interests of powerful groups are subject to decisive guidance from party politicallegal committees. Legal counselors are ultimately meant to serve the state as opposed to the client. Clients do not benefit from an expectation of attorneyclient privilege. Prosecutions rely heavily on confessions many of which are obtained through torture despite laws prohibiting such practices. Forced confessions are often televised. An ongoing crackdown on human rights lawyers has left many defendants without effective or independent legal counsel. Extrajudicial forms of detention remain widespread. The practice of residential surveillance in a designated location allows the police to hold individuals in secret detention for up to six months and has been deployed against human rights defenders and lawyers and government critics. Conditions in places of detention are harsh with reports of inadequate food regular beatings and deprivation of medical care. In addition to their use to extract confessions torture and other forms of coercion are widely employed in efforts to force political and religious dissidents to recant their beliefs. Impunity is the norm for police brutality and suspicious deaths in custody. Citizens and lawyers who seek redress for such abuse are often met with reprisals or imprisonment. Peaceful protesters are regularly beaten by police or hired aggressors. Many political and religious dissidents have died in prison or shortly after release due to illtreatment or denial of medical care. In February 2023 Radio Free Asia reported that Geshe Phende Gyaltsen a Tibetan Buddhist monk died in custody in late January. Phende Gyaltsen s condition reportedly deteriorated after he was tortured. The government has gradually reduced the number of crimes that carry the death penalty but does not publish the number of executions it carries out. Despite the government s claim that it has ended the transplantation of organs from executed prisoners the scale and speed of the transplantation industry far exceed what is feasible via the voluntary donation system. In 2021 a group of UN human rights experts expressed alarm over ongoing reports of organs being procured from ethnic and religious minority groups. Chinese laws formally prohibit discrimination based on nationality ethnicity race gender religion or health condition but these protections are often violated in practice. Several laws bar gender discrimination in the workplace and some indicators of gender equality have reportedly improved over the past decade. Nevertheless bias remains endemic including in job recruitment and college admissions. Women s rights activists and individuals who campaign against sexual harassment and assault have themselves faced harassment detention and in some cases criminal prosecution. In September 2023 Sophia Huang Xueqin a prominent MeToo advocate was tried for state subversion along with labor rights campaigner Wang Jianbing. In December the trial against women s rights campaigner Li Qiaochu who received the same charge began in Shandong Province. Members of ethnic and religious minority groups LGBT people people with disabilities and people with illnesses such as HIV AIDS and hepatitis B face discrimination in employment and access to education. Members of religious and ethnic minorities are disproportionately targeted and abused by security forces and in the criminal justice system. In addition to being held in extrajudicial detention in larger numbers members of these groups tend to be sentenced to longer prison terms than Han Chinese convicts.  Despite China s international obligation to protect the rights of asylum seekers and refugees law enforcement agencies continue to repatriate North Korean defectors who face imprisonment or execution upon return. While China s constitution gives individuals the right to petition the government concerning a grievance or injustice in practice petitioners are routinely intercepted in their efforts to travel to government centers forcibly returned to their hometowns or extralegally detained. The hukou household registration prohibits 295 million internal migrants from enjoying full legal rights as residents in the cities where they work. However local governments have loosened their enforcement in recent years. The government of Zhejiang Province removed some hukou restrictions in July 2023. In August the MPS announced that it would lower barriers for obtaining registrations in some urban areas and encouraged local governments to abolish or relax some of their requirements. Police checkpoints throughout Xinjiang limit residents ability to travel or even leave their hometowns. Millions of people are affected by government restrictions on their access to foreign travel and passports with Uyghurs and Tibetans experiencing the greatest difficulty. Many overseas Chinese nationals who engage in politically sensitive activities abroad are prevented from returning to China while those who seek refuge abroad often face forced repatriation and arrest. The revised Counterespionage Law allows authorities to stop individuals from leaving China on national security grounds including foreigners. The law also allows authorities to impose bans on entry. The authorities dominate the economy through stateowned enterprises in key sectors such as banking and energy state ownership of land and political and regulatory control. Chinese citizens are legally permitted to establish and operate private businesses. However all enterprises are vulnerable to political interference arbitrary regulatory obstacles debilitating censorship negative media campaigns demands for bribes and other forms of corruption.  An ongoing government crackdown on private businesses particularly large technology and social media firms has ostensibly been aimed at curbing monopolistic practices uncontrolled growth and other economic ills but has also brought the private sector more firmly under CCP control. In March 2023 Alibaba a large online commerce company announced it would disband into six separate units apparently on regulators orders. Running a business continues to expose individuals to prosecution and long prison terms. Property rights protection remains weak. Urban land is owned by the state with only the buildings themselves in private hands. Rural land is collectively owned by villages. Farmers enjoy longterm lease rights to the land they work but they have been restricted in their ability to transfer sell or develop it. Low compensation and weak legal protections have facilitated land seizures by local officials who often evict residents and transfer the land rights to developers. Corruption is endemic in such projects and local governments rely on land development as a crucial source of revenue. Following regulatory changes in 2021 allowing couples to have up to three children out of concern over falling fertility rates the government in 2022 launched a new campaign instructing local family planning officials to limit the number of abortions including by discouraging abortions for nonmedical reasons. While ethnic minority couples were already permitted to have up to three children prior to 2021 ethnic Tibetans as well as Uyghurs and other Muslims in Xinjiang face abusive policies aimed at limiting their reproduction in practice.  Domestic violence continues to affect a large number of Chinese women though a State Council report released in August 2023 noted that domestic violence fell since the 2015 introduction of the AntiDomestic Violence Law. That law does not criminalize spousal rape. Chinese law defines marriage as the union between a man and a woman denying marriage rights to samesex couples. Muslims in Xinjiang face restrictions and penalties related to aspects of their appearance with religious connotations such as headscarves on women or beards on men. While workers in China are afforded important protections under existing laws violations of labor and employment regulations are widespread. Exploitative employment practices such as wage theft excessive overtime student labor and unsafe working conditions are pervasive in many industries. Forced labor and human trafficking are common affecting internal migrants as well as Chinese nationals who are trafficked abroad. Forced labor is the norm in prisons and other detention facilities.
