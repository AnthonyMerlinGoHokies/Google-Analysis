https://www.npr.org/2020/09/10/909380525/nypd-study-implicit-bias-training-changes-minds-not-necessarily-behavior, As U.S. law enforcement departments are accused of racist policing one of the most common responses by the people in charge has been to have officers take implicit bias training. The training usually consists of a seminar in the psychological theory that unconscious stereotypes can lead people to make dangerous snap judgments. For instance unconscious associations of African Americans with crime might make cops quicker to see them as suspects. After the 2014 Ferguson Mo. protests states rushed to require the training. Now a majority do with New Jersey joining the list late last month. We MUST address the systemic and implicit biases that too often impact relations between law enforcement and communities.Proud to sign legislation to mandate diversity and implicit bias training in every State county municipal law enforcement dept.httpst.cor95bedDvWC pic.twitter.comMtfqVHk9wD But despite the boom in implicit bias training there has been little reallife research into whether it actually changes what police officers do on the job. Its like Im offering you a pill to fix some disease and I havent tested to see whether it actually works says Joshua Correll an associate professor of psychology at the University of Colorado Boulder where he studies racial bias. Expecting that we can take people in and train them to reduce their implicit bias I dont think its been supported by the literature. Thats why Correll is excited about a new study at the New York Police Department that allowed researchers to track the effects of mandatory implicit bias training as it was implemented in 2018. Their findings? As measured in surveys before and after their training NYPD officers expressed more awareness of the concept of implicit bias and greater willingness to try to manage it. We could certainly say that the training can be credited with elevating officers comprehension of what implicit bias is says Robert E. Worden director of the John F. Finn Institute for Public Safety in Albany N.Y. and the lead author of the study. But then the researchers examined data about NYPD officers actions on the job before and after the training. Specifically they looked at a breakdown of the ethnic disparities among the people who were arrested and had other kinds of interactions with those officers. And in those numbers they found no meaningful change. Its fair to say that we could not detect effects of the training on officers enforcement behaviors says Worden. Worden calls it a null result It doesnt prove implicit bias training changes cops behavior but it doesnt disprove it either. We believe that our training reduces biased behavior on the streets of the jurisdictions where we train says Lorie Fridell the University of South Florida criminology professor who developed the Fair and Impartial Policing curriculum used in New York. That the research didnt detect those changes in behavioral outcomes does not mean that they did not occur. She points to the inherent difficulties in measuring reallife outcomes in policing especially in a place like New York. Multiple other variables may have clouded the data such as the citys preexisting efforts to reduce race as a factor in police stops. The NYPD brass also doesnt seem to be bothered by the lack of change in behaviors. That wasnt the objective says First Deputy Commissioner Benjamin B. Tucker. The training was designed just to have them do some selfreflection and just to understand that any biases that they may have may creep into their job he says. That awareness we think adds value in and of itself. Tucker says its worth the 5.5 million it cost to train the departments 36000 officers. Anecdotally police officers around the U.S. are getting used to the training and even warming to it. I think that even the most cynical cop out there would agree that prejudice on the street is a problem and youve got to try to do something says Adam Plantinga a San Francisco police sergeant who writes about policing. If we approach a suspect whos reaching for his pocket he says does that white suspect get a second or two more of a grace period than the suspect of color before we draw our gun? But from a purely utilitarian perspective do such moments of selfreflection as the NYPDs Tucker put it actually lead to fairer policing especially given the unresolved debate among researchers about how or even whether implicit bias governs behavior? Correll the psychology professor says the training itself probably doesnt hurt but theres an opportunity cost to consider especially if the effort to fix implicit bias in officers displaces other kinds of training or gives a city an excuse to ignore factors that are external to policing. You dont need to intervene at the level of the individual police officers brain Correll says. You need to intervene at the level of the culture such as grappling with the reasons certain communities have more encounters with the police such as poverty or public housing policies that end up concentrating particular ethnic groups in crimeprone areas. Even one of the pioneers of the theory of implicit bias Harvard University psychology professor Mahzarin Banaji worries about the quality of implicit bias training for police. The teaching of implicit bias concepts has been in the hands of people called diversity trainers and theyre like politicians they dont have to have any expertise Banaji says referring to the decentralized entrepreneurial reality of the world of police consultants and trainers. At the same time she says even the best implicit bias training shouldnt be expected to produce immediate changes in the behaviors of a whole police department. That to me is like saying Can I give you a lecture on climate change? and tomorrow youre going to stop driving your car and start taking public transportation she says. I dont think the question is commensurate with the behavior that theyre measuring. She believes there are still years of research ahead before we can say we know how to deal effectively with implicit bias. Others are trying to make progress on that. Following the NYPD study the next major attempt to test the effectiveness of implicit bias training on police is work being done by Lois James at Washington State University. Shes one of the developers of Counter Bias Training Simulation a curriculum that uses video scenarios in shooting simulators to show officers the dangers created by implicit bias. The hope is that a more handson experience will have a deeper impact but shes not assuming it works. As someone whos literally developed an implicit bias program I think it would be irresponsible for us to not test the outcome James says. It cant be just speculation. Shes in the middle of an experiment with the Sacramento Police Department in which some officers will get her simulatorbased training some will get traditional seminarstyle implicit bias training and some will get neither. Then her graduate students will review the body camera videos of officers interactions with the public before and after the training period and score them for how civilly the officers treat each ethnic group. James says she finds it disheartening that the NYPD study found no behavioral change and she says Many people are expecting me to find nothing too but well see. Even if her study also finds no behavioral change she says it doesnt mean we should eradicate implicit bias training. It just means we have to work harder. A previous version of this story incorrectly said that the training cost 5.5 million per year. The 5.5 million was to train officers over more than two years. Become an NPR sponsor

In a new podcast from OPB and ProPublica follow the fight to save them through the voices of one Yakama Nation family. This transcript was created by a computer and edited by a volunteer. Dave Miller This is Think Out Loud on OPB. I m Dave Miller. A new study by researchers at Washington State University found that implicit bias training for police officers had a small but significant positive effect. The study recruited 50 officers in Sacramento who participated in video simulations of encounters with various community members. Researchers found that officers who completed the training had fewer complaints of discrimination by community members than officers without that training. Lois James is the lead author of the study. She s an assistant dean of research and an associate professor in the College of Nursing at Washington State University. She joins us now. Welcome to the show. Lois James Hi. Thank you so much for having me. Miller Thanks for joining us. What do you mean when you say implicit bias specifically in the context of police officers? James That s such a great question. And honestly it s a concept that s often misunderstood or not really understood very well. And what we mean when we say implicit bias is unconscious bias the biases that lurk below the surface that we re not even necessarily aware of being there. And the reason that implicit bias can be so problematic is because of its subconscious nature it can influence us in ways that we don t intend or that we don t anticipate. And it can shape some of our decisions and unfortunately can lead to some discriminatory behavior. Miller How much of what we talk about in terms of policing in the US is implicit bias as opposed to explicit bias? James Explicit bias obviously is bias that we re aware of. Now that can manifest itself as bigotry as prejudice for example racism sexism some kind of bias that a person would put their hand up and claim That s who I am. That s what I think. And then you can also have covert explicit bias where somebody might be aware of it but they re ashamed of it or they don t you know they certainly wouldn t put their hand up and say Yes this is who I am. So really with policing it s hard to say because if you can imagine giving somebody a questionnaire unless they re really overtly explicitly biased in which case hopefully they re not working for a department anymore. They re not going to say You know I believe this group of people are worse because  So really what we re exploring is what are biases that are implicit and what are biases that are explicit but covert. So what we re trying to do is we re trying to shine a light on implicit bias for officers so they can actually bring them into conscious awareness so that they can recognize that Okay maybe I do think that. Maybe I do have this association. And if they re aware of it at least they have a chance of controlling it. Miller The implicit bias tests that I ve done and I have a feeling that many listeners at this point have done often it s how quickly can you see say a person who may be Black or white and words that are negative or positive and you do these in various iterations. And you re supposed to do it fast enough to be able to click on things and when you do that you find out that without realizing it your brain makes certain associations. That s I think a common online version just for the general public. But what does the training that you ve developed entail in its entirety? James The test you were talking about is the implicit association test out of Harvard. And it remains our best measure of implicit bias. What we do with the training is more behaviorally based. So with the training we have officers go through these scenarios these very realistic scenarios that are just based around fairly routine police community member interactions that often have the potential to be volatile. So things like interacting with people in crisis responding to domestic disturbances doing welfare checks investigations of suspicious persons or circumstances things like that. And the officers respond in this simulated setting. They respond to the scenario and then we have the ability to drive the scenario or dictate what the person onscreen does or says based on how the officer is behaving. So for example if an officer approaches somebody in a scenario introduces themself by name explains why they re there offers some kind of concern or empathy offers any kind of help to the person any kind of resources tries their best to deescalate. So if it does go volatile if an officer does all of those things we have the ability then to end the scenario in a very positive manner. However if that same officer were to let s say put their hand on their holster not be personable at all with the person not introduce themselves not explain why they re there just rapid fire questions and behave in a way that we re really trying to move away from the really authoritative not humanistic side of communication if they do that then we have the ability to send the scenario in a much more volatile negative way. So by going through these scenarios officers start to A practice the skills that we want them to practice and B start to uncover themselves OK do I respond differently based on the type of person that I m interacting with?  And what we re really trying to do with the training is to generate that selfawareness. As I said shining a light on implicit bias and making an officer aware of what their mental filter looks like that they see the world through. That s where the true learning occurs. Not just in the responses to the scenarios but in all of the great conversation afterwards both with their peers who are observing and then with the facilitators and the trainers as well. Miller You ve said that you ve seen small but significant decreases in disparities in terms of how officers treated different types of people. What do you see as the most important results from this study? James I do think that reduction and disparity piece is really important. It was encouraging and it was great to find that the officers in the intervention group had generally better performance scores after the training. And what I mean by that is regardless of who they were interacting with they tended to display more of the indicators of really good policing based in procedural justice based in deescalation based in all of the great things that we want our officers to be doing as they protect and serve community members. But the thing that was really encouraging is we looked at all of our baseline data because we looked at a year essentially not every single video of course but a random selection of body camera footage videos from the year before the training intervention to really see what the disparities in this city with this department look like. And the biggest one by far was how officers interacted when they were interacting with community members suffering homelessness versus when they were interacting with community members who were not suffering homelessness. Miller That was higher than the disparity between say Black residents and white residents? James Correct. So the homelessness piece was the biggest disparity that we saw and that s homelessness kind of controlling for the race of the person or the gender of the person or the size of the person. So you ve got body camera footage there are a lot of variables that you can control for because you re seeing this person. Now a small caveat there that is important is that oftentimes of course we did have to make judgments. So it s like appears to be suffering homelessness appears to be Black appears to be white appears to be male or female. Oftentimes these are assumptions that we re making. But we did a great deal of training with our research assistants to really make sure that they were as well trained as possible as they coded this footage. Miller And I imagine we re also talking about assumptions anyway on the part of officers. So hopefully there might be some convergence there. My understanding is that it s not uncommon these days for police departments around the country to do some kind of implicit bias training. But a press release about your study said this is the first known research to provide evidence that this kind of training can actually produce positive effects. If that s the case why has this training become so common? James I should say ours is the first to produce positive behavioral effects. So in the past studies have certainly looked at whether an officer s knowledge around bias increases or improves. And do their attitudes or their intent to put into play the lessons that they learned during training does that improve? But this is the first study to kind of look at what officer behavior looks like before the intervention? And now what does it look like after the intervention? Miller That seems like the most important thing from the public s perspective. What are officers actually doing as opposed to what do they intend to do? What have they learned from a book? James Exactly. That s what the public cares about. And also honestly that s what departments care about too because training is intended to produce behavior change. Miller So how do you explain that? Why is it that these have become so common? If yours is the first study to show positive behavioral changes? James I think part of the answer to that is that it s often mandated. If a department is going through any kind of consent to care or collaborative reform then typically some kind of antibias training is going to be front and center especially if that s one of the reasons that they re being audited or observed closely anyway. And then I think another reason is that departments sometimes can be very proactive. They can have communication with their community leaders for example that can recommend it. So I think that oftentimes departments think that it s a good idea. We just haven t to this point had any really solid evidence that it could be a positive thing. And that s the concern that some people have had with implicit bias training. Is there any potential that it could be producing negative effects or damaging effects which thankfully was not observed in our study. But regardless I do think that additional research needs to occur because this was a fairly small study and it s one police department. Whether that s generalizable to all police departments is just something that we don t know. Miller I should also mention that tool that you studied is one that you helped develop. If it s seen as effective it could lead to more business for you. More police departments could buy it. How did you deal with that potential conflict of interest? James So we dealt with it in a number of ways. This study was actually funded by the National Institute of Justice which is a Department of Justice research branch. And because there was that potential conflict of interest we had to put several steps in place. And the big one that we put in place was that as our research assistants were coding data they were completely blinded to the group that they were coding. So in other words when they were reviewing a body camera footage video they did not know whether that officer was trained or not. So there was no potential for even any kind of subconscious I think that this officer might have been in the intervention group so I m going to lean towards scoring them more favorably. That just was completely removed from the equation. And that s the big one. And honestly that s very typical with randomized control trials with experimental designs that notion of blinding because it s possible that even subconsciously if people knew that they could score things slightly differently. So that was the big one. And then the other big one of course is that we were not actually doing the coding ourselves. Miller Lois James thanks very much for joining us. I appreciate having you on.

https://policeaccountability.org.au/issues-and-cases/racial-profiling/anti-racial-profiling-training/, There is a need for a comprehensive and integrated recruitment selection training and professional development regime within Victoria police aimed at reducing and preventing racially biased policing. We need to go beyond sensitivity training and cultural awareness raising sessions. Members of Victoria Police have demonstrated clearly explicit and direct racial bias in their interactions with some members of the Victorian community. Further recent studies indicate that the basis of discriminatory behaviour is not only the fault of illintentioned individual members of Victoria Police. Implicit bias means that wellmeaning and tolerant police officers even those with egalitarian views and opinions may also demonstrate racial bias in their interactions with members of the public. This section will focus on the prevalence and impact of implicit bias on the policing of ethnic minorities and training methodologies aimed at reducing its impact on modern operational policing. Victoria Police can take the steps necessary to ensure that it employs world class law enforcement training techniques to be most effective in reducing harm and maintaining a safe secure and orderly society 1 whilst upholding the human rights of all Victorians.2 1 Chief Commissioner Ken Lay Foreword Victoria Police Blueprint 201215 Victoria Police 2012. 2 Victoria Police Effective Police Service Delivery Victoria Police Blueprint 201215 Victoria Police 2012 Priority 2.  At the basic level law enforcement recruits should be challenged to identify key police decisions and scenarios that are at greatest risk of manifesting bias such as traffic stops consent searches reasonable suspicion to frisk and other proceduresand then reflect on the potential impact of implicit bias on their perceptions and behaviours in those scenarios.  Race gender age disability and sexual orientation all have the potential to impact and influence decisions. Further seasoned officers should be similarly challenged at inservice and other training venues.  Supervisors should be challenged to consider how implicit biases may manifest not only in themselves but also in their subordinates.  Connecticut Police Commissioner Tracey Gove Tracey G Gove Implicit Bias and Law Enforcement 2011 The Police Chief It is of critical importance that Victoria Police as an institution understands what constitutes racial bias and racial profiling how it is identified the nature of its features and how it can be trained against. Whilst some overt racists undoubtedly exist in Victoria Police as they do throughout society institutional racism encapsulates much more than that. It includes casual racism the unthinking application of racial stereotypes. But what has not been acknowledged that racial profiling does indeed exist in Victoria Police not as some formal policy but within and well beyond the police canteen based on gross misconceptions and stereotypes. Victoria Police needs to ensure that every single member of Victoria Police and those entering it completely understands what constitutes racial profiling. Victoria Police needs to articulate a clear definition and refutation of racial profiling as a legitimate police tactic along the lines of the Racial Profiling Policy of the Ottawa Police Service. Police training should be immediately audited and critically reviewed to ensure that With extensive input from community representatives Victoria Police should immediately introduce a comprehensive and integrated training program that aims to eliminate unconscious racialreligious biases antibias training.

In contrast to assumptions that such responses are fixed and inescapable it is shown that automatic stereotypes and prejudice are influenced by a self and social motives b specific strategies c the perceiver s focus of attention and d the configuration of stimulus cues. In addition group members individual characteristics are shown to influence the extent to which global stereotypes and prejudice are automatically activated. This evidence has significant implications for conceptions of automaticity models of stereotyping and prejudice and attitude representation. The review concludes with the description of an initial model of early social information processing. Please find document here. Introduction The delivery of policing whether in the form of force or service should not be greatly inferior for some social groups than others. And yet the research evidence shows that in general people who are seen as are white tend to have a more satisfactory experience of the police than people whose ancestry lies in Asia Africa and the islands of the sea . The socalled colourline that the pioneering sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois 19011989 13 predicted would be the problem of the twentieth century can be discerned clearly a hundred years later in the relationship between police and ethnic minority communities in numerous countries around the world. Furthermore recent shifts in migration patterns have demanded a reconceptualisation of the perception of those who might belong to ethnic minority groups and indeed it is the question of difference that has become salient in contemporary societies Hall 1991 2000. Such conceptual shifts have implications for the relationship between the police and citizens from minority ethnic communities. In this chapter we examine policing practices making comparisons between the policing of white black and Asian communities in Britain. We begin with a discussion of the history of policing minority ethnic communities and how they have been targeted for particular forms of policing. We look at both publicinitiated encounters with the police such as reporting crime and policeinitiated encounters such as stop and search and the decisions to arrest and charge. Having looked at the problems in policing and attempted to explain them we go on to look at some of the solutions including the recruitment of a more diverse police service and renewed accountability mechanisms. We consider the changes that have occurred between the Scarman Inquiry of 1981 and the Lawrence Inquiry of 1999 and we review some of the research that has assessed PostLawrence reforms. Through the discussion we also reflect on the 2001 and 2005 terrorist attacks in the US and UK and the implications they have had for contemporary policing. Finally we point to new directions in the development of research in this field Please find document here. Note This article follows on from Corell et al s research in The police officer s dilemma Using ethnicity to disambiguate potentially threatening individuals above. Please find document here. Abstract Police officers were compared with community members in terms of the speed and accuracy with which they made simulated decisions to shoot or not shoot Black and White targets. Both samples exhibited robust racial bias in response speed. Officers outperformed community members on a number of measures including overall speed and accuracy. Moreover although community respondents set the decision criterion lower for Black targets than for White targets indicating bias police officers did not. The authors suggest that training may not affect the speed with which stereotypeincongruent targets are processed but that it does affect the ultimate decision particularly the placement of the decision criterion. Findings from a study in which a college sample received training support this conclusion. Please find document here. Abstract Using a simple video game the effect of ethnicity on shootdon t shoot decisions was examined. African American or White targets holding guns or other objects appeared in complex backgrounds. Participants were told to shoot armed targets and to not shoot unarmed targets. In Study 1 White participants made the correct decision to shoot an armed target more quickly if the target was African American than if he was White but decided to not shoot an unarmed target more quickly if he was White. Study 2 used a shorter time window forcing this effect into error rates. Study 3 replicated Study 1 s effects and showed that the magnitude of bias varied with perceptions of the cultural stereotype and with levels of contact but not with personal racial prejudice. Study 4 revealed equivalent levels of bias among both African American and White participants in a community sample. Implications and potential underlying mechanisms are discussed Please find document here. Abstract Three studies tested basic assumptions derived from a theoretical model based on the dissociation of automatic and controlled processes involved in prejudice. Study I supported the model s assumption that high and lowprejudice persons are equally knowledgeable of the cultural stereotype. The model suggests that the stereotype is automatically activated in the presence of a member or some symbolic equivalent of the stereotyped group and that Iowprejudice responses require controlled inhibition of the automatically activated stereotype. Study 2 which examined the effects of automatic stereotype activation on the evaluation of ambiguous stereotyperelevant behaviors performed by a raceunspecified person suggested that when subjects ability to consciously monitor stereotype activation is precluded both high and lowprejudice subjects produce stereotypecongruent evaluations of ambiguous behaviors. Study 3 examined high and lowprejudice subjects responses in a consciously directed thoughtlisting task. Consistent with the model only lowprejudice subjects inhibited the automatically activated stereotypecongruent thoughts and replaced them with thoughts reflecting equality and negations of the stereotype. The relation between stereotypes and prejudice and implications for prejudice reduction are discussed. Abstract We developed a multifaceted prejudice habitbreaking intervention to produce longterm reductions in implicit race bias. The intervention is based on the premise that implicit bias is like a habit that can be broken through a combination of awareness of implicit bias concern about the effects of that bias and the application of strategies to reduce bias. In a 12week longitudinal study people who received the intervention showed dramatic reductions in implicit race bias. People who were concerned about discrimination or who reported using the strategies showed the greatest reductions. The intervention also led to increases in concern about discrimination and personal awareness of bias over the duration of the study. People in the control group showed none of the above effects. Our results raise the hope of reducing persistent and unintentional forms of discrimination that arise from implicit bias. Excerpt In contrast to oldfashioned racism which is open and blatant aversive racism represents a subtle often unintentional form of bias that is characteristic of many White Americans who possess strong egalitarian values and who believe that they are nonprejudiced Gaertner Dovidio 1986 Kovel 1970. The work on aversive racism primarily considers Whites attitudes towards Blacks although elsewhere we have demonstrated the generalizability of these processes to attitudes towards Latinos Dovidio Gaertner Anastasio Sanitioso 1992 and women Dovidio Gaertner 1983. We propose that understanding the nature of contemporary forms of bias such as aversive racism can inform the development of strategies and Interventions designed to reduce prejudice. Abstract In a modified 4 x 4 factorial design with race blackwhite of the harmdoer and race blackwhite of the victim as the major factors the phenomenon of differential social perception of intergroup violence was established. White subject s observing a videotape of purported ongoing interaction occurring in another room labelled an act ambiguous shove as more violent when it was performed by a black than when the same act was perpetrated by a white. That is the concept of violence was more accessible when viewing a black than when viewing a white committing the same act. Causal attributions were also found to be divergent. Situation attributions were preferred when the harm doer was white and person dispositional attributions were preferred in blackprotagonist conditions. The results are discussed in terms of perceptual threshold stereotypy and attributional biases. Please find document here. Abstract Using police officers and undergraduates as participants the authors investigated the influence of stereotypic associations on visual processing in 5 studies. Study 1 demonstrates that Black faces influence participants ability to spontaneously detect degraded images of crimerelevant objects. Conversely Studies 2 4 demonstrate that activating abstract concepts i.e. crime and basketball induces attentional biases toward Black male faces. Moreover these processing biases may be related to the degree to which a social group member is physically representative of the social group Studies 4 5. These studies taken together suggest that some associations between social groups and concepts are bidirectional and operate as visual tuning devices producing shifts in perception and attention of a sort likely to influence decision making and behavior.

Foreword In seeking to protect the rights of the majority the police at times infringe certain individual rights such as the right to privacy or to freedom of movement and association. However they are only permitted to do so if the infringement is rational proportionate and lawful. Yet the evidence shows that on the contrary some police forces are using their powers disproportionately suggesting they are stopping and searching individuals in a way that is discriminatory inefficient and a waste of public money. This is despite the evidence from both Staffordshire and Cleveland which proves that a reduction in the use of stop and search can go hand in hand with a reduction in the overall levels of crime. Staffordshire and Cleveland show that policing which respects human rights is more effective and actually makes us safer. The evidence in Stop and think suggests that some forces are exercising their powers not on the basis of intelligence or reasonable suspicion but on stereotypical assumptions which is not helping to make society safer. Black people are at least six times as likely to be stopped as white people Asian people around twice as likely. Such an approach to policing erodes trust and makes cooperation harder not just between police forces and the groups who are singled out but also among the wider public who are ill at ease with the idea of the state intruding unnecessarily into individuals private lives and their freedom to go about their business. This is why the Equality and Human Rights Commission wants to see an end to the disproportionate use of stop and search. We hope to work with the police to make progress through advice guidance encouragement and where necessary enforcement. Respecting human rights assists good policing and effective crime control and creates a safer society for us all. Please find document here. Executive Summary In March 2010 the Equality and Human Rights Commission published Stop and think which showed that the police in England and Wales conducted about a million stops and searches of members of the public every year the great majority under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 PACE and similar laws requiring officers to have reasonable grounds for suspicion . The power has always been controversial and when Stop and think was published Asian people were stopped and searched about twice as often as white people and black people about six times as often. Stop and think also identified geographical differences for example little race disproportionality in much of the north of England and relatively high levels in some southern forces. There were also wide ranges year on year between some neighbouring similar forces and also between comparable London boroughs. The report concluded that unless forces could convincingly evidence that their race inequalities were justified their practice would be unlawful and discriminatory. Following the report the Commission applied criteria including extent of disproportionality and trends to identify five forces for further inquiries. It found that their explanations were not firmly substantiated by evidence nor could they define how much of their force s disproportionality might stem from these factors. Overall the Commission concluded that where firm action had been taken to reduce race disproportionality andor overall usage of the power it had succeeded without prejudice to falling crime levels. Key steps taken to reduce disproportionality appeared to be targets for reduction and for reducing negative drug searches training in reasonable grounds for and proportionate use of the power steps to ensure intelligenceled practice rather than practice based on hunches or generalisations about groups micromonitoring to identify local or individual racially skewed patterns and challenging them and senior level commitment and leadership.

But the good news is that we can still learn to override our prejudices and embrace difference. Summary In the wake of Skip Gates arrest racial profiling is back in the news. But is racially biased policing always the result of racism? Lorie Fridell on why the equation isn t so simple and how police departments can erase unconscious bias. Please find article here. Excerpt While some of the bias in policing is caused by intentional discrimination against people of color there is a considerably body of research that points to another mechanism producing biased behavior. Social psychological research has shown that implicit or unconscious racial bias can impact what people perceive and do even in subjects who consciously hold nonprejudiced attitudes. This chapter summarizes the research conducted on police officers and nonpolice subjects to gauge their implicit association between Blacks and crime and it then discusses the law enforcement interventions implied by the findings. Agencies need to hire a diverse workforce composed of people who can police in a raceneutral fashion use training to promote employees controlled responses to override automatic associations facilitate unlearning of the Black person crime association in firearms simulations set forth policy outlining the appropriate use of race ethnicity for making law enforcement decisions train first line supervisors so they can detect and respond effectively to biased behavior on the part of their supervisees and implement a style of policing that promotes positive interactions between police and their diverse constituencies.

Excerpt Biased policing and the perceptions of it threaten the relationship between police agencies and the diverse communities that they serve. The Office of Community Oriented Policing Services the COPS Office has supported the development of resources to help law enforcement agencies to promote fair and impartial policing. As a continuation of these efforts the COPS Office has funded the University of South Florida USF and Circle Solutions Inc. Circle to develop two model curricula. The project Racially Biased Policing Training is being led by Dr. Lorie Fridell of USF and Anna Laszlo Circle s Director of Research Evaluation and Training and Technical Assistance Services.

The Police Executive Research Forum PERF shares their intolerance for racially biased policing and hopes Racially Biased Policing A Principled Response will enhance citizen and police efforts to detect and eradicate it. Addressing racially biased policing and the perceptions of its practice involve complex issues and challenges. PERF members and their colleagues need to effectively allocate their limited agency resources to address the problem. PERF with funding and guidance from the Department of Justice s Office of Community Oriented Policing Services has prepared this report to assist agencies in meeting this challenge. This report is meant to provide the first step in assisting progressive police professionals in partnership with citizens to seriously consider the issues and develop approaches tailored to their community s unique needs. It guides law enforcement professionals in their response to racially biased policing and equally important to the perceptions of its practice to strengthen citizen confidence in the police and improve services to all our communities.

Over the past decade the term biasbased policing has been coined and the subject has been the topic of much research and debate. It often paints the picture of illintentioned officers deliberately acting upon preconceived stereotypes and prejudices. What if perhaps there was another answer? In the spring of 2010 professor Jerry Kang from the UCLA School of Law presented to Connecticut judges prosecutors public defenders and police administrators on the topic of implicit or hidden bias. His talk shed light on what has become an increasingly popular subject in social science circles. In brief researchers contend that implicit biases are predilections held by all that operate largely outside of one s awareness. Although hidden these biases are both pervasive and powerful. Much research on the topic has focused on racial bias and has netted some intriguing results. Please find document here. Abstract Gumbhir offers conceptual theoretical and empirical innovations to help unravel and illuminate the forces that produce racial disparities in law enforcement. Gumbhir provides a theoretical framework for analyzing racial differences in police contacts as well as a conceptualization of racial profiling that emphasizes police procedures related to the War on Drugs specifically pretext stop practices. Drawing on a grounded statistical analysis of vehicle stop data from a Pacific Northwest community Gumbhir exposes racial disparities in terms of stops searches enforcement actions citations and arrests and other variables of interest. By studying patterns in the results Gumbhir concludes that the police disproportionately apply pretext stop tactics to minority drivers. Excerpt During the past 2 decades public agencies including law enforcement have become increasingly concerned about ensuring organizational integrity and accountability. During this same period concerns about racial profiling or biasbased policing threatened to undermine the integrity of law enforcement nationally. Although there have long been allegations of police targeting people of color aggressive crimecontrol strategies used by police in an effort to reduce crime during the last 2 decades have heightened perceptions that police may use pedestrian or traffic stops as a pretext for conducting disproportionate numbers of investigations of Black or Hispanic individuals. As a result of such perceptions addressing racial profiling has become vital to law enforcement s efforts to ensure and promote integrity. This publication identifies a number of promising strategies supported by the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services the COPS Office program titled Promote Cooperative Strategies to Reduce Racial Profiling PCSRRP that law enforcement can use to identify address and prevent concerns about racial profiling in their agencies.

Experimental psychology has provided substantial evidence that the human mind can operate in automatic uncontrollable fashion as well as without conscious awareness of its workings and the sources of influence on it.With methods available to measure implicit or less conscious aspects of social cognition especially groupspecific attitudes and stereotypes several aspects of the nature of implicit social cognition are now regarded as well established. Such results primarily include the pervasive and robust implicit favoritism for one s own groups and socially dominant groups the dissociation between implicit and explicit social cognition the ability of both to predict behavior the greater impact of the former on certain discriminatory behaviors and the sensitivity of seemingly implicit thoughts feelings and behaviors to change in response to situational features and experience. Legal scholarship and judicial opinions are beginning to consider how the law can and should adapt to such findings in particular how they call into question existing assumptions regarding the notion of intent and their relevance for antidiscrimination law.

Abstract Arizona Senate Bill 1070 requires lawenforcement officers to verify the citizenship of individuals they stop when they have a reasonable suspicion that someone may be unlawfully present in the United States. Critics of the law fear it will encourage racial profiling. Defenders of the law point out that the statute explicitly forbids most forms of racial profiling. By drawing on the lessons learned in the domain of antidiscrimination law we discuss how social psychological research can inform this debate and illuminate challenges associated with fair enforcement of the statute. We conclude that the Arizona law paired with a lack of comprehensive training and ineffective testing procedures for detecting discrimination will likely result in many Latinos being illegally targeted on the basis of their race. While certain actions such as effective training and oversight may help mitigate discrimination these safeguards are not likely to completely eliminate biased outcomes. Executive Summary The term ethnic profiling describes the use by law enforcement officers of race ethnicity religion or national origin rather than individual behavior as the basis for making decisions about who has been or may be involved in criminal activity. Ethnic profiling appears most frequently in police officers decisions about who to stop and ask for identity papers ID question search and sometimes arrest. Although ethnic profiling is widespread1 the practice has not been sufficiently studied. Ethnic profiling constitutes discrimination and thus breaches fundamental human rights norms but it has not been expressly outlawed by any European government. Profiling is also counterproductive. It misdirects law enforcement resources and alienates some of the very people whose cooperation is necessary for effective crime detection. Ethnic profiling may result from the intentional racism of individual police officers but is frequently the cumulative result of unconscious and unchecked ethnic stereotypes. It can also reflect institutional factors such as police deployment patterns that do not reflect overt racial animus but nonetheless have disparate impacts on minorities. Stop and search powers are a basic tool of policing and the primary point of contact with police for most people yet their impact and effectiveness are rarely examined. Over 18 months starting in January 2007 the Open Society Justice Initiative worked with police forces and civil society organizations in Bulgaria Hungary and Spain to monitor the use of police stops in a project supported by the European Commission s AGIS Programme titled Strategies for Effective Police Stop and Search project or STEPSS. The participating organizations and individuals not only had the foresight to recognize that they might have a problem with ethnic profiling but were also willing to tackle the issue directly and share their experiences. STEPSS shows that while it is not easy it is possible even in a short period of time to identify and begin to address patterns of disproportionality and that doing so does not jeopardize safety. Indeed it enhances the efficiency and effectiveness with which officers use stop and search powers. The challenge ahead is to build upon and deepen the use of stop data to strengthen communitypolice consultation and institutionalize resultsbased management of the use of stops including examining disproportionality effectiveness and the quality of encounters.

Abstract The current work explored law enforcement officers racial bias in decisions to shoot criminal suspects as well as their selfreported beliefs about Black versus White suspects. In addition this work examined what factors contribute to officers racial biases and the likelihood of having these biases eliminated. Examination of the officers explicit attitudes toward Black people and their beliefs about the criminality and difficulty of Black suspects revealed strong relationships with the quality of their contact with Black people on the job and in their personal lives. In addition officers with negative compared to more positive beliefs about the criminality of Black people were more likely to tend toward shooting unarmed Black suspects on a shooting simulation. However officers with positive contact with Black people in their personal lives were particularly able to eliminate these biases with training on the simulation. The findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the training of law enforcement personnel. Please find document here. Abstract The current work examined police officers decisions to shoot Black and White criminal suspects in a computer simulation. Responses to the simulation revealed that upon initial exposure to the program the officers were more likely to mistakenly shoot unarmed Black compared with unarmed White suspects. However after extensive training with the program in which the race of the suspect was unrelated to the presence of a weapon the officers were able to eliminate this bias. These findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the elimination of racial biases and the training of police officers. Please find document here. Abstract We examined implicit race biases in the decision to shoot potentially hostile targets in a multiethnic context. Results of two studies showed that collegeaged participants and police officers showed antiBlack racial bias in their response times they were quicker to correctly shoot armed Black targets and to indicate don t shoot for unarmed Latino Asian and White targets. In addition police officers showed racial biases in response times toward Latinos versus Asians or Whites and surprisingly toward Whites versus Asians. Results also showed that the accuracy of decisions to shoot was higher for Black and Latino targets than for White and Asian targets. Finally the degree of bias shown by police officers toward Blacks was related to contact attitudes and stereotypes. Overestimation of community violent crime correlated with greater bias toward Latinos but less toward Whites. Implications for police training to ameliorate biases are discussed. Please see here. Abstract To explore the way in which the interpretation of ambiguous social behavior can be influenced by racial stereotypes and cultural differences 40 black and 40 white 6thgrade males were shown a variety of ambiguously aggressive behaviors performed by black and white stimulus figures. As predicted both black and white preadolescents rated these behaviors as more mean and threatening when the perpetrator was black than when he was white. In contrast ratings of personal characteristics were in general determined by individual behavior rather than by group stereotypes although blacks whether they were the perpetrator or the recipient of the behaviors were rated as stronger than their white counterparts. Cultural differences between subject groups were apparent in the greater tendency of the white children to read threat into ambiguously aggressive behaviors involving no physical contact and to assume that the perpetrators of such behaviors were stronger than the recipients.

If you re a member of an historically marginalized group enacting change in an organization can be challenging. This is likely even more difficult if your organization is known for bias and even violence against your own group. This is the position many Black police officers are in and researchers wanted to better understand the strategies they use to advocate for antiracism despite the numerous roadblocks. This article looks at why Black police officers choose the job how they challenge racism and how they sustain their efforts. It also offers suggestions for employees in other fields can continue to fight for change in their own companies. New research shows how employees in any industry can make an impact through everyday antiracist actions. The 2014 shooting death of Black teenager Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson Missouri was an early event that propelled the Black Lives Matter movement to national prominence and elevated discussions of race and policing in the United States. In the summer of 2020 the murder of George Floyd sparked a racial reckoning in the U.S. and around the world that further magnified calls for police reform. Consequently police departments around the country have begun to adopt antiracist organizational policies like offering diversity training and increasing recruitment of officers who are members of racial minority groups.

https://counciloncj.foleon.com/policing/assessing-the-evidence/vii-implicit-bias, Research indicates that all humans make automatic unconscious associations about groups of people based on their culture identity upbringing and larger societal biases. In the context of policing such biases may influence officer behaviors leading to racial disparities across a variety of policing activities including stops frisks arrests and uses of force. Implicit bias training is designed to help officers develop awareness of their personal implicit biases understand how those biases can influence their behaviors and devise ways to prevent biases from leading to disparate treatment of members of the public particularly with regard to the use of force.  The concept of implicit bias has its roots in cognitive psychology and is based on findings that the human ability to recollect encode store and retrieve data occurs unconsciously and is activated automatically and uncontrollably. Biases are embedded in these unconscious responses as evidenced by the wellknown Implicit Association Test IAT which reveals biases through rapidword associations. These implicit biases which pertain to race and gender among other identifying characteristics are correlated with explicit measures of bias and discriminatory behaviors.  In recent years the notion that implicit biases among officers contribute to racial disparities in police stops searches frisks uses of force and arrests has gained prominence leading to the proliferation of implicit bias training in law enforcement agencies. According to a 2019 survey of 150 large police departments 69 offered some form of implicit bias training. Implicit bias training is distinctly different from most other forms of police training in that it aims to change officers behaviors by altering their attitudes and thinking patterns rather than focusing on tactics and processes. Implicit bias training explains that everyone has implicit biases illustrates how such biases manifest in policing describes how biases affect outcomes for community members officers and agencies and teaches skills that help officers recognize their biases and alter their reactions. The training is intended to teach officers to slow down check their personal biases and assumptions and conduct themselves in an equitable and impartial manner. Some forms of implicit bias training also encourage officers to make connections with members of identity groups other than their own as a means of negating stereotypes that may be ingrained and may fuel biased interactions. Studies indicate that police implicit bias training is typically delivered in a classroombased environment is of limited duration typically eight hours and is presented during a onetime event with no booster or followup trainings.  In terms of content there is some controversy over the value of implicit bias training. Some critics question whether implicit bias training gives bad actors a pass everyone has implicit biases so it s fine if you have them you are still a good person rather than addressing explicit biases head on. The counterargument is that naming explicit biases will prompt defensiveness and lead some share of officers arguably those who could most benefit from the training to shut down. Worse yet some scholars have observed that conscious efforts to control implicit biases may actually increase biased judgments. Questions also persist about the degree to which implicit bias training can influence officer behaviors in the field given that such biases are reactive and based on strong mental associations that are ingrained over time and reinforced by societal biases and environmental and contextual factors. Some academics have questioned whether it would be more impactful to reduce the volume of highdiscretion police stops those that are officerinitiated such as broken tail light stops and pedestrian stops and frisks as a means of reducing biased policing. Others suggest that it would be more effective to focus on changing behavioral norms rather than seeking to diminish underlying biases or enhance awareness of them. This suggests that implicit bias training might pair well with dutytointervene and mandatory reporting policies both of which when implemented alongside accountability measures underscore the expectation that wrongdoers including those who police in a biased manner will not be tolerated. However more research is needed to assess whether this type of paired response is effective.  In some cases implicit bias training is coupled with reconciliation practices creating opportunities for police to become familiar with recognize and apologize on the part of the agency and jurisdiction for past harms especially the biased treatment of Black people and other marginalized populations e.g. the LGBTQIA community. This process involves excavating the history of abusive policing practices toward people of color from their roots in slavery and evolution into Jim Crow laws and examining more recent criminal justice practices that are oppressive to marginalized populations. One dimension of the work involves recognition by police that some members of the public may hold their own implicit biases about police based upon this history. While research has documented the ability of reconciliation processes to mend deepseated wounds inflicted by members of dominant groups on subjugated populations no research has identified the degree to which they may bolster police implicit bias trainings and promote less disparate policing practices.  Despite the growth and prevalence of police implicit bias training strong evaluations on its effectiveness are scarce. One rigorous study of the New York Police Department examined the impact of the Fair and Impartial Policing training on police activities and interactions with members of the public. The curriculum consisted of an eighthour training divided over six modules which together are designed to heighten participants awareness of their biases and equip them with tolls to manage them in order to neutralize their effects. This curriculum was delivered to over 15000 officers at randomized prespecified points in time. Pre and posttraining surveys of participants detected modest and shortterm effects on officers recognition of personal biases. But researchers found no correlation between the training and changes in racial disparities in stops frisks searches and use of force during stops arrests use of force in arrests summonses or citizen complaints.Other research has been confined solely to the question of whether officers trained in implicit bias expressed an understanding and increased awareness of the concept of biases and the way they can influence decisionmaking. For example evaluators conducted surveys prior to and following an eighthour classroombased implicit bias training in the six police departments involved in a pilot program conducted by the National Initiative for Building Community Trust and Justice. Researchers found that immediately following the training officers had greater understanding of the potential for implicit biases to yield disparate impacts as well as an improved knowledge of the situational factors that influence their decisions. The evaluation did not include an examination of the degree to which such understanding influenced officer behaviors in the field.  Evaluations of implicit bias training in nonpolicing contexts can be helpful in understanding the potential effectiveness of implicit bias training in police departments. Research has found that onetime interventions can result in shortterm reductions in implicit biases but those reductions do not persist over time. Evidence from social psychological research on implicit bias in general not specific to policing suggests that longerduration and more intensive interventions including those focused on repeated practice may prove more effective. In addition a randomized controlled trial of university faculty trained in gender bias awareness found that treatment group members were more likely to report taking actions to promote gender equity following the training.  Research has not documented any impact of implicit bias training on use of force. However to the extent that the training leads officers to slow down and reconsider their responses to members of the public in real time misuse of force could be reduced. Implicit bias training on its own is unlikely to enhance an agency s transparency or accountability.  Agencies that invest in implicit bias training that includes reconciliation conversations may strengthen community trust by repairing relationships with communities of color. Implicit bias training is specifically designed to reduce the racially disparate treatment of members of the public by police but there is no evidence that such training is effective. If implicit bias training leads officers to refrain from misuse of force officer and community member safety will be enhanced. However no evidence exists tying implicit bias training to reductions in use of force. Public safety may be improved if implicit bias training combined with complementary reconciliation practices builds trust in communities experiencing high volumes of crime. Under such a scenario residents would be more likely to report crimes they witness and experience cooperate in investigations and partner in crimeprevention measures.  Updated May 12 2021. This revised version reflects changes in research on outcomes around implicit bias.
https://police.nd.edu/our-mission/equity-in-policing/, Notre Dame Police Department A Message from The University of Notre Dame Police Department We as members of the Notre Dame Police Department must stand together with our community in the wake of injustices that have been plaguing our nation and our communities. We must not allow the seeds of discord and racial intolerance to take root in our department or in our lives. We know that at times law enforcement in the United States has played a role in dehumanization oppression and the infringement of the basic civil and human rights of people in our country. Instances of police brutality are tragic reminders of the systemic racism that exists in the United States. We recognize that NDPD is part of the larger criminal justice system that needs to improve in many ways. These truths are uncomfortable they stain our history and tarnish the reputation of good people doing good work. But they are truths that are nonetheless acknowledged by the Notre Dame Police Department. We as members of the Notre Dame Police Department must stand with our community in the wake of injustices that have been plaguing our nation and our communities. We must not allow the seeds of discord and racial intolerance to take root in our department or in our lives. We acknowledge the pain anger and frustration felt by so many members of our community particularly our Black and Brown brothers and sisters. We acknowledge the fear and the mistrust. We acknowledge that we have a calling that is much higher than ourselves. We have a duty to listen and to empathize. We have a duty to act. To act with integrity with compassion with empathy and with kindness. We have a duty to act when we witness oppression and injustices that are taking place even if it means confronting our colleagues or our supervisors or leaders. We have a duty to help drive positive change in our own department and the larger criminal justice system. We must be a force for good. We must continue to provide an environment where students faculty and staff and guests and visitors can come and experience all that Our Lady s University has to offer without fear. We must hold ourselves and each other to a higher standard and we must stand up for those who are unable or feel that they cannot stand for themselves. We must be part of continued conversation and as the police department entrusted with protecting and serving the Notre Dame community we must always examine ourselves and take action to be the best we can be for all of Notre Dame. It is in that spirit that we make available to our community the following sections containing information concerning the Notre Dame Police Department s training and certain operational practices as well as certain departmental information. The first highlights some of our department s critically important training and policies. Although this list is not exhaustive we will continue to engage with our community and train and adapt our policy and procedures based on feedback and best practice to continuously improve our service delivery to the University. The second section highlights information about the department and how we hold ourselves accountable and are accountable to the Notre Dame community. Our Response to Resistance Policy is consistent with best practice useofforce policies. It requires officers only to use force when objectively reasonable and to immediately cease using force once their lawful objective is attained. Our officers are not trained to use neck restraints or chokeholds and our training on use of force or response to resistance consider holds to the neck or head to be deadly force and only to be used if necessary to save the life of an officer or 3rd party. One of the guiding principles of our policy and training is the sanctity of every human life. Our policy also requires any officer who sees excessive use of force taking place to immediately protect the citizen and report the excessive force to a supervisor who shall then inform the Chief. It also requires officers to report any use of force which would include pointing a firearm Taser or pepper spray at someone even if the officer does not discharge the firearm Taser or pepper spray. Our policy and training are consistent with PERFs 30 Guiding Principles on Use of Force. Every use of force is immediately reviewed to ensure that it was necessary and consistent with the laws of the United States and State of Indiana and our policies mission and values. NDPD has developed a policy that does not allow dispatchers to send officers to a call if the call is based solely on suspicions about a persons appearance. Dispatchers are trained to ask followup questions to determine if there is suspicious behavior before sending an officer. Last year NDPD only used force three times. In all three instances the force used was physical in nature e.g. an armbar technique or double leg takedown. We had three additional Response to Resistance also known as a use of force forms completed during that same time period. These are instances when any implement of force Taser pepper spray handgun etc. is drawn and verbal commands given. This is not something that most departments count as a use of force but we do and evaluate each time it happens. 3 of the subjects in these incidents were graduate students and the other 3 had no affiliation with the University. NDPD tracks the race of every individual who is stopped warned cited arrested or issued a No Trespass or NonContractual Interest Notice. Last year NDPD arrested only one student. NDPD leadership reviews these demographic reports every 6 months to look for any concerning trends. We continually review our policies to ensure they are in line with progressive policing best practices including guidance provided by organizations like PERF IACLEA International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators The Presidents Task Force on 21st Century Policing. NDPD meets regularly with members of the student diversity council and various student clubs to work on relationship building. We also participate in retreats focused on identity and inclusion and are open to participating in others to help build and deepen relationships. This year we will invite student clubs and employee resource groups to engage in unity summits with NDPD staff. We have been focused on diversity in recruitment and have expanded our possibilities for hiring. We review our candidate pools with a diversity recruiter. We also have an internship program that has been utilized extensively by interns of color some of whom have been hired into other police departments. We are committed to the pursuit of sharing truth for its own sake. If you have questions or want to have an open constructive conversation please contact us by email at policend.edu. We want our culture to be inclusive supportive developmental collaborative professional compassionate and empathetic. NDPD is committed to establishing and maintaining a department culture that is mission driven and values based. Our core values include the University s values of accountability teamwork integrity leadership in excellence and leadership in mission and our department values of respect integrity service and excellence. We consider our role to be that of community caretakers and problem solvers. We work to establish trust both within the department and with individuals and entities within the community. We strive to have an environment where it is safe to speak up people are expected to and want to take ownership of their responsibilities and actions and there is a culture of mutual accountability. We want our culture to be inclusive supportive developmental collaborative professional compassionate and empathetic. We regularly check in on these elements of culture for our department generally within individual teams within the department and when we review incidents or events. We want to be a police department that is uniquely Notre Dame and attentive and responsive to the unique needs of our community and all of its members. Your Rights and Responsibilities includes a description of some interactions you may have with police officers on campus. It is intended to help you understand what to expect from officers how you should respond in these situations and what your rights are.

Justice.GovPoliceDiversity httpswww.eeoc.govadvancingdiversitylawenforcement Today our country is in the midst of an unprecedented national conversation on communitypolice relations. All across our nation from small suburban hamlets to large urban centers tragic events have brought to the forefront underlying issues about the ways in which law enforcement agencies engage with the communities that they are sworn to protect and serve. Two years ago President Obama established a Task Force on 21st Century Policing for the purpose of identifying the best means to provide an effective partnership between law enforcement and local communities that reduces crime and increases trust. Among its recommendations the Task Force identified increasing the diversity of the nations law enforcement agencies as an important aspect in developing that trust. Building on this effort in December 2015 our agencies the U.S. Department of Justices Civil Rights Division and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission EEOC joined together to launch Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement an interagency research initiative designed to help our nations law enforcement agencies recruit hire retain and promote officers that reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. While we fully recognize that increasing diversity in law enforcement agencies alone cannot solve the myriad challenges in policing or address every concern about public trust in law enforcement enhancing diversity must be part of the conversation about improving relations between law enforcement and communities. Both the Civil Rights Division and the EEOC are tasked with enforcing federal civil rights but we are also well aware that enforcement efforts which are critical tools in combating barriers ensuring compliance and advancing reforms are most effective when paired with robust outreach stakeholder engagement and practical tools and resources. It is with this understanding that we launched the Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement initiative and that we issue the enclosed report today. This report aims not only to frame the issue of diversity within the larger national conversation but also to document common barriers and highlight promising efforts already underway in law enforcement agencies. This report does not mark the end of our work on these important issues. Rather it provides a framework that we hope will spur further dialogue and reform around the country as we continue to engage with law enforcement and local communities. We want to acknowledge the work of the Center for Policing Equity CPE which served as our partner throughout this initiative. CPEs research analysis and expertise were critical throughout the process. We also want to thank the hundreds of individuals from across the nation who agreed to participate in this effort. Over the course of the last year we conducted extensive outreach with law enforcement leaders officers and command staff national policing organizations federal law enforcement agencies community stakeholders and others in order to hear directly from you about the challenges you face the changes you are working to implement and the resources and tools you need to accelerate the pace of progress. Law enforcement is a rewarding demanding rigorous and as recent events painfully remind us dangerous profession. We have the utmost respect for the men and women who wear the badge and serve our communities the vast majority of whom perform their jobs with professionalism honor and integrity. As we reflect on the challenges in our communities today we know that you are asking the hard questions and refusing to settle for easy answers. We hope you find this report to be a useful resource as you continue to engage in the tough vital work of bringing our law enforcement agencies and communities closer. Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney GeneralCivil Rights Division U.S. Department of Justice The Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement initiative was undertaken as a joint effort between the Department of Justices Civil Rights Division and the EEOC. We thank the staff and leadership teams from both agencies who contributed significant time resources and expertise in producing the final report. In particular we want to acknowledge the Civil Rights Divisions Employment Litigation Section Policy Section and Office of Special Counsel for ImmigrationRelated Unfair Employment Practices as well as the EEOCs Office of the Chair Office of Commissioner Charlotte Burrows Office of Legal Counsel Office of Field Programs Office of Research Information and Planning and Office of General Counsel for their stewardship of this effort. We also thank CPE including R. Nicole JohnsonAhorlu Ph.D. Kat Kiyoko Amano Chris Burbank Laura Cervantes Ph.D. Kimberly Burke M.A. Kristen Powell Summer Joi Robins and Phillip Atiba Goff Ph.D. for their research assistance and support throughout. We also want to acknowledge our colleagues throughout the Federal government including the Department of Justices Office of Community Oriented Policing Services and Office of Justice Programs as well as the Department of Labor for their assistance throughout this effort. We want to thank the many law enforcement associations civil rights organizations academics and others we met with or spoke to as part of this initiative including the International Association of Chiefs of Police Major Cities Chiefs Association Women in Federal Law Enforcement National Association of Women Law Enforcement Executives Hispanic American Police Command Officers Association National Asian Peace Officers Association National Latino Peace Officers Association National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives Fraternal Order of Police and National Association of Police Organizations for their important contributions to the issues discussed in our report. As part of this initiative we also met with our colleagues in federal law enforcement at the Federal Bureau of Investigation the U.S. Marshals Service the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives and the Drug Enforcement Administration. We thank them for their engagement constructive feedback and candid dialogue about the critical issues around diversity in law enforcement. Above all this report is designed to serve as a resource for all law enforcement agencies particularly small and mediumsize agencies grappling with the challenges around increasing diversity and working hard to implement effective impactful and promising practices for change. Several local law enforcement leaders around the country took the time to meet and speak with us sharing their unique perspectives about the challenges they have encountered and the promising practices they are either already using or considering using to recruit hire and retain a diverse officer corps. Many of the law enforcement leaders we spoke with directly acknowledged that despite innovative and dedicated efforts barriers still exist and they fully recognize the challenges that remain. We thank these leaders for their engagement candid assessment of these challenges and clear desire to lead substantive discussions and reforms. Tragic events over the past several years including officerinvolved shootings and attacks on law enforcement officers and the demonstrations and protests these incidents have spawned have captured the publics attention and driven a host of policing issues from the periphery to the center of our public dialogue including a renewed focus on increasing diversity in the nations law enforcement agencies. In December 2014 President Obama announced his Task Force on 21st Century Policing Task Force. The Task Force brought together a diverse range of stakeholders including law enforcement leaders advocates academics policymakers and community members to explore strategies for strengthening communitypolice relations reducing crime and advancing public safety. In one of its key recommendations for building trust and legitimacy in communitypolice relations the Task Force focused on the need to ensure law enforcement agencies better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. Although the spotlight on these issues may seem new to some for many including law enforcement personnel government officials and community leaders this is only one part of a decadeslong conversation about how law enforcement and the communities they serve can best work together. Many law enforcement agencies as well as organizations that work with law enforcement have devoted considerable time energy and attention in their efforts to recruit and retain workforces that reflect the diversity within their jurisdictions. For many years the Federal government has also worked to address challenges and barriers to diversity in law enforcement. The U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission continue to lead robust enforcement data analysis and technical assistance efforts to address diversity in law enforcement. Yet these efforts by themselves cannot reach all of the more than 18000 law enforcement agencies in the country. Indeed voluntary efforts by law enforcement employers are an equally if not more important way to advance diversity and further equal employment opportunity. Toward that end in December 2015 the Departments Civil Rights Division and the EEOC launched a new research initiative Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement both to identify barriers that undermine diversity in law enforcement and to highlight promising practices that help agencies better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. The initiative has focused on barriers and promising practices across three key areas recruitment hiring and retention. In so doing this initiative has taken a broad examination of various barriers to diversity while also placing particular emphasis on practices that advance greater racial and gender diversity and that foster the inclusion of the perspectives and experiences of persons of diverse backgrounds in the culture and leadership of law enforcement agencies. This initiative was created to assist law enforcement agencies throughout the country as they strive to build workforces that better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. It is the hope that this effort will especially aid those small and mediumsize police departments that recognize the importance of diversity but may lack the resources to fully explore solutions. The challenge of recruiting hiring and retaining a diverse workforce is certainly not limited to law enforcement. Throughout the country in nearly every sector of society people and organizations are grappling with this issue. Employers in a variety of industries have engaged in proactive efforts to bolster diversity. Yet this challenge remains particularly urgent in the field of law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies fulfill a fundamental role in our society and in many communities individual police officers are often the public face of local government. It therefore is critical that our nations law enforcement agencies broadly reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. As the Task Force recognized increased diversity within law enforcement agencies defined not only in terms of race and gender but also other characteristics including religion sexual orientation gender identity language ability background and experience serves as a critically important tool to build trust with communities. This finding is bolstered by decades of research confirming that when members of the public believe their law enforcement organizations represent them understand them and respond to them and when communities perceive authorities as fair legitimate and accountable it deepens trust in law enforcement instills public confidence in government and supports the integrity of democracy. This trust is essential to defusing tension to solving crimes and to creating a system in which residents view law enforcement as fair and just. Victims and witnesses of crime may not approach or engage with law enforcement if they do not perceive such authorities to be responsive to their experiences and concerns. This trust and the cooperation it facilitates also enables officers to more effectively and safely perform their jobs. Research further suggests that increased diversity can make law enforcement agencies more open to reform more willing to initiate cultural and systemic changes and more responsive to the residents they serve. Some have pointed to increased diversity as a catalyst for reform enabling officers and law enforcement leaders alike to become more introspective and reflective about problems in their departments. A more reflective and openminded culture in an agency can help drive reform across a range of areas including civilian oversight community policing and racial bias. In addition while greater workforce diversity alone cannot ensure fair and effective policing a significant and growing body of evidence suggests that diversity can have a positive influence on specific activities and practices of law enforcement agencies. Despite their efforts law enforcement agencies of all sizes have not always been successful in recruiting and attracting individuals that reflects the communities they serve. This is likely attributable to a number of factors that are present in the recruiting hiring and retention phases. In identifying policies and practices that have served as barriers to recruiting hiring and retaining a workforce that reflects the diversity of the community this report is not suggesting that law enforcement agencies should necessarily abandon those policies or practices. In fact some of these policies and practices result from requirements of federal state andor local laws. However to the extent agencies are trying to increase the diversity of their workforces they need to recognize that these barriers may impede their ability to do so and develop strategies to compensate for the barriers undesired impact. By adopting proactive and intentional recruitment hiring and retention strategies law enforcement agencies can address barriers drive reform and make progress in ensuring that their workforces better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. The report highlights promising practices identified through existing online materials independent research and interviews that various law enforcement agencies have found to be particularly effective at increasing their diversity. Given the sheer number of law enforcement agencies in this country this report does not provide a comprehensive examination of promising practices that have been developed and are being used but it does provide a number of salient examples focused on the key areas of i recruitment ii hiring and iii retention. Although the practices adopted by law enforcement agencies vary considerably this report demonstrates that successful diversitybuilding efforts by law enforcement agencies share several common themes including Law enforcement agencies that are committed to increasing the diversity of their workforces and ensuring that the demographic makeup of their sworn officers reflect the diversity of the communities they serve face a plethora of challenges. These challenges which manifest themselves at every stage of the recruitment selection and retention processes are daunting but as the experiences of the law enforcement agencies highlighted in this report make clear they are far from insurmountable. In fact agencies that have undertaken this effort have found that increased diversity brings a range of benefits that can be seen both within their workforces as well as in their relations with the communities they serve. It is the hope that this reports discussion of barriers that inhibit diversity and the promising practices that have been adopted and are being used in jurisdictions all across the country provide a useful resource for law enforcement agencies particularly those that may not have the internal resources to undertake this type of review themselves. At the same time the work done for the Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement initiative has revealed a number of unanswered questions and areas for future research and review. Specifically This report does not represent the end of the U.S. Department of Justices Civil Rights Division and the EEOCs work around these important issues. The Federal government remains committed to partnering with law enforcement agencies from all across the country to assist them in their efforts to better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. B. Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement Initiative II. Why Diversity in Law Enforcement Matters III. Current State of Diversity in American Law Enforcement VI. Promising Practices for Increasing Diversity Appendix A Lessons Learned from Enforcement of Federal Civil Rights Laws Appendix B Updated Literature Review Appendix C List of Organizations and Stakeholders Consulted During the summer of 2014 the nations attention turned to the small city of Ferguson Missouri which was embroiled in protests and civil unrest following the tragic shooting of Michael Brown an 18yearold AfricanAmerican resident by a white officer from the Ferguson Police Department. While much of the attention focused on the range of systemic problems and significant challenges in the relationship between law enforcement and the community in Ferguson discussion also turned to the demographics of the Ferguson Police Department. Several news organizations reportedthat there was a severe imbalance between the racial composition of the police department and the demographics of the community they observed that although African Americans comprised a majority of Fergusons population only three of the citys 53 commissioned police officers were African American.1 Similarly when the Department of Justice Department published its investigative findings from its systematic review of the Ferguson Police Department in March 2015 the review found that while African Americans comprise roughly 67 percent of the citys population they accounted for less than 8 percent of its police force. The report concluded that the police departments lack of racial diversity when combined with other factors undermined and damaged community trust in the police.2 But Ferguson is far from an anomaly in this regard. A disconnect between the composition of law enforcement agencies and the demographics of the communities they serve can be found throughout our country.3 A New York Times analysis of data collected by the Federal government found that in hundreds of police departments across the country the proportion of whites on the force is more than 30 percentage points higher than in the communities they serve.4 Another publication Governing conducted a similar analysis with the same dataset and reached nearly identical conclusions racial and ethnic minorities are underrepresented by a combined 24 percentage points on average when each police departments sworn officer demographics are compared with Census estimates for the general public.5 Tragic events over the past several years including officerinvolved shootings and attacks on law enforcement officers and the demonstrations and protests these incidents have spawned have captured the publics attentionand driven a host of policing issues from the periphery to the center of our public dialogue including a renewed focus on increasing diversity in the nations law enforcement agencies.6 For example following the recent fatal attack on police officers in Dallas Texas the Dallas police chief specifically encouraged young AfricanAmerican men who had been protesting the actions of his law enforcement agency to apply to work there.7 Other law enforcement leaders have issued similar public appeals in response to demonstrations and social unrest in their jurisdictions.8 In December 2014 President Obama announced his Task Force on 21st Century Policing. The Task Force brought together a diverse range of stakeholders including law enforcement leaders advocates academics policymakers and community members to explore strategies for strengthening communitypolice relations reducing crime and advancing public safety. The 59 recommendations detailed in the Task Forces May 2015 final report provide law enforcement and communities with a roadmap to rebuild trust and to advance effective constitutional and communityoriented policing. In one of its key recommendations for building trust and legitimacy in communitypolice relations the Task Force focused on the need to ensure law enforcement agencies better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve.9 Law enforcement agencies should strive to create a workforce that contains a broad range of diversity including race gender language life experience and cultural background to improve understanding and effectiveness in dealing with all communities.  Final Report of the Presidents Task Force on 21st Century Policing Although greater diversity in law enforcement agencies is not a cureall solution to improving policecommunity relations the Task Force did identify diversity as a key element a necessary piece of the conversation around reform and an important factor in evaluating the multiple causes of fragmented trust. Although the spotlight on these issues is more prominent than it has been in the past for many including law enforcement personnel government officials and community leaders this is only one piece of a decadeslong conversation about how law enforcement and the communities they serve can best work together. Efforts to advance diversity within the law enforcement profession have been particularly challenging. In fact this is one of the issues that led Congress in 1972 to provide the Federal government with greater authority to enforce the employment discrimination provisions of Title VII of the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 Title VII against state and local public employers including law enforcement agencies.10 And as one scholar has observed virtually every national report on the police over the past twenty years has recommended increased employment of minorities and women.11 Many law enforcement agencies as well as organizations that work with law enforcement have devoted considerable time energy and attention in their efforts to recruit and retain workforces that reflect the diversity within their jurisdictions.12 For many years the Federal government has also worked to address challenges and barriers to diversity in law enforcement. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the agency tasked with primary responsibility for enforcing Federal employment discrimination laws enforces Title VII as well as the other protections that forbid employers from discriminating against job applicants or employees. Additionally the EEOC collects and analyzes workforce demographic data from large employers including law enforcement agencies and upon request has provided technical assistance to these agencies. The U.S. Department of Justice has also been engaged in a variety of efforts to address the diversity of the nations law enforcement agencies. The Departments Civil Rights Divisionworks jointly with the EEOC in enforcing Title VII13 and has successfully brought numerous civil actions against police departments state correctional organizations and first responder agencies challenging unlawful discriminatory employment hiring and promotion practices.14 The Division also enforces the antidiscrimination provision of the Immigration and Nationality ActINA which prohibits employers including law enforcement agencies from discriminating against job applicants because of their national origin it also prohibits citizenship or immigration status discrimination where such distinctions are not otherwise authorized by law. In addition through the Divisions enforcement of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 the Division has entered into courtenforceable consent decrees that among other measures have focused on the need for jurisdictions to increase the diversity within their law enforcement agencies.15 The Departments Office of Community Oriented Policing Services COPS and Office of Justice Programs also have been engaged in efforts around this issue.16 Through this work as well as the efforts of other Federal agencies17 the Federal government has been actively working to promote greater diversity in the nations law enforcement agencies. While the Department of Justice and EEOC continue to lead robust enforcement data analysis and technical assistance efforts to address diversity in law enforcement we also recognize that these efforts by themselves cannot reach all of the more than 18000 law enforcement agencies in this country. Indeed voluntary efforts by law enforcement employers are essential to advance diversity and further equal employment opportunity. Toward that end in December 2015 the Departments Civil Rights Division and the EEOC launched a new research initiative Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement to identify barriers that undermine diversity in law enforcement and highlight promising practices that help agencies better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. The initiative has focused on barriers and promising practices across three key areas recruitment hiring and retention. In so doing this initiative has taken a broad look at a number of barriers to diversity while placing particular emphasis on practices that advance greater racial and gender diversity and that foster the inclusion of the perspectives and experiences of persons of diverse backgrounds in the culture and leadership of law enforcement agencies.18 This initiative was created to assist law enforcement agencies throughout the country as they strive to build workforces that better reflect the diversity of the communities they serve and to especially aid those small and mediumsize police departments that recognize the importance of diversity but may lack the resources to fully explore solutions.19 This report lays out the results of that effort. Of particular salience is the collection of promising practices that are being developed and implemented by law enforcement agencies across the country. To be sure none of these practices can guarantee increased diversity within an agency as discussed in greater detail below strategies for successfully recruiting hiring and retaining officers are inherently localized practices that depend upon a variety of factors and contexts that are not easily summarized. Moreover adoption of any of these practices by themselves will not necessarily ensure compliance with all legal obligations related to equal employment opportunity.20 Nevertheless the experiences of law enforcement agencies taking steps to increase the diversity of their workforces provides useful information for others who are or wish to be engaged in similar efforts. Underlying this effort is the recognition that the Federal government should improve its own diversity as well. In 2011 President Obama issued an executive orderestablishing a coordinated governmentwide initiative to promote diversity and inclusion within the Federal workforce.21 And after data revealed a decline in the number of racial minorities serving as special agents within the Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey described the issue as a crisis and affirmed the agencys commitment to reversing that trend.22 Throughout this initiative the Departments Civil Rights Division and the EEOC worked with law enforcement leaders civil rights advocates academic experts municipal officials and other stakeholders to take advantage of the considerable existing research and successful models that are being used by agencies all across the country to address barriers to diversity. CPE spearheaded much of these outreach and engagement efforts. Overall it is the hope that this Advancing Diversity in Law Enforcement initiative will advance ongoing conversations around this challenging and important issue and serve as a resource for law enforcement agencies and others across the country. The challenge of recruiting hiring and retaining a diverse workforce is certainly not limited to law enforcement. Throughout the country in nearly every sector of society people and organizations are grappling with this issue. Employers in a variety of industries have engaged in proactive efforts to expand opportunity and strengthen diversity.24 Yet this challenge remains particularly urgent in the field of law enforcement. Law enforcement agencies fulfill a fundamental role in our society and in many communities individual police are often the public face of local government. It therefore is critical that our nations law enforcement agencies broadly reflect the diversity of the communities they serve. As the Task Force recognized increased diversity within law enforcement agencies defined not only in terms of race and gender but also other characteristics including religion sexual orientation gender identity language ability background and experience serves as a critically important tool to build trust with communities.25 This finding is bolstered by decades of research confirming that when members of the public believe their law enforcement organizations represent them understand them and respond to them and when communities perceive authorities as fair legitimate and accountable it enhances trust in law enforcement instills public confidence in government and supports the integrity of democracy.26 This trust is essential to defusing tension to solving crimes and to creating a system in which residents view law enforcement as fair and just. Members of the public including victims and witnesses of crime may not approach or engage with law enforcement if they do not perceive such authorities to be responsive to their experiences and concerns. This trust and the cooperation it facilitates also enables officers to more effectively and safely perform their jobs. Research further suggests that increased diversity also can make law enforcement agencies more open to reform more willing to initiate cultural and systemic changes and more responsive to the residents they serve. Some have pointed to increased diversity as a catalyst for reform enabling officers and law enforcement leaders alike to become more introspective and reflective about problems with their departments. A more reflective and openminded culture in an agency can help drive reform across a range of areas including civilian oversight community policing and racial bias.27 Additionally a commitment to diversity by law enforcement agencies ensures that crucial public sector jobs are available to all eligible qualified candidates and therefore helps ensure equal employment opportunity for all. Positions within law enforcement agencies often serve as the backbone of many communities offering rewarding longterm careers. Jobs in law enforcement create new pathways of economic opportunity for men and women motivated to serve their community and work hard to provide for their families and lift themselves into the middle class. In addition while greater workforce diversity alone cannot ensure fair and effective policing a significant and growing body of evidence suggests that diversity can have a positive influence on specific activities and practices of law enforcement agencies. Decades of research has identified the considerable tangible benefits resulting from an increased numbers of female officers within law enforcement agencies. For example this research has shown not only that female officers are just as competent and effective as their male counterparts in carrying out law enforcement functions but also that female officers are more likely to use a style of policing that relies less on physical force. Consequently female officers generally are less likely than their male counterparts to unnecessarily use either deadly or excessive force.28 Female officers have been shown to be more likely to implement communityoriented policing approaches which place greater focus on communication and cooperation with the public.29 Female officers also have been found to be more responsive to situations involving violence against women which comprise the majority of
https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/02/solving-racial-disparities-in-policing/, Protesters take a knee in front of New York City police officers during a solidarity rally for George Floyd June 4 2020.  Unequal is a multipart series highlighting the work of Harvard faculty staff students alumni and researchers on issues of race and inequality across the U.S. The first part explores the experience of people of color with the criminal justice legal system in America. It seems there s no end to them. They are the recent videos and reports of Black and brown people beaten or killed by law enforcement officers and they have fueled a national outcry over the disproportionate use of excessive and often lethal force against people of color and galvanized demands for police reform. This is not the first time in recent decades that highprofile police violence from the 1991 beating of Rodney King to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 ignited calls for change. But this time appears different. The police killings of Breonna Taylor in March George Floyd in May and a string of others triggered historic widespread marches and rallies across the nation from small towns to major cities drawing protesters of unprecedented diversity in race gender and age. According to historians and other scholars the problem is embedded in the story of the nation and its culture. Rooted in slavery racial disparities in policing and police violence they say are sustained by systemic exclusion and discrimination and fueled by implicit and explicit bias. Any solution clearly will require myriad new approaches to law enforcement courts and community involvement and comprehensive social change driven from the bottom up and the top down. While police reform has become a major focus the current moment of national reckoning has widened the lens on systemic racism for many Americans. The range of issues though less familiar to some is well known to scholars and activists. Across Harvard for instance faculty members have long explored the ways inequality permeates every aspect of American life. Their research and scholarship sits at the heart of a new Gazette series starting today aimed at finding ways forward in the areas of democracy wealth and opportunity environment and health and education. It begins with this first on policing. Harvard Kennedy School Professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad traces the history of policing in America to slave patrols in the antebellum South in which white citizens were expected to help supervise the movements of enslaved Black people. Like many scholars Khalil Gibran Muhammad professor of history race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School traces the history of policing in America to slave patrols in the antebellum South in which white citizens were expected to help supervise the movements of enslaved Black people. This legacy he believes can still be seen in policing today. The surveillance the deputization essentially of all white men to be police officers or in this case slave patrollers and then to dispense corporal punishment on the scene are all baked in from the very beginning he told NPR last year. Slave patrols and the slave codes they enforced ended after the Civil War and the passage of the 13th amendment which formally ended slavery except as a punishment for crime. But Muhammad notes that former Confederate states quickly used that exception to justify new restrictions. Known as the Black codes the various rules limited the kinds of jobs African Americans could hold their rights to buy and own property and even their movements.  The genius of the former Confederate states was to say Oh well if all we need to do is make them criminals and they can be put back in slavery well then that s what we ll do. And that s exactly what the Black codes set out to do. The Black codes for all intents and purposes criminalized every form of African American freedom and mobility political power economic power except the one thing it didn t criminalize was the right to work for a white man on a white man s terms. In particular he said the Ku Klux Klan took about the business of terrorizing policing surveilling and controlling Black people. The Klan totally dominates the machinery of justice in the South.  When during what became known as the Great Migration millions of African Americans fled the still largely agrarian South for opportunities in the thriving manufacturing centers of the North they discovered that metropolitan police departments tended to enforce the law along racial and ethnic lines with newcomers overseen by those who came before. There was an early emphasis on people whose status was just a tiny notch better than the folks whom they were focused on policing Muhammad said. And so the AngloSaxons are policing the Irish or the Germans are policing the Irish. The Irish are policing the Poles. And then arrived a wave of Black Southerners looking for a better life. In his groundbreaking work The Condemnation of Blackness Race Crime and the Making of Modern Urban America Muhammad argues that an essential turning point came in the early 1900s amid efforts to professionalize police forces across the nation in part by using crime statistics to guide law enforcement efforts. For the first time Americans with European roots were grouped into one broad category white and set apart from the other category Black. Citing Muhammad s research Harvard historian Jill Lepore has summarized the consequences this way Police patrolled Black neighborhoods and arrested Black people disproportionately prosecutors indicted Black people disproportionately juries found Black people guilty disproportionately judges gave Black people disproportionately long sentences and then after all this social scientists observing the number of Black people in jail decided that as a matter of biology Black people were disproportionately inclined to criminality.   History shows that crime data was never objective in any meaningful sense Muhammad wrote. Instead crime statistics were weaponized to justify racial profiling police brutality and ever more policing of Black people. This phenomenon he believes has continued well into this century and is exemplified by William J. Bratton one of the most famous police leaders in recent America history. Known as America s Top Cop Bratton led police departments in his native Boston Los Angeles and twice in New York finally retiring in 2016. Bratton rejected notions that crime was a result of social and economic forces such as poverty unemployment police practices and racism. Instead he said in a 2017 speech It is about behavior. Through most of his career he was a proponent of statisticallybased predictive policing essentially placing forces in areas where crime numbers were highest focused on the groups found there. Bratton argued that the technology eliminated the problem of prejudice in policing without ever questioning potential bias in the data or algorithms themselves a significant issue given the fact that Black Americans are arrested and convicted of crimes at disproportionately higher rates than whites. This approach has led to widely discredited practices such as racial profiling and stopandfrisk. And Muhammad notes There is no research consensus on whether or how much violence dropped in cities due to policing.  In 2015 The Washington Post began tracking every fatal shooting by an onduty officer using news stories social media posts and police reports in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Brown a Black teenager in Ferguson Mo. According to the newspaper Black Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans and Hispanic Americans are also killed by police at a disproportionate rate. Such efforts have proved useful for researchers such as economist Rajiv Sethi. A Joy Foundation Fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute Sethi is investigating the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers a difficult task given that data from such encounters is largely unavailable from police departments. Instead Sethi and his team of researchers have turned to information collected by websites and news organizations including The Washington Post and The Guardian merged with data from other sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics the Census and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Joy Foundation Fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute Rajiv Sethi is investigating the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers They have found that exposure to deadly force is highest in the Mountain West and Pacific regions relative to the midAtlantic and northeastern states and that racial disparities in relation to deadly force are even greater than the national numbers imply. In the country as a whole you re about two to three times more likely to face deadly force if you re Black than if you are white said Sethi. But if you look at individual cities separately disparities in exposure are much higher.  Examining the characteristics associated with police departments that experience high numbers of lethal encounters is one way to better understand and address racial disparities in policing and the use of violence Sethi said but it s a massive undertaking given the decentralized nature of policing in America. There are roughly 18000 police departments in the country and more than 3000 sheriff s offices each with its own approaches to training and selection.  They behave in very different ways and what we re finding in our current research is that they are very different in the degree to which they use deadly force said Sethi. To make real change You really need to focus on the agency level where organizational culture lies where selection and training protocols have an effect and where leadership can make a difference.  Sethi pointed to the example of Camden N.J. which disbanded and replaced its police force in 2013 initially in response to a budget crisis but eventually resulting in an effort to fundamentally change the way the police engaged with the community. While there have been improvements including greater witness cooperation lower crime and fewer abuse complaints the Camden case doesn t fit any particular narrative said Sethi noting that the number of officers actually increased as part of the reform. While the city is still faced with its share of problems Sethi called its efforts to rethink policing important models from which we can learn.  For many analysts the real problem with policing in America is the fact that there is simply too much of it. We ve seen since the mid1970s a dramatic increase in expenditures that are associated with expanding the criminal legal system including personnel and the tasks we ask police to do said Sandra Susan Smith Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Professor of Criminal Justice at HKS and the Carol K. Pforzheimer Professor at the Radcliffe Institute. And at the same time we see dramatic declines in resources devoted to social welfare programs.   You can have all the armored personnel carriers you want in Ferguson but public safety is more likely to come from redressing environmental pollution poor education and unfair work said Brandon Terry assistant professor of African and African American Studies and social studies. Smith s comment highlights a key argument embraced by many activists and experts calling for dramatic police reform diverting resources from the police to better support community services including health care housing and education and stronger economic and job opportunities. They argue that broader support for such measures will decrease the need for policing and in turn reduce violent confrontations particularly in overpoliced economically disadvantaged communities and communities of color. For Brandon Terry that tension took the form of an ice container during his Baltimore high school chemistry final. The frozen cubes were placed in the middle of the classroom to help keep the students cool as a heat wave sent temperatures soaring. That was their solution to the building s lack of air conditioning said Terry a Harvard assistant professor of African and African American Studies and social studies. Just grab an ice cube.  Terry s story is the kind many researchers cite to show the negative impact of underinvesting in children who will make up the future population and instead devoting resources toward policing tactics that embrace armored vehicles automatic weapons and spy planes. Terry s is also the kind of tale promoted by activists eager to defund the police a movement begun in the late 1960s that has again gained momentum as the death toll from violent encounters mounts. A scholar of Martin Luther King Jr. Terry said the Civil Rights leader s views on the Vietnam War are echoed in the calls of activists today who are pressing to redistribute police resources.  King thought that the idea of spending many orders of magnitude more for an unjust war than we did for the abolition of poverty and the abolition of ghettoization was a moral travesty and it reflected a kind of sickness at the core of our society said Terry. And part of what the defund model is based upon is a similar moral criticism that these budgets reflect priorities that we have and our priorities are broken.  Terry also thinks the policing debate needs to be expanded to embrace a fuller understanding of what it means for people to feel truly safe in their communities. He highlights the work of sociologist Chris Muller and Harvard s Robert Sampson who have studied racial disparities in exposures to lead and the connections between a child s early exposure to the toxic metal and antisocial behavior. Various studies have shown that lead exposure in children can contribute to cognitive impairment and behavioral problems including heightened aggression.  You can have all the armored personnel carriers you want in Ferguson said Terry but public safety is more likely to come from redressing environmental pollution poor education and unfair work.  Alexandra Natapoff Lee S. Kreindler Professor of Law sees policing as inexorably linked to the country s criminal justice system and its long ties to racism.  Policing does not stand alone or apart from how we charge people with crimes or how we convict them or how we treat them once they ve been convicted she said. That entire bundle of official practices is a central part of how we govern and in particular how we have historically governed Black people and other people of color and economically and socially disadvantaged populations.  Unpacking such a complicated issue requires voices from a variety of different backgrounds experiences and fields of expertise who can shine light on the problem and possible solutions said Natapoff who cofounded a new lecture series with HLS Professor Andrew Crespo titled Policing in America.  In recent weeks the pair have hosted Zoom discussions on topics ranging from qualified immunity to the Black Lives Matter movement to police unions to the broad contours of the American penal system. The series reflects the important work being done around the country said Natapoff and offers people the chance to further engage in dialogue over these over these rich complicated controversial issues around race and policing and governance and democracy.  Much of Natapoff s recent work emphasizes the hidden dangers of the nation s misdemeanor system. In her book Punishment Without Crime How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps the Innocent and Makes America More Unequal Natapoff shows how the practice of stopping arresting and charging people with lowlevel offenses often sends them down a devastating path.  This is how most people encounter the criminal apparatus and it s the first step of mass incarceration the initial net that sweeps people of color disproportionately into the criminal system said Natapoff. It is also the locus that overexposes Black people to police violence. The implications of this enormous net of police and prosecutorial authority around minor conduct is central to understanding many of the worst dysfunctions of our criminal system.  One consequence is that Black and brown people are incarcerated at much higher rates than white people. America has approximately 2.3 million people in federal state and local prisons and jails according to a 2020 report from the nonprofit the Prison Policy Initiative. According to a 2018 report from the Sentencing Project Black men are 5.9 times as likely to be incarcerated as white men and Hispanic men are 3.1 times as likely. Reducing mass incarceration requires shrinking the misdemeanor net along all of its axes said Natapoff who supports a range of reforms including training police officers to both confront and arrest people less for lowlevel offenses and the policies of forwardthinking prosecutors willing to charge fewer of those offenses when police do make arrests.  She praises the efforts of Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins in Massachusetts and George Gasc n the district attorney in Los Angeles County Calif. who have pledged to stop prosecuting a range of misdemeanor crimes such as resisting arrest loitering trespassing and drug possession. If cities and towns across the country committed to that kind of reform that would be a profoundly meaningful change said Natapoff and it would be a big step toward shrinking our entire criminal apparatus.  Retired U.S. Judge Nancy Gertner cites the need to reform federal sentencing guidelines arguing that all too often they have been proven to be biased and to result in packing the nation s jails and prisons. Another contributing factor in mass incarceration is sentencing disparities. A recent Harvard Law School study found that as is true nationally people of color are drastically overrepresented in Massachusetts state prisons. But the report also noted that Black and Latinx people were less likely to have their cases resolved through pretrial probation a way to dismiss charges if the accused meet certain conditions and receive much longer sentences than their white counterparts. Retired U.S. Judge Nancy Gertner also notes the need to reform federal sentencing guidelines arguing that all too often they have been proven to be biased and to result in packing the nation s jails and prisons. She points to the way the 1994 Crime Bill legislation sponsored by thenSen. Joe Biden of Delaware ushered in much harsher drug penalties for crack than for powder cocaine. This tied the hands of judges issuing sentences and disproportionately punished people of color in the process. The disparity in the treatment of crack and cocaine really was backed up by anecdote and stereotype not by data said Gertner a lecturer at HLS. There was no data suggesting that crack was infinitely more dangerous than cocaine. It was the young Black predator narrative.  The First Step Act a bipartisan prison reform bill aimed at reducing racial disparities in drug sentencing and signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 is just what its name implies said Gertner.  It reduces sentences to the merely inhumane rather than the grotesque. We still throw people in jail more than anybody else. We still resort to imprisonment rather than thinking of other alternatives. We still resort to punishment rather than other models. None of that has really changed. I don t deny the significance of somebody getting out of prison a year or two early but no one should think that that s reform.  Reform has long been a goal for federal leaders. Many heralded Obamaera changes aimed at eliminating racial disparities in policing and outlined in the report by The President s Task Force on 21st Century policing. But HKS s Smith saw them as largely symbolic. It s a nod to reform. But most of the reforms that are implemented in this country tend to be reforms that nibble around the edges and don t really make much of a difference.  Efforts such as diversifying police forces and implicit bias training do little to change behaviors and reduce violent conduct against people of color said Smith who cites studies suggesting a majority of Americans hold negative biases against Black and brown people and that unconscious prejudices and stereotypes are difficult to erase.  Experiments show that you can in the context of a day get people to think about race differently and maybe even behave differently. But if you follow up say a week or two weeks later those effects are gone. We don t know how to produce effects that are longlasting. We invest huge amounts to implement such police reforms but most often there s no empirical evidence to support their efficacy.  Even the early studies around the effectiveness of body cameras suggest the devices do little to change officers patterns of behavior said Smith though she cautions that researchers are still in the early stages of collecting and analyzing the data. And though police body cameras have caught officers in unjust violence much of the general public views the problem as anomalous.  Despite what many people in lowincome communities of color think about police officers the broader society has a lot of respect for police and thinks if you just get rid of the bad apples everything will be fine Smith added. The problem of course is this is not just an issue of bad apples.  Efforts such as diversifying police forces and implicit bias training do little to change behaviors and reduce violent conduct against people of color said Sandra Susan Smith a professor of criminal justice Harvard Kennedy School. Still Smith sees reason for hope and possible ways forward involving a range of communitybased approaches. As part of the effort to explore meaningful change Smith along with Christopher Winship DikerTishman Professor of Sociology at Harvard University and a member of the senior faculty at HKS have organized Reimagining Community Safety A Program in Criminal Justice Speaker Series to better understand the perspectives of practitioners policymakers community leaders activists and academics engaged in public safety reform. Some communitybased safety models have yielded important results. Smith singles out the Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets program known as CAHOOTS in Eugene Ore. which supplements police with a communitybased public safety program. When callers dial 911 they are often diverted to teams of workers trained in crisis resolution mental health and emergency medicine who are better equipped to handle nonlifethreatening situations. The numbers support her case. In 2017 the program received 25000 calls only 250 of which required police assistance. Training similar teams of specialists who don t carry weapons to handle all traffic stops could go a long way toward ending violent police encounters she said.  Imagine you have those kinds of services in play said Smith paired with communitybased antiviolence program such as Cure Violence which aims to stop violence in targeted neighborhoods by using approaches health experts take to control disease such as identifying and treating individuals and changing social norms. Together she said these programs could make a huge difference.  At Harvard Law School students have been studying how an alternate 911response team might function in Boston. We were trying to move from thinking about a 911response system as an opportunity to intervene in an acute moment to thinking about what it would look like to have a system that is trying to help reweave some of the threads of community a system that is more focused on healing than just on stopping harm said HLS Professor Rachel Viscomi who directs the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program and oversaw the research. The forthcoming report compiled by two students in the HLS clinic Billy Roberts and Anna Vande Velde will offer officials a range of ideas for how to think about community safety that builds on existing efforts in Boston and other cities said Viscomi. But Smith like others knows communitybased interventions are only part of the solution. She applauds the Justice Department s investigation into the Ferguson Police Department after the shooting of Brown. The 102page report shed light on the department s discriminatory policing practices including the ways police disproportionately targeted Black residents for tickets and fines to help balance the city s budget. To fix such entrenched problems state governments need to rethink their spending priorities and tax systems so they can provide cities and towns the financial support they need to remain debtfree said Smith. Rethinking the 911response system to being one that is more focused on healing than just on stopping harm is part of the studentled research under the direction of Law School Professor Rachel Viscomi who heads up the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program.  Part of the solution has to be a discussion about how government is funded and how a city like Ferguson got to a place where government had so few resources that they resorted to extortion of their residents in particular residents of color in order to make ends meet she said. We ve learned since that Ferguson is hardly the only municipality that has struggled with funding issues and sought to address them through the oppression and repression of their politically socially and economically marginalized Black and Latino residents.  Police contracts she said also need to be reexamined. The daughter of a union man Smith said she firmly supports officers rights to union representation to secure fair wages health care and safe working conditions. But the power unions hold to structure police contracts in ways that protect officers from being disciplined for illegal and unethical behavior needs to be challenged she said.  I think it s incredibly important for individuals to be held accountable and for those institutions in which they are embedded to hold them to account. But we routinely find that union contracts buffer individual officers from having to be accountable. We see this at the level of the Supreme Court as well whose rulings around qualified immunity have protected law enforcement from civil suits. That needs to change.  Other Harvard experts agree. In an opinion piece in The Boston Globe last June Tomiko BrownNagin dean of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute and the Daniel P.S. Paul Professor of Constitutional Law at HLS pointed out the Court s expansive interpretation of qualified immunity and called for reform that would promote accountability.   This nation is devoted to freedom to combating racial discrimination and to making government accountable to the people wrote BrownNagin. Legislators today like those who passed landmark Civil Rights legislation more than 50 years ago must take a stand for equal justice under law.
