https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/apr/13/democrats-abortion-voter-arizona-florida, Focus on reproductive rights has yielded big wins and Democrats hope threat of more Republican bans will mobilize voters That message is simple abortion bans happen when Republicans are in charge. The ruling from the Arizona supreme court arrived on Tuesday just days after a Florida supreme court ruling cleared the way for a sixweek abortion ban a decision that will cut off access to the procedure before many women even know they are pregnant. These backtoback rulings roiled the United States raising the already high stakes of the 2024 elections to towering new heights. Activists in both states are now at work on ballot measures that would ask voters to enshrine abortion rights in their states constitutions in November. Democrats are hopeful these efforts and the potential threat of more bans under a Trump administration will mobilize voters in their favor because abortion rights are popular among Americans and Republicans have spent years pushing restrictions. Democrats have made abortion rights a central issue of their campaigns in Arizona which was already expected to be a major battleground and Florida a longtime election bellwether that has swung further to the right in recent years. For Joe Biden who is struggling to generate enthusiasm among voters turning 2024 into a referendum on abortion may be his best shot at defeating Donald Trump. But it remains an open question whether the backlash to Roe s overturning will continue to drive voters in a presidential election year when they may be more swayed by concern over the economy and immigration.  In public polls that might just ask What s your most important issue? You re going to see abortion in the middle maybe even towards the bottom said Tresa Undem a cofounder of the polling firm PerryUndem who has studied public opinion on abortion for two decades. But when you talk to core groups that Democrats need to turn out it s front and center.  A recent Wall Street Journal poll found that Trump held doubledigit leads when swing state voters were asked who would best handle the economy inflation and immigration but they trusted Biden more on abortion. A Fox News poll in March found that most voters in Arizona believe Biden will do a better job handling the issue of abortion but it was less of a priority than the economy election integrity and foreign policy. The Biden campaign has released two abortionfocused ads this week including one that features a Texas woman who was denied an abortion after her water broke too early in pregnancy. She ended up in the ICU. Indivisible a national grassroots organization with a local presence in states across the country said volunteer signups to knock on doors in Arizona spiked 50 following the state supreme court s ruling. Its members in Arizona are helping to organize rallies in support of reproductive rights as well as events to collect signatures for the ballot measure. When Roe fell abortion rights grip on voters was far from guaranteed. Mitch McConnell Senate Republicans longtime leader and an architect of the conservative supreme court majority that overturned Roe brushed off outrage over its demise as a wash in federal elections. Although most Americans support some degree of access to the procedure antiabortion voters were more likely to say the issue was important to their vote than proabortion rights voters. The fall of Roe changed that. Anger over Roe was credited with halting Republicans muchpromised red wave in the 2022 midterm elections while proabortion rights ballot measures triumphed even in crimson states such as Kansas and Kentucky. Last year when Virginia Republicans tried retake control of the state legislature by championing a compromise 15 weekban they failed. Democrats now control both chambers in the state.  When Republicans offer compromises I think a lot of voters are inclined not to see those as what the Republican party really wants longterm but what the Republican party thinks is necessary to settle for in the short term said Mary Ziegler a University of California at Davis School of Law professor who studies the legal history of reproduction. They know that Republicans are aligned with the prolife movement and the prolife movement wants fetal personhood and a ban at fertilization.  In the hours after the Arizona decision several Republican state lawmakers and candidates with long records of opposing abortion rushed to denounce the neartotal ban which has not yet taken effect. The Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake who once called abortion the ultimate sin and said Arizona s impending neartotal abortion ban was a great law attempted to clarify her position on the issue in a meandering fiveminuteplus video. The ban she once favored which passed in 1864 before Arizona even became a state or women gained the right to vote is now out of line with where the people of this state are Lake said.  The issue is less about banning abortion and more about saving babies she said as instrumental music swelled against images of pregnant women and pregnancy tests. She repeatedly stressed the importance of choice language associated with people who support abortion rights while simultaneously invoking the value of life . Lake also emphasized that she agrees with President Trump on abortion. Over the course of his campaign Trump has alternated between taking credit for overturning Roe since he appointed three of the justices who ruled to do so toying with the idea of a national ban and insisting that states can decide their own abortion laws as he did in a video this week.  He s simply trying to have it I think both ways Ziegler said of Trump. Come November Democrats are counting on the realworld consequences of the bans overriding other concerns. The economy is still important. Immigration is still important but this is immediate said Stacy Pearson an Arizonabased Democratic strategist.  A woman just wants to be in her OBGYN s office having a conversation with her doctor about her medical care without concerns about whether or not old white men in cowboy hats were right in 1864 Pearson added. It s nuts.

Andrew HarnikGetty Images hide caption   Former President Donald Trump speaks at a rally outside Schnecksville Fire Hall in Schnecksville Pennsylvania. Trump will forever be known as the president who appointed the justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade in June of 2022. But the former president hasnt always been against abortion rights. In 1999 when he was considering a run for the White House Trump told NBCs Tim Russert on Meet the Press Im very prochoice. I hate the concept of abortion. I hate it I hate everything it stands for. I cringe when people debate the subject. But I still believe in choice. By 2011 Trump had changed his position. Once again he was considering a run for president and Trump described himself as prolife when speaking to the Conservative Political Action Conference or CPAC. Their candidate delivered. Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices during his term which ultimately led to the overturning of Roe v. Wade.  Some Republicans in Congress are pushing for a federal ban on abortion with many in the Republican base pressuring Trump to voice his support. Last week Trump posted a video on Truth Social that supported leaving abortion access up to the states My view is that now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint. The states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both and whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case the law of the state. By saying he will instead leave the issue to the states essentially the status quo Trump appears to be trying to avoid strengthening Democrats ability to rally their voters around abortion rights.  Supporting a national abortion ban is a position that some Republicans like Chris Christie and Nikki Haley have said was unwise or at least impractical.  This election year Trumps position on abortion could influence whether he wins or loses the race. But if he is elected antiabortion activists will likely push Trump to use the power of the executive branch to restrict abortion access.

Senator Lindsey Graham RSC was the first. In the fall of 2022 just months after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade he proposed legislation calling for a national abortion ban after 15 weeks. So far this bill has gone nowhere. Then in 2023 gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin of Virginia put the 15week abortion ban at the center of his campaign to help the GOP take full control of the Virginia legislature. Rather than holding one house and picking up the other he lost both. Recently former President Donald Trump who often brags about appointing the three Supreme Court justices who made possible the repeal of Roe v. Wade offered his own way out of the thicket by applauding the fact that states now can decide the issue for themselves. And in Arizona the Republican Senate candidate Kari Lake is trying to rally the party around the notion of a 15week ban instead of the 1864 near total ban their court just affirmed even though she s facing criticism for this on the far right. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal came out with a poll showing that abortion was the number one issue by far for suburban women voters in swing states. In each instance and there will be more we find Republicans desperately trying to find a position on the issue that makes their base and the other parts of their coalition happy. It doesn t exist and here s why abortion is an integral part of health care for women. Since 2022 when the Supreme Court eviscerated Roe in the Dobbs case we have been undergoing a reluctant national seminar in obstetrics and gynecology. All over the country legislators mostly male are discovering that pregnancy is not simple. Pregnancies go wrong for many reasons and when they do the fetus needs to be removed. One of the first to discover this reality was Republican State Representative Neal Collins of South Carolina. He was brought to tears by the story of a South Carolina woman whose water broke just after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Obstetrics lesson 1 a fetus can t live after the water breaks. But lawyers advised doctors that they could not remove the fetus despite that being the recommended medical course of action. And so the woman was sent home to miscarry on her own putting her at risk of losing her uterus andor getting blood poisoning. A woman from Austin Texas had a similar story one that eventually made its way into a heartwrenching ad by the Biden campaign. Amanda Zurawski was 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke. Rather than remove the fetus doctors in Texas sent her home where she miscarried and developed blood poisoning sepsis so severe that she may never get pregnant again. Note that in both cases the medical emergency happened after 15 weeks late miscarriages are more likely to have serious medical effects than early ones. The 15week idea popular among Republicans seeking a way out of their quagmire doesn t conform to medical reality. Over in Arkansas a Republican state representative learned that his niece was carrying a fetus who lacked a vital organ meaning that it would never develop normally and either die in utero or right after birth. Obstetrics lesson 2 severe fetal abnormalities happen. He changed his position on the Arkansas law saying Who are we to sit in judgment of these women making a decision between them and their physician and their God above?  In a case that gained national attention Kate Cox a Texas mother of two was pregnant with her third child when the fetus was diagnosed with a rare condition called Trisomy 18 which usually ends in miscarriage or in the immediate death of the baby. Continuing this doomed pregnancy put Cox at risk of uterine rupture and would make it difficult to carry another child. Obstetrics lesson 3 continuing to carry a doomed pregnancy can jeopardize future pregnancies. And yet the Texas Attorney General blocked an abortion for Cox and threatened to prosecute anyone who took care of her and the Texas Supreme Court ruled that her condition did not meet the statutory exception for lifethreatening physical condition.  So she and her husband eventually went to New Mexico for the abortion. Obstetrics lesson 4 miscarriages are very common affecting approximately 30 of pregnancies. While many pass without much drama and women heal on their own others cause complications that require what s known as a D C for dilation and curettage. This involves scraping bits of pregnancy tissue out of the uterus to avoid infection. When Christina Zielke of Maryland was told that her fetus had no heartbeat she opted to wait to miscarry naturally. While waiting she and her husband traveled to Ohio for a wedding where she began to bleed so heavily that they had to go to an emergency room. A D C would have stopped the bleeding but in Ohio doctors worried that they would be criminally charged under the new abortion laws and sent her home in spite of the fact that she was still bleeding heavily and in spite of the fact that doctors in Maryland had confirmed that her fetus had no heartbeat. Eventually her blood pressure dropped and she passed out from loss of blood and returned to the hospital where a D C finally stopped the bleeding. These are but a few of the horror stories that will continue to mount in states with partial or total bans on abortion. As these stories accumulate the issue will continue to have political punch. We have already seen the victory of prochoice referenda in deep red conservative states like Kansas Kentucky Montana and Ohio and in swing states like Michigan and in deep blue states like California and Vermont. In an era where almost everything is viewed through a partisan lens abortion rights transcend partisanship. And more referenda are coming in November. The expectation is that at least some if not most of the prochoice voters likely to be mobilized by the abortion issue will help Democrats up and down the ballot. As a result Democratic campaigns are working hard to make sure the public knows that Republicans are responsible. The following table shows the states that are likely to have referenda in November. States where the referenda are already on the ballot are at the end of the table. Once the deadline occurs for filing signatures a battle will take place in each state as prolife groups seek to challenge enough signatures to keep the referenda from getting on the ballot which is why prochoice groups are gathering many more signatures than needed. Ever since the Supreme Court decided the Dobbs case analysts have underestimated the size of the prochoice vote. In hindsight there s no question that it was instrumental in blocking the expected red wave in the 2022 midterms and instrumental in putting both houses of the Virginia legislature in Democratic hands in 2023. Biden s first abortion ads will no doubt be followed by others and Republicans will try to come up with ways of softening their stances but in the end this could be the most decisive issue in the election.

AP PhotoRebecca Blackwell NEW YORK AP Former President Donald Trump said Monday he believes abortion limits should be left to the states outlining his position in a video in which he declined to endorse a national ban after months of mixed messages and speculation.  Many people have asked me what my position is on abortion and abortion rights Trump said in the video posted on his Truth Social site. My view is now that we have abortion where everybody wanted it from a legal standpoint the states will determine by vote or legislation or perhaps both. And whatever they decide must be the law of the land in this case the law of the state.  Trump in the video did not say when in pregnancy he believes abortion should be banned declining to endorse a national cutoff that would have been used as a cudgel by Democrats ahead of the November election. But his endorsement of the patchwork approach leaves him open to being attached to the strictest proposed state legislation which President Joe Biden and his reelection campaign have already been working to do. Antiabortion activists expressed keen disappointment that Trump didn t go further. In the video he again took credit for the U.S. Supreme Court s decision to end Roe v. Wade saying that he was proudly the person responsible for the ending of the constitutional right to an abortion and thanking the conservative justices who overturned it by name.  Biden promotes lifechanging student loan relief in Wisconsin as he rallies younger voters Abortion rights across the US vary by state Trump s campaign said it raised a record 50.5 million at a Florida fundraiser  While he again articulated his support for three exceptions in cases of rape incest and when the life of the mother is at risk he went on to describe the current legal landscape in which different states have different restrictions following the court s Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization ruling on June 24 2022 which upended the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision.  Many states will be different. Many will have a different number of weeks or some will have more conservative than others and that s what they will be he said. At the end of the day it s all about will of the people.  Trump had long argued that the Supreme Court s decision gave those who oppose abortion rights tremendous power to negotiate leverage he said he wanted to use to strike a deal that he hoped would make both sides happy and bring the country together even though the issue is one of the most contentious in American politics with some opponents viewing abortion as murder and proponents seeing it as a fundamental women s right. The announcement drew immediate condemnation from SBA ProLife America one of the country s most prominent groups opposed to abortion rights.  We are deeply disappointed in President Trump s position said the group s president Marjorie Dannenfelser in a statement. Unborn children and their mothers deserve national protections and national advocacy from the brutality of the abortion industry. The Dobbs decision clearly allows both states and Congress to act.  Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina one of Trump s congressional backers and supporter of a 15week national ban said he respectfully disagreed with Trump over abortion being an issue for the states. Mike Pence a staunch abortion opponent who served as Trump s vice president challenged him for this year s GOP nomination and has said he won t endorse him on X called the stance a slap in the face to the millions of prolife Americans who have previously backed Trump. Trump took to Truth Social later Monday to lash out at his critics saying both Dannenfelser and Graham were of absolutely no help as the Democrats staged rallies and won Elections they should never have won after Dobbs adding that Graham should focus instead on the millions of people dying in senseless neverending Wars that he constantly favors and promotes.  Biden s campaign was quick to seize on the moment with spokesperson Ammar Moussa posting on X that Trump was endorsing every single abortion ban in the states including abortion bans with no exceptions ... and he s bragging about his role in creating this hellscape.  In a statement Biden said Trump has played a part in being responsible for creating the cruelty and the chaos that has enveloped America since the Dobbs decision a situation he said is reflected in women being turned away from emergency rooms forced to go to court to seek permission for the medical attention they need and left to travel hundreds of miles for health care.   Trump s in trouble and he knows it Biden said at a fundraiser in Chicago on Monday. In a statement Jenny Lawson executive director of Planned Parenthood Votes expressed confidence that the voters who clearly rejected antiabortion politics in other postDobbs elections will do the same with Donald Trump and his cronies in 2024.  In a Biden campaign call with reporters Texas mother Kaitlyn Kash described her need to obtain outofstate care after losing one pregnancy then her difficulty in receiving a dilation and curettage procedure after another successful delivery following the Dobbs decision situations she laid at Trump s feet.   What I went through didn t need to happen but it did because of Donald Trump Kash said. Biden s campaign also went up with an ad featuring Amanda Zurawski a Texas woman they said nearly died twice after she was denied care for a miscarriage because of the state s abortion ban a ban that was only possible because Donald Trump overturned Roe v. Wade.  Trump had suggested last month in a radio interview that he was leaning toward supporting a national abortion ban at around 15 weeks of pregnancy but at the same time seemed reluctant to embrace a federal prohibition. Republicanled states have ushered in a wave of new restrictions following the 2022 overturning of Roe v. Wade. More than a dozen GOPcontrolled states have banned abortion outright while others have outlawed the procedure on increasingly diminishing timelines.  Other reproductiverelated procedures have faced restrictions including in vitro fertilization which quickly became a campaign flashpoint after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled this year that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Trump said he strongly supports IVF availability. Alabama lawmakers and Republican Gov. Kay Ivey agreed to protect IVF providers from legal liability. Democrats believe the fight over abortion rights helps them at the polls and have outperformed expectations in elections since. Voters in seven states have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures and abortion is expected to be on the ballot in more states this year including Florida Maryland and New York. Trump has tried to thread the needle on abortion throughout the campaign calling himself the most prolife president in American history but also blaming GOP candidates who did not allow for exceptions for the party s 2022 losses. In the video Trump told Republicans that they must follow your heart on this issue. But remember you must also win elections to restore our culture and in fact to save our country which is currently and very sadly a nation in decline.  Instead he has tried to paint Democrats as the radical ones on this position.  Democrats and Biden s campaign meanwhile have been spotlighting the issue as they work to draw a contrast with Trump. Polling has consistently shown that most Americans believe abortion should be legal through the initial stages of pregnancy. About half of U.S. adults said abortions should be permitted at the 15week mark according to an Associated PressNORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll conducted last June. Data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the vast majority of abortions from 2012 to 2021 were performed within the first 13 weeks of pregnancy.  ___ Kinnard reported from Columbia South Carolina. Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York and Darlene Superville in Chicago contributed to this report.
https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/elections/2024/04/01/abortion-rights-on-2024-florida-ballot-after-supreme-court-ruling/73052907007/, The 43 ruling ensures abortion will be on voter s minds when casting ballots in November. The men on the court Chief Justice Carlos Muniz and Justices Charles Canady John Couriel and Jorge Labarga were in the majority and the women Justices Renatha Francis Jamie Grosshans and Meredith Sasso dissented. The ballot summary states No law shall prohibit penalize delay or restrict abortion before viability or when necessary to protect the patients health as determined by the patients healthcare provider.  There is no lack of candor or accuracy the ballot language plainly informs voters that the material legal effects of the proposed amendment will be that the government will be unable to enact laws that prohibit penalize delay or restrict previability abortions or abortions necessary to protect the mother s health wrote the majority. Floridians Protecting Freedom began to campaign for the amendment in May after Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the sixweek ban in an unannounced latenight ceremony in advance of a shortlived presidential campaign. Before he suspended his presidential campaign DeSantis chided prolife supporters for not aggressively challenging abortionrights initiatives in their states.  Julia Friedland DeSantis deputy press secretary said in a statement We agree with the three women on the court who got it right in dissent. This amendment is misleading and will confuse voters. The language hides the amendments true purpose of mandating that abortions be permitted up to the time of birth. Animating the majority s decision today is the constitutional principle that all political power is inherent in the people said a concurring opinion signed by Canady and Couriel. A judge s obedience to that principle does not signal personal indifference to the objective justice of a proposition. The ruling also represents a setback for the Republican establishment in advance of the 2024 election. DeSantis appointed five of the current seven justices on the Florida high court. They rejected Attorney General Ashley Moodys assertion that the failure to define terms such as viability and healthcare provider in the ballot summary would mislead voters. That failure could hoodwink voters into inserting unlimited access to abortion into the constitution Deputy Solicitor General Nathan Forrester told the justices in oral argument this February. Without definitions viability and healthcare provider become ticking timebombs in the constitution that proponents could activate to argue that the amendment has a much broader meaning than voters would ever have thought explained Forrester. Francis and Sasso accepted Forresters argument. In dissent they wrote that the ballot summary misleads by omission and fails to convey the breadth of what the amendment actually accomplishes. Arguments over the amendments intent said Francis and Sasso will lead to decades of court fights. A voter may think this amendment simply returns Florida to a preDobbs status quo. It does not. ... And critically the voter may think this amendment results in settling this issue once and for all. It does not Francis and Sasso wrote. The majority however accepted the backers explaination they followed guidelines the court had previously laid out for when viability is the appropriate term in an abortion initiative.  And Couriel told the opponents that even if the proposal came as a wolf in sheep s clothing about to attack abortion regulations the question is is this hiding the ball?  Courtney Brewer the lawyer for Floridians Protecting Freedom told the court the words in question are commonly understood in an abortion context.  Muniz then wondered if Couriel had asked the right question. He asked if the court could decide the legality of the abortionrights amendment without considering the impact it will have on the natural persons provision of the Constitution.  The amendment kind of assumes that the Constitution as it exists right now is silent as to any rights of the unborn. And I don t know if that assumption is correct Muniz said.  Neither the state nor the other opponents had addressed the issue in their briefs and arguments.  There is no basis for concluding that the proposed amendment is facially invalid under the United States Constitution. Accordingly we approve the proposed amendment for placement on the ballot the court ruled.  Floridians Protecting Freedom Backed by the ACLU Planned Parenthood philanthropists and retirees raised 15 million to gather 996512 signatures in fewer than eight months to qualify for Supreme Court review and clearance for the 2024 statewide ballot.  At the same time the justices also handed abortion opponents a big victory.
https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/biden-preps-event-tying-floridas-six-week-abortion-ban-2024-campaign-rcna148595, At the event which is scheduled to take place in Tampa about one week before the state law is set to go into effect the president will talk about the stakes of this election for reproductive freedom across the entire country.  Biden will also tie Florida s restrictions on the procedure to other consequences of Roe v. Wade being overturned in 2022 including the Arizona state Supreme Court decision last week that upheld a neartotal abortion ban dating from 1864 according to the aides.  From Arizona to Florida more and more Americans are seeing up close the devastating impact of Trump overturning Roe v. Wade Morgan Mohr senior adviser for reproductive rights for the BidenHarris campaign said in a statement. While Donald Trump continues to brag about unleashing these extreme and dangerous bans President Joe Biden is running to restore reproductive freedom. Since the overturning of Roe whenever reproductive rights have been on the ballot they have won and this November will be no different.  The event is significant for Biden While voicing full support for abortion access he has often looked to Vice President Kamala Harris to be the administration s most prominent voice on the issue. Since the Supreme Courts Dobbs decision overturned the federal right to abortion in June 2022 Harris has held more than 80 events across 20 states focused on reproductive freedom including delivering a speech last week in Arizona criticizing the ban in that state and tying in former President Donald Trump s role in allowing abortion restrictions to take place. On Tuesday though Biden will take center stage on the issue. The president is expected to attack Trump for saying he is proud of appointing the Supreme Court justices who made overturning Roe v. Wade possible as well as for other comments related to recently enacted state abortion bans. Biden is also expected to say that if reelected Trump and his allies will enact a federal abortion ban though Trump has recently claimed that he would not do so saying instead that he wanted the issue left to the states. Meanwhile the BidenHarris campaign has been hammering Republicans as more and more states restrict abortion. The campaign has rolled out emotional ads focused on the issue and has used women affected by the abortion restrictions as campaign surrogates across the country. Biden s trip to Tampa is part of the campaign s broader effort to nationalize the fallout and the conversation around state abortion bans. The campaign sees Florida s abortion ban as especially salient because once in effect the sixweek ban will affect the entire Southeast given that many women in states with stricter abortion bans have traveled to Florida to get abortions.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/04/23/biden-abortion-florida-trump/,  There s one person who is responsible for this nightmare and he s acknowledged and he s bragged about it Biden told a crowd of several hundred at Hillsborough Community College. It s Donald Trump.  Repeatedly bashing Trump by name Biden took his message on reproductive freedom to a state where Democrats have lost ground in recent years but where they believe the abortion issue will galvanize voters. In his first major speech on abortion since Trump said the politically volatile question should be left to the states Biden suggested he would return to the issue in the months ahead. Biden and other Democrats have sought to remind voters that Trump appointed three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade paving the way for strict abortion bans in many states. Biden s speech Tuesday was part of a broader Democratic effort to turn the 2022 Supreme Court decision into a rallying cry for the 2024 election.  Donald Trump is worried voters are going to hold him accountable for the cruelty and chaos he created Biden said. Folks the bad news for Trump is we are going to hold him accountable.  Democrats who have seen the abortion issue mobilize voters in ways that have delivered victories in deeply Republican states such as Kentucky Kansas and Ohio are pushing to elevate the issue in other conservativeleaning states in hopes of putting Trump and his fellow Republicans on defense. This month the Florida Supreme Court approved a state law that would restrict most abortions after the sixth week of pregnancy. Biden called the law bizarre but suggested that women would turn out in droves in November to restore those rights for the women of America.   This isn t about states rights. It s about women s rights he said. Trump who previously suggested the law signed by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis R was harsh made his own abortion policy shift April 8 saying the issue should be left to the states. But the Arizona Supreme Court ruled the next day that an 1864 law outlawing nearly all abortions should take effect prompting immediate criticism from Trump and some other Republicans. The Arizona and Florida rulings and Trump s latest posturing on the issue have triggered a steppedup effort by Democrats to blame the former president for the state of reproductive health care across the country.  In Arizona did you see what happened when you left it to the states? Rep. Kathy Castor DFla. said at Biden s event referring to the reversion to the 1864 law. It s cruel and it s wrong. And in Florida Governor DeSantis and the extremists in the Florida legislature are taking us backward as well.  Florida voters will have an opportunity to weigh in on the state s law. The state Supreme Court allowed a measure that would enshrine abortion rights in the state s constitution to appear on the ballot in November. Like other such constitutional measures in Florida the referendum would need to achieve 60 percent of the vote to pass. Trump a Florida resident has not said how he would vote on the measure. Democrats are hoping the ballot issue will increase turnout and make Florida a state Trump won by 3.3 percentage points in 2020 more competitive at least for downballot races if not for the presidency said Susan MacManus a political analyst based in the Tampa area.  It can t just be about Biden running for president. It has got to also be about Democrats running for congressional and state legislative positions she said adding that while Biden receives low marks from young voters in the state the abortion ballot measure could help him win additional votes from that key voting bloc. Trump and his Republican allies have sought to cast Biden and his allies as the real extremists on the issue accusing Democrats of supporting latestage abortions. But Biden a practicing Catholic has at times struggled to balance his personal beliefs and politics in public remarks about abortion. During a fundraiser last year he said I m not big on abortion.  Ata meeting of his top officials at the White House in January Biden made sure to stipulate that he was not pushing for abortion on demand but rather federal policy that would codify the protections that the Supreme Court justices outlined in their 1973 Roe decision. In his State of the Union address last month Biden did not utter the word abortion instead skipping over the term in his prepared remarks and opting for alternative language such as reproductive freedom and the right to choose.  Florida which has trended decidedly toward Republicans in recent years after decades of being the nation s largest swing state has been a destination for people seeking abortions in part because it is surrounded by several states with strict bans on the procedure. In the months since Roe was overturned many women in the South have traveled to Florida to receive abortions fleeing restrictions in states like Alabama and South Carolina. More than 80000 women get an abortion in Florida in a typical year accounting for about 1 in 12 abortions in the country. When Florida s new restriction goes into place May 1 the closest option for someone seeking an abortion may be North Carolina. In Tampa Biden even attacked Trump for selling a 60 Bible.  How many times does he have to prove he can t be trusted? Biden asked adding that the former president described the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe as a miracle.   Maybe it s coming from that Bible he s trying to sell Biden said. I almost wanted to buy one just to see what the hell is in it.  Caroline Kitchener and Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.
https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2024/04/politics/abortion-rights-republican-2024-election-dg/index.html, On social media in public comments and in talking points on their websites candidates are shying away from past hardline positions and softening their stances. In some cases the changes have been overt with candidates reversing course on supporting outright bans on abortion or even denying they ever opposed it.  But in others the shift has been more subtle and nuanced with candidates altering or deleting previous statements or deemphasizing stances that had been more central to their platform just a few years ago.  CNN s KFile examined more than a dozen competitive races at various levels and found examples of Republicans shifting or downplaying their positions on abortion following the Supreme Court s landmark 2022 Dobbs decision that overturned a nationwide right for women to have an abortion.  Since that decision voters have affirmed abortion rights in every state that has put the issue on the ballot. The 2022 midterm elections also saw a number of antiabortion Republicans lose dissolving GOP hopes for a red wave that year.  Ahead of this year s election some of those losing candidates are trying to rebrand themselves by moderating their positions on abortion. Others including some incumbents are avoiding the issue entirely as antiabortion rhetoric and policies are seen as politically toxic.  Donald Trump the presumptive Republican presidential nominee announced on Monday that abortion rights should be left to the states effectively punting on Republican calls for a federal abortion ban in what appears to be an effort to neutralize the politically fraught issue for his party up and down the ticket in November. Trump himself has shifted on abortion repeatedly over the past 25 years.  Also this week the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the state must adhere to a 160yearold law banning nearly all abortions with exceptions only to save the life of the mother further complicating things for a handful of Republican candidates in the state who have previously expressed antiabortion stances.  A CNN analysis found that a majority of candidates who have moderated their stances on abortion hail from states where the procedure remains legal a reflection of the popular opinion in their states toward the issue and the challenging current politics of abortion. States where Republican candidates have changed or downplayed past stances Here is a look at how those stances have changed by candidate Kari Lake a former news anchor who lost her bid for Arizona governor in 2022 said in an interview that year that she was prolife 1000.   This push to brainwash our children an entire generation of young people to think that the execution the sacrifice the killing of a baby in the mother s womb is in any way health care is just outrageous she said in June 2022.  Following the Dobbs decision Lake also said that she was thrilled at the prospect of an arcane law from when the state was still a territory taking effect. The law known as 133603 effectively bans all abortions with no exceptions for rape or incest and makes it punishable to help a woman obtain an abortion by up to five years in state prison.   I m incredibly thrilled that we are going to have a great law that s already on the books Lake said on a conservative radio show in 2022. I believe it s ARS 133603 so it will prohibit abortion in Arizona except to save the life of a mother. And I think we re going to be paving the way and setting course for other states to follow.  This still from video shows Kari Lake explaining her antiabortion stance in 2022. From Right Side Broadcasting NetworkYouTubeOn Tuesday the Arizona Supreme Court ruled that the state must adhere to that law barring all abortions except to save the life of the mother.  Afterward Lake said in a statement I oppose today s ruling and I am calling on Arizona Democratic Gov. Katie Hobbs and the State Legislature to come up with an immediate common sense solution that Arizonans can support. Ultimately Arizona voters will make the decision on the ballot come November.   I am incredibly thrilled at 1864 law banning nearly all abortions in Arizona. Source SoundCloud  I oppose today s ruling from the Arizona Supreme Court upholding the 1864 law banning nearly all abortions. Source CNN The law has not gone into effect yet abortion is currently legal for up to 15 weeks in Arizona.  Now as the likely Republican nominee for Senate from Arizona Lake says she recognizes that abortion is decided by the states. She also said last month that Arizona s 15week limit is a good law.  A campaign spokesperson told CNN Kari Lake is personally prolife. Her position on a federal abortion ban is clear she opposes it. Just like President Trump Kari is opposed to the territorial law and is calling on the State Legislature to fix the issue. Her focus is on saving babies and helping women through protecting IVF baby bonuses child tax credits and paid family leave.  As a congressman in 2010 Michigan Republican Mike Rogers said he supported abortion under only one circumstance.   I believe abortions should be legal only to prevent the death of the mother he said in a local interview. While serving in the US House before Roe v. Wade was overturned Rogers consistently voted for 20week abortion bans.  But in September 2023 as a candidate for US Senate Rogers pledged not to support federal laws limiting abortion if they contradict Michigan s law. Abortion is currently legal in Michigan up to 24 weeks for adults.   I believe abortions should be legal only to prevent the death of the mother.  Source MLive Pledges not to support any federal law that contradicts Michigan s 24week law. Source Detroit News In response to a request for comment from CNN Rogers said in a statement The people of Michigan spoke in a loud voice in 2022 and this is a settled issue in our state. I will take no position as their voice in Washington that is at odds with the Michigan Constitution.  A dozen years ago businessman Eric Hovde launched a campaign for US Senate from Wisconsin in which he said he was totally opposed to abortion. Hovde a wealthy businessman lost that 2012 race in the Republican primary.  After he announced his campaign for Senate in February Hovde said that his stance on abortion included exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother and that abortion policy should be left to state voters.  A Hovde spokesperson told CNN Eric Hovde has always supported exceptions in the cases of rape incest or harm to the mother.   His position is as follows 1 Issue should be decided at the state level via referendum 2 Exceptions for rape incest life of the mother 3 There should be a period of time at the beginning of a pregnancy for a woman to make a decision.  A former hedge fund manager and Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration Dave McCormick ran for the 2022 Republican nomination for US Senate from Pennsylvania eventually losing to Mehmet Oz who in turn lost to Democrat John Fetterman in the general election.  When asked directly at a candidate forum in April 2022 two months before the Supreme Court s Dobbs decision whether he supported exceptions for abortion McCormick answered I believe in the very rare instances there should be exceptions for the life of the mother. On his campaign website at the time he wrote that he is staunchly prolife and believes that life begins at conception.  Following that candidate forum it was widely reported by national and local media outlets that McCormick supported only exceptions for the life of the mother in very rare instances.  Now running for Pennsylvania s other Senate seat McCormick says he supports exceptions in the cases of rape incest and health of the mother.  A spokesperson for the McCormick campaign said in a statement to CNN Dave recognizes that this is an incredibly polarizing issue and we need to seek policies that unify the country. Dave is prolife is opposed to a national abortion ban and supports exceptions in the cases of rape incest and saving the life of the mother. In Pennsylvania the current law supported by both Republicans and Democrats means abortion is legal through 24 weeks.  The McCormick campaign also provided CNN audio from what they say is a February 2022 event in which McCormick expressed support for exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother. The campaign also pointed to a flyer from an unaffiliated PAC sent in May 2022 that indicated McCormick supported exceptions in the case of rape and incest.  CNN asked the campaign to explain why McCormick described his position the way he did in April 2022 when he said he supported abortion only in cases in which the life of the mother was at risk. The campaign responded Dave s debate answer was incomplete as he inadvertently left out the other two exceptions. As you can see from his other statements immediately before and after that debate he s always supported all three.  A retired Army captain who was severely burned while deployed to Afghanistan Sam Brown s position has shifted since he first ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the Texas Legislature in 2014. During a candidate forum in January 2014 Brown said he supported a 2013 Texas abortion bill introduced by Republicans banning abortion at 20 weeks which did not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.   On issues of life that is a nonnegotiable for me. We ve got to do everything we can to empower our state make sure that it stays on the books Brown said referring to the 2013 bill which ultimately passed.  This still from video shows Sam Brown explaining his antiabortion stance in 2014. From Michael OpenshawYouTubeDuring an ultimately unsuccessful bid for US Senate in Nevada in 2022 Brown answered a questionnaire in which he listed the only circumstance for abortion he supported would be risk of life to the mother. The campaign has since disavowed the survey claiming in a statement to the Nevada Independent that Brown did not authorize the answer. Most recently Brown s wife Army veteran Amy Brown said she got an abortion at 24 when she was fiveandahalf weeks pregnant just before she met her current husband. Sam Brown now a candidate for Nevada s other Senate seat told NBC News that he embraced the state s 24week abortion ban and does not support a national ban on abortion calling it a state s issue. He said that while he is prolife he supports exceptions for rape incest and the life and health of a mother.  In response to a request for comment from CNN Brown said in a statement Amy and I have spoken extensively about this topic and believe first and foremost that mothers who are facing an unplanned pregnancy deserve the utmost compassion and understanding. I am prolife with exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother. Like President Trump I believe the issue is now correctly left at the state level and applaud his leadership.  Mark Robinson North Carolina s lieutenant governor and the Republican nominee for governor this year has repeatedly backed a complete ban on abortion without exceptions.   For me there is no compromise on abortion. It makes no difference to me why or how that child ended up in that womb he said in July 2020 while campaigning for lieutenant governor.  This still from video shows Mark Robinson explaining his antiabortion stance in July 2020. From Winkler s Grove Baptist ChurchYouTubeNow Robinson denies that he wanted to ban abortions without exceptions and as CNN s KFile previously reported Robinson now avoids using the aword. He has also admitted that he once paid for an abortion for his thengirlfriend nowwife in the 1980s an experience he says he fully regrets.  In response to CNN s request for comment a spokesperson for the campaign said in a statement Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson is prolife because of the painful and difficult experience he and his wife had and his faith. He s said that as governor he would sign a socalled heartbeat bill with exceptions for rape incest and when the life of the mother is in danger. Lt. Gov. Robinson also wants to turn North Carolina into a destination state for life by doing more to support women that choose life like improving our fostercare and adoption systems and preserving access to IVF.

Now Schweikert s website makes no mention of abortion at all.

I do not support today s ruling from the AZ Supreme Court. This issue should be decided by Arizonans not legislated from the bench. I encourage the state legislature to address this issue immediately he wrote on X the platform formerly known as Twitter.  His campaign did not respond to CNN s requests for comment about his current views on abortion.  US Rep. Michelle Steel a twoterm whose Southern California district would have backed Joe Biden under its current lines cosponsored the Life at Conception Act a bill colloquially known as a personhood law that would recognize a fertilized egg as a person with equal protections under the 14th Amendment. The bill would effectively ban abortion in all cases and would threaten in vitro fertilization.  But after facing backlash from voters following an Alabama Supreme Court ruling that reproductive rights advocates said could have a chilling effect on IVF Steel rescinded her support for the bill because she does not support federal restrictions on IVF.  A spokesperson for Steel s campaign pointed to an oped she wrote in March 2024 outlining her beliefs. I believe life begins at conception. I am prolife with exceptions for rape incest and the health and life of the mother she wrote. I believe nothing is more prolife than helping families have children and I do not support federal restrictions on IVF. Which is why when a recent court ruling in Alabama raised questions as to whether the Life at Conception Act if passed would ban IVF I removed myself from that bill to not create confusion about my support of IVF.  US Rep. Zach Nunn a former Iowa state legislator and Air Force veteran made waves at a GOP primary debate in May 2022 when he raised his hand twice when asked if he supported a complete ban on abortion with no exceptions.  Following the Dobbs decision Nunn later said that he believed in some exceptions for abortion including the health of the mother citing Iowa s heartbeat bill that would ban abortion at about 6 weeks but includes exceptions for rape and incest. He wrote in an oped in August 2022 I wholeheartedly support the sanctity of life and believe that life begins with conception but I also understand that there are realworld scenarios that aren t blackandwhite.  In a statement to CNN Nunn said Good people can disagree on the issue of abortion. Here s where I ve always stood I m prolife voted for exceptions expanded access to contraceptives and access to IVF. I oppose a federal ban and believe abortion policy is up to the states. In Congress I m fighting back against extremes in both parties and working to bring real solutions for Iowa families.  Joe Kent a retired US Army Green Beret and Gold Star spouse whose wife was killed in a 2019 bombing in Syria previously ran for this seat in 2022 on a farright platform but lost in the general election to Democrat Marie Gluesenkamp Perez. The district would have backed Trump under its current lines by 4 points in 2020 and had been held by Republicans since 2011 prior to Gluesenkamp Perez s win.  The issues page of Kent s campaign website in 2021 and 2022 mentioned that he will work tirelessly to protect the rights of unborn children.  After the Dobbs decision Kent said in July 2022 I would move to have a national ban on abortions.  Running for the same seat in 2024 Kent s issues page makes no mention of abortion at all. In fact the entire issues page has disappeared from his campaign website altogether. In a social media post from January this year Kent reversed his abortion position. Post Dobbs decision it s a state issue. I don t support a national ban on abortion he said without acknowledging his previous stance. Kent s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN.   I would move to have a national ban on abortion.  Source YouTube  I don t support a national ban on abortion.  Source X A former New York City police officer Alison Esposito unsuccessfully ran for lieutenant governor of New York in 2022 on a ticket with Republican gubernatorial nominee Lee Zeldin.  In that race Esposito answered yes on a questionnaire from an antiabortion group asking if she d vote for legislation to protect innocent human life from conception to natural death.  Now running in a swing district for Congress Esposito says she opposes any abortion ban nationally.   I do NOT support a federal abortion ban she said in one February interview with local news in her district posted on X. I believe it s a state rights issue.  Esposito s campaign told CNN that her position on abortion has never changed citing New York s abortion laws. This is a states rights issue and Alison is concentrated on federal matters said a spokesperson.  In response to CNN s questions about her answer on the 2022 questionnaire the campaign said Alison was answering as a candidate for Lt. Governor in 2022. She rightly still believes that the issue of abortion should be a state issue. The campaign also said she believes in reasonable exceptions like rape incest and life of the mother.  Michigan congresional candidate Tom Barrett a former state senator once called himself completely prolife no exceptions in campaign flyers he sent out in 2022. He once told The Detroit News he did not support exceptions for rape or incest but that he considers prolife to be prolife for the mother as well.  In 2022 while running for this Central Michigan seat Barrett removed the values section of his campaign website that vowed he would always work to protect life from conception. Barrett lost his race for Congress in 2022 by 5 points to Democratic Rep. Elissa Slotkin who is now running for US Senate.  Now running for the same seat in 2024 Barrett lists no positions on abortion at all on his website.  A campaign strategist for Barrett told CNN Tom s position hasn t changed. He s consistently argued that this issue should be decided by the states and Michigan voters have already approved a constitutional amendment. Any changes to Michigan law will be up to the voters.  When asked if Barrett still did not support any exceptions for abortion the strategist pointed CNN to the previous statement. Former Rep. Yvette Herrell a Republican candidate for Congress in New Mexico was a cosponsor in 2021 of a bill called the Life at Conception Act which would recognize a fertilized egg as a person with equal protections under the 14th Amendment and effectively ban abortion in all cases and threaten in vitro fertilization.  Herrell lost her seat in 2022 and is running to win it back.  According to archived versions her campaign website previously stated With a consistent ProLife record in the New Mexico House of Representatives Yvette will be a tireless advocate for the unborn in Congress. 100 ProLife Yvette believes life starts at conception and will never waver in her beliefs.  Herrell no longer mentions abortion on her campaign website and campaign materials.  In response to a request for comment from CNN Herrell said in a statement that since the overturning of Roe v. Wade abortion policies are up to the states.   As a prolife woman it is important to me that we extend every option available to those who find themselves in an unplanned pregnancy to help them make an informed decision including access to women s health care services adoption opportunities and counseling. I will also continue to fully support profamily fertility treatments like IVF that provide hope for so many American families who want to experience the gift of parenthood as well as supporting increased access to birth control methods.  Her campaign said she supports exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother.  Former Texas Rep. Mayra Flores the first Mexicanborn woman to be elected to Congress won her seat in a 2022 special election but lost her reelection bid that November to 2022 Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez after the seat was redrawn following redistricting.

I do support exceptions for rape incest and the life of the mother. I also fully support fertility treatments like IVF that have helped so many families experience the joy of having children.  US Rep. Monica De La Cruz also from Texas removed from her website references of being prolife and advocating those values in Congress.  As a candidate in 2020 De La Cruz s website said that she believes that human life begins at conception and she ll fight for that value in Congress. She also listed proLife as a top issue on her page and stated she believed life began at conception.  De La Cruz now makes no mention of abortion on her website at all.  In response to a request for comment from CNN De La Cruz s campaign manager said in a statement Monica believes this sensitive issue requires common sense and compassion. Though this is primarily a state matter now Monica supports a balanced approach that values human life and upholds women s rights. This encompasses exceptions for women confronting heartbreaking decisions guaranteeing the availability of IVF treatments and enhancing prenatal care services. In a followup email the campaign manager said De La Cruz supports exceptions for rape incest and life of the mother. Virginia Rep.

The independent source for health policy research polling and news. Shannon Schumacher Ashley Kirzinger Audrey Kearney Isabelle Valdes and Liz HamelPublished Mar 07 2024 With former President Trump and President Biden now the presumptive presidential nominees for both parties the focus of voters has shifted from the presidential primaries to the 2024 general election and how the candidates positions on key voting issues could impact voters decisions. Last month s KFF Health Tracking Poll showed that partisans supported their own candidates when it came to two key health care issues affordability and the ACA. This month s poll explores voters preferences on another key voting issue abortion. With many issues competing for voters attention during this election cycle one in eight voters 12 say abortion is the most important issue to their vote in the 2024 election while half of voters 52 say it is a very important issue but not the most important. About one in three voters say either abortion is somewhat important 22 or not an important issue 14 to their 2024 vote. The share saying abortion is the most important issue includes 16 of all women voters and rises to more than one in four Black women voters 28 and about one in five in other key voting groups of women including Democratic women 22 women who currently live in states where abortion is banned1 19 women voters who say they plan to vote for President Biden 19 and women of reproductive age ages 18 to 49 17. At least twothirds of each of these groups say they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Prior to the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade prolife proponents and Republicans were the voters most likely to identify as single issue abortion voters. In fact twenty years ago prolife adults were nearly three times as likely as prochoice adults to describe themselves as singleissue voters on abortion. And in 2020 prior to the 2022 Dobbs decision a larger share of prolife voters than prochoice voters said abortion was important to their vote. Yet post Dobbs there seems to be a new generation of abortion voters. These voters are largely made up of those who want abortion to be legal in all cases. They also are disproportionately made up of Black voters Democratic voters women voters and the youngest voting bloc voters ages 18 to 29. In contrast about one in three voters who say abortion is the most important issue to their vote think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases.  Reflecting their Democratic leaning about half of abortion voters say if the 2024 presidential election was held today they would vote for Democrat Joe Biden 48 while one in four 26 say they would vote for Republican Donald Trump. A quarter of these voters say they would either vote for some other candidate 16 or they wouldn t vote 9. This group also went for President Biden over President Trump in the 2020 election by a nearly two to one margin 50 v. 27. About one in five in this group say they didn t vote in the 2020 presidential election. Slightly less than half of abortion voters 45 say they are more motivated to vote in this presidential election compared to previous ones while about a quarter 23 say they are less motivated to vote. Similarly overall 44 of voters say they are more motivated to vote in this year s presidential election. While abortion may not be a top voting issue for independent voters or Republican voters the issue may move small numbers within these groups to vote for President Biden which could matter in tight races. While just five percent of independent voters identify abortion as their most important issue and say if the election was held today they would vote for Biden overall onethird of independent voters want abortion to be legal and plan on supporting Biden. Among Republicans less than 1 identify abortion as their most important issue and plan on crossing the political aisle to vote for Biden but overall 3 of Republicans want abortion to be legal and say that if the election was held today they would vote for President Biden. While voters overall are split largely by their partisan identification in who they are planning on supporting in the upcoming presidential election President Biden has an advantage over former President Trump on who voters trust more to move abortion policy in the right direction. Four in ten voters 38 say they trust Biden compared to three in ten 29 who say they trust Trump. A notable share of voters say either that they don t trust either candidate to move abortion policy in the right direction 21 of voters or that they are unsure 11. Partisans largely say they trust their own party s candidate on abortion. Eight in ten 79 Democratic voters say they trust President Biden and seven in ten 70 Republicans say they trust former President Trump. Independent voters give President Biden the advantage on the issue of abortion with a third saying they trust him on this issue 35 compared to 19 who say they trust former President Trump. However one in three independent voters 31 say they don t trust either candidate on this issue as do more than one in ten Democratic voters 12 and one in six Republican voters 17. The same trends emerge when examining which political party voters trust more on abortion policy. The Democratic Party overall garners more trust among voters on abortion policy than the Republican Party 41 vs. 27 but still don t have a majority of voters trust. And while each party garners majority support from their own partisan voters and the Democratic Party has a more than two to one advantage among independent voters 38 v. 15 a significant share of independent voters 39 say they trust neither party. One in four 24 Republican voters say they trust neither party on the issue of abortion which is more than twice the share of Democratic voters who say the same 10. Women voters overall say they trust both the Democratic Party and President Joe Biden more on abortion policy in this country but trust varies depending on partisanship and age. In fact neither candidate nor party garners majority of support from women of reproductive age. Most Republican women voters trust former President Trump and the Republican Party to move abortion policy in the right direction but one in five say they don t trust either candidate or they don t trust either party. On the other side of the political aisle at least threefourths of Democratic women voters say they trust President Biden and the Democratic Party more on abortion policy and about one in seven say they don t trust either candidate or political party. Independent women voters are more than twice as likely to say they trust Biden 35 than Trump 16 to move abortion policy in the right direction. Similarly a larger share of independent women voters give the Democratic Party an advantage over the Republican Party 33 v. 10 but neither candidate nor party gets a majority of independent voters saying they trust them more on this issue. In addition about a third of independent women voters say they trust neither candidate 32 and four in ten say they trust neither party 42 on this issue. This suggests at least some independent women voters may be looking for different leadership from the political parties and the party s candidates for president on this key issue. About four in ten Republican voters 43 say they think abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Among this group of voters half 52 say they trust the Republican Party more on the issue of abortion 8 say they trust the Democratic Party and one in three 33 say they don t trust either political party on this issue. Similarly half of these Republican voters those who want abortion to be legal say they trust former President Trump more to move abortion policy in the right direction while 9 say they trust President Biden and more than a quarter 28 say they don t trust either candidate. Among Republicans who say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases both former President Trump and the Republican Party garner majorities of trust on this issue 85 and 80 respectively. Republicans who say abortion should be illegal are more likely to be singleissue abortion voters 14 8 of total Republican voters than those who say abortion should be legal 4 2 of total Republican voters. Republican voters regardless of their views on whether abortion should be legal or illegal are divided in former President Trump s role in the overturning of Roe v. Wade though leaning in slightly different directions. While former President Trump has taken credit for the 2022 Dobbs decision in past speeches because he had appointed three conservative judges which led to the ruling a majority of Republican voters who want abortion to be legal 56 say Trump had just a little or no responsibility in the overturning of Roe v. Wade. On the other hand more than half of Republican voters who want abortion to be illegal 54 say he has at least some responsibility. Overall twothirds of voters 65 say former President Trump had at least some responsibility for the overturning of Roe v. Wade but this is largely driven by the views of Democrats 83 and independents 64. Large shares of the public say they think the elections this fall will impact access to abortion both in this country and in their own states. At least half of voters overall say this year s elections for president 51 Congress 53 as well as which party controls their state legislature 55 will have a major impact on access to abortion in the U.S. and their state respectively. At least seven in ten singleissue abortion voters say each of these elections will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. or their state. Other than singleissue abortion voters Democratic voters are the most likely to say the elections will matter with at least twothirds saying they think the elections will have a major impact on abortion access in the U.S. and their state. About four in ten Republican voters say the same when considering the presidential 41 and Congressional 41 elections rising to about half 52 who say which political party controls the legislature in their state will have a major impact on access to abortion in their state. The views of women voters by partisanship largely mirror the patterns on these questions among partisans overall. Following the Dobbs decision and Justice Clarence Thomas concurrence opinion which questioned the basis for a prior Supreme Court case granting the right to contraception many predicted that contraception access also could be affected. The recent Alabama Supreme Court ruling that frozen embryos can be considered children further ignited public debate on the impact of abortion bans on access to other health services. Just under half 45 of adults say they consider the right to use contraception a secure right likely to remain in place while one in five 21 say they consider the right to use contraception a threatened right likely to be overturned. A third 34 are not sure if the right to use contraception is threatened or secured. Partisans are split with Democrats more likely to see the right to contraception as threatened while Republicans see it more as a secure right. About four in ten Democrats 38 including four in ten 41 Democratic women consider the right to contraception threatened whereas about six in ten Republicans 57 including six in ten Republican women 61 say they consider contraception access secure. At least three in ten across partisans say they are not sure about the future of the right to contraception. Similar shares of women of reproductive age 18 to 49 and women ages 50 and older consider the right to use contraception secure with about four in ten saying so. When asked specifically about how the elections this fall may impact access to contraception in the U.S. about four in ten voters overall say the elections for president 37 Congress 39 and which party controls the legislature in their state 43 will have a major impact. About half or more of singleissue abortion voters say the presidential election 53 Congressional election 59 or which party controls the legislature in their state 54 will have a major impact on access to contraception. And majorities of Democratic voters say they think the three elections will have a major impact on access to contraception whereas three in ten or fewer Republican voters say the same. The public overwhelmingly thinks decisions about abortions should be made by women in consultation with their health care providers 80 while 19 say lawmakers should make decisions about when abortions should be available and under what conditions. The share who say the decisionmaking should fall to women remains unchanged since the Dobbs decision and includes large majorities of Democrats 94 and independents 81 and most Republicans 62. Nearly nine in ten 86 women between the ages of 18 and 49 say decisions about abortion should be made by women and their health care providers as do almost all Democratic women 94 eight in ten independent women 83 and seven in ten Republican women 70. While most of the public doesn t think lawmakers should decide when abortions should be available many states are passing laws regulating abortion access and there has been public debate about whether the federal government should take action on this issue. Overall a majority of the public 55 say they would rather see the federal government pass laws to protect abortion access nationwide while a quarter 25 say they want to see the federal government take no action and a fifth 19 want the federal government to pass laws prohibiting abortions. Three in four Democrats 77 say they would rather see the federal government pass laws to protect abortion access as do six in ten 58 independents. Republicans on the other hand are divided between wanting the federal government to pass laws prohibiting abortions nationwide 36 and wanting the federal government to not act on this issue 37. About a quarter 26 of Republicans want the government to pass laws to protect abortion nationwide. Women of reproductive age want the federal government to pass laws to protect abortion nationwide 65 as do large majorities of Democratic women 79 and independent women 64. Republican women are more divided with similar shares wanting the government to pass laws prohibiting abortion 35 take no action 34 and pass laws to protect abortion 30. In states where abortion is either banned or limited half of adults 52 say they would rather see the federal government pass laws to protect abortion nationwide including threefourths 74 of Democratic and Democraticleaning women living in those states. Republican and Republicanleaning women living in states where abortion is banned or limited are divided with similar shares who say they want the federal government to pass laws prohibiting abortion nationwide 40 as say they want laws protecting abortion nationwide 35. Overall a majority of the public supports protecting access to abortions for patients who are experiencing pregnancyrelated emergencies such as miscarriages 86 protecting a patient s right to travel in order to get an abortion 79 and protecting doctors who perform abortions from receiving fines or facing prison time 67. Twothirds of the public also support a law guaranteeing a federal right to abortion. Less than half 42 of the public support a law establishing a 16week ban on abortion. In addition most of the public opposes many of the policies antiabortion groups are advocating for aimed at restricting or banning medication abortion such as making it a crime for health care provider to mail medication abortion to patients living in states where abortions are banned 62 or banning the use of medication abortion nationwide 66. Most of the public 61 also opposes policies that prohibit clinics that receive federal funds from providing abortions or referring patients to abortion providers. The group that stands to be impacted most by these proposals women of reproductive age 1849 also support protecting access to abortion including opposing laws restricting access to medication abortion. Threefourths 76 of women between the ages of 18 and 49 support laws guaranteeing a federal right to abortion while four in ten 38 support a 16week abortion ban. There is consensus support across partisans for some reproductive health proposals such as protecting access to abortions for patients who are experiencing miscarriages protecting a patient s right to travel in order to get an abortion and protecting doctors who perform abortions from receiving fines or facing prison time. But support for other proposals including both a federal right to abortion and a 16week abortion ban vary widely depending on partisanship. While majorities of Democrats 86 and independents 67 adults support a law guaranteeing a federal right to abortion this is opposed by nearly six in ten Republicans 57. In addition while a majority of Republicans 63 support a federal 16week abortion ban a policy that former President Trump has quietly supported in recent weeks a majority of Democrats 75 and independents 59 oppose this proposal. The large partisan disagreement on proposals aimed at legislating abortion access may be driven by how differently Democrats and Republicans view the issue. Democrats overwhelmingly view the issue of abortion as an issue of individual rights and freedom 96 as well as a health care issue 82. Republicans on the other hand are more likely to view it as a moral issue 81 and more than half 55 of Republicans also say it is a religious issue. Since the overturning of Roe medication abortion has been the focus of policy debates at the state and federal level yet there is extensive uncertainty on whether medication abortion is legal or illegal given that its legality depends on state laws. Overall more than one in three 36 adults say they understand the abortion laws in their state less than somewhat well including onethird 32 of women of reproductive age ages 18 to 49. And while a slim majority 54 of the public has heard of mifepristone the medication abortion pill the legality and use of the medication continues to be misunderstood across the public. About four in ten women 43 are unsure whether medication abortion is legal in the state they live in including 38 of women ages 1849. Nationally at least four in ten U.S. adults say they are not sure whether the medication is legal where they live regardless of whether they live in a state where abortion is limited 54 say they are unsure banned 44 or available 41. In addition about one in eight adults 13 including a similar share 11 of women living in states where abortion is currently banned incorrectly believe medication abortion is legal in their state. Women without a college degree are more likely to say they are unsure about the legality of medication abortion in their state with half 50 of women without a college degree saying they are unsure compared to about one in three 32 of women with a college degree. In addition to confusion around state abortion laws and whether mifepristone is legal or not there is also a general lack of understanding of what the pill is used for. About one in five 19 adults correctly say that mifepristone can be used to treat a miscarriage while about one in ten 8 incorrectly say it cannot be used for this purpose and about three in four 73 are unsure whether mifepristone can also be used to treat a miscarriage or not. Across gender age and education at least six in ten adults say they are unsure about whether mifepristone can also be used to treat a miscarriage. However women with a college degree 34 and women of reproductive age 29 are the groups most likely to be aware that mifepristone can also be used to treat a miscarriage. There is also widespread misunderstanding about when most abortions occur. Public debate continues to circulate around socalled lateterm abortions which typically refer to abortions obtained at or after 21 weeks. The latest KFF Health Tracking Poll finds that twothirds 67 of adults are unaware that less than 5 of abortions occur more than 20 weeks into a pregnancy while onethird of adults 32 correctly say that five percent or fewer abortions occur before this point. Indeed abortions at or after 21 weeks are uncommon and represent 1 of all abortions in the U.S. And despite claims of abortions occurring moments before birth or after birth scenarios like these do not occur nor are they legal in the United States. Similar majorities of adults across age and gender are unaware of this statistic. However women who are college graduates are more likely to correctly say less than five percent of abortions occur after 20 weeks than are women with lower levels of education 45 vs. 26. Currently FDA policy allows mifepristone pills to be prescribed via telehealth mailed to patients and dispensed at inperson pharmacies. However this policy update is currently being legally challenged by antiabortion groups. On March 26 2024 the Supreme Court is set to hear oral arguments challenging the safety and the conditions in which the Mifepristone can be dispensed which may impact if and how patients can access the drug including in states where abortion is currently available. About twothirds 64 of adults have not heard anything in the news regarding this court case while 18 have heard just a little 15 have heard some and few 4 have heard a lot. About six in ten 59 women under the age of 50 living in states where abortion is currently available a group that could also be affected if the court rules to restore limits on dispensing mifepristone are unaware of the case.

Courts legislatures presidential campaigns and everyday Americans are all still grappling with the end of Roe v. Wade two years ago.   The US Supreme Court will hear its second abortionrights case in as many months Wednesday when it will consider whether hospitals have an obligation under federal law to provide emergency abortions to women who are in medical emergencies.   CNN Related article See where abortions are banned and legal and where it s still in limbo   A restrictive sixweek abortion law in the oncekey electoral state of Florida goes into effect on May 1 and has Democrats hoping to use the issue to make it a battleground once again. The new Florida law has limited exemptions for rape incest and to protect the life of the mother.   A restrictive 1864 law goes back into effect for the first time in anyone s lifetime in Arizona as early as June 8 according to the state attorney general in an online post trying to explain the law for citizens although she says things are in flux. The state House has so far squashed efforts to repeal the 160yearold abortion ban which includes only an exemption to protect the life of the mother but the state Senate has left the door open. Supporters of repealing the bill hope to try again in the state House to get a vote on their repeal measure.   President Joe Biden visited Florida to focus on abortion rights Tuesday. Vice President Kamala Harris was in Arizona recently and she talked there to CNN s EdwardIsaac Dovere saying she hopes to take on the role of prosecutor against former President Donald Trump for appointing onethird of the Supreme Court that overturned Roe v. Wade.   Biden and Harris very much want to protect abortion rights in federal law but currently lack the votes in both the House and Senate. Trump has said he would leave abortion policy to the states rather than try to implement a nationwide abortion restriction.   Referendums placing the issue of abortion rights before voters will be on the ballot in Arizona and Florida.   It is the cases currently before the Supreme Court that could have the most direct effect on the new reality for pregnant American women. Justices will hear arguments Wednesday regarding a federal law from 1986 that is supposed to require hospitals that receive federal money to stabilize the health of emergency room patients.   The Biden administration sued Idaho over its strict abortion ban which does include a narrow exception for when the life of the mother is at stake but does not allow for abortion when the mother is in a medical emergency that is not yet life threatening.   CNN s Tierney Sneed has a larger look at the Idaho case which she notes has proceeded somewhat under the radar and not attracted the same amount of attention as a separate case where the Supreme Court is considering the Food and Drug Administration s approval of a drug that has been used in medical abortions for decades. Read more from Sneed.   There is a growing number of stories of pregnant women in distress but denied emergency care in states with outright abortion bans or restrictive laws.   The emergency room issue going before the Supreme Court would not have affected Jen Adkins a woman CNN profiled in February. Adkins felt she needed to rush six hours up the freeway to Portland Oregon when doctors in Idaho told her that her fetus likely had a disorder that could result in a miscarriage and that continuing with the pregnancy could harm her but that they couldn t perform an abortion.   In their report about Adkins CNN s Meg Tirrell and John Bonifield describe something new doctors are recommending for pregnant women in states with tight abortion restrictions. Tirrell and Bonifield write   Dr. Julie Lyons a family medicine physician across the state in Hailey near Sun Valley who s also a plaintiff in the lawsuit said she now discusses life flight insurance with pregnant patients in their first prenatal visits in case they have a pregnancy complication that doctors can t treat in Idaho.   It s a little bit terrifying to know that we can t practice our full scope that we are now needing to manage and triage patients often outside of the state to get the reproductive health care that they need Lyons said.   Another woman Allie Phillips flew to New York from Tennessee to get away from her state s restrictive abortion law and obtain care rather than carry her nonviable fetus to term. Now she s running for a seat in the Tennessee House of Representatives part of a Dobbs effect of women affected by the end of Roe v. Wade getting involved in politics. Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization is the 2022 decision that overturned Roe.   Last year a Texas woman Amanda Zurawski testified in the US Senate after she was denied an abortion when she experienced complications with her pregnancy. She was later given an emergency abortion after going into septic shock. Zurawski is suing the state of Texas.

Biden s trip to Florida Tuesday to highlight lack of abortion access in Trump s adopted home is just one event in a strategic effort to focus on abortion rights and argue that exemptions to restrictive abortion laws are not working in states that have them.   First lady Jill Biden for instance invited Kate Cox a Texas woman to sit with her at this year s State of the Union address. Cox fled Texas to obtain an abortion just before the state Supreme Court denied her access to the care under the medical exemption in Texas abortion law. Read more from CNN s Priscilla Alvarez and Michael Williams about the Biden campaign s strategy.   President Joe Biden speaks during a campaign stop at Hillsborough Community Colleges Dale Mabry campus in Tampa Florida on April 23 2024. During the event Biden spoke about abortion rights. Joe RaedleGetty Images Harris settles into new role Dovere interviewed Harris in Arizona where a state Supreme Court ruling and lack of action in the Republicancontrolled legislature mean the neartotal abortion ban from 1864 will likely again be law in the state.   Harris he wrote is taking on the role of a political prosecutor during the coming election. She will try to lay out the case that Trump who appointed justices to overturn Roe will take away freedoms if he s returned to the White House.   The prosecutor approach is really about just deconstructing an issue she said. It s presenting and reminding folks about the empirical evidence that shows us exactly how we arrived at this point. He can t hide from this stuff.   Just before coming on stage in Arizona Harris and a few aides scrambled to add in a line to go right at what Trump had said minutes before that the US Supreme Court s Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade is working the way it is supposed to.   Women facing the prospect of needing to seek a court order for an emergency abortion or being forced out of state are unlikely to agree.

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/abortion-access-on-the-ballot-in-2024/,  By Shawna Mizelle Allison Novelo   Updated on April 2 2024 1100 AM EDT CBS News  Of the six states that have already voted on abortion access all have moved to protect abortion rights including California Kansas Kentucky Michigan Ohio and Vermont.  Currently abortion is legal in Arizona until 15 weeks of pregnancy with restrictions. Abortions on the basis of race sex or genetic abnormality are prohibited. Abortion access proponents are collecting signatures to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would ensure the right to an abortion until viability. They must collect 383923 signatures by early July and by midJanuary had reached 250000. Arkansas prohibits abortions with exceptions only to save the life of the mother. Abortion rights advocates are trying to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would ensure the right to an abortion up to 18 weeks of pregnancy with no prohibitions on the procedure in cases of fetal anomaly rape incest or if the womans health could be impacted. Organizers are trying to collect 90704 signatures by the July 5 deadline.  Abortion is legal in Colorado and a state constitutional amendment would prevent the government from taking away the right or disallowing health insurance coverage for abortions. To qualify for the ballot 124238 signatures are required as well as 2 of the total registered voters in each of the 35 Colorado state senate districts according to the Colorado secretary of states office. Florida used to allow abortions up to 24 weeks of pregnancy but it passed a 15week ban in 2022 and last year Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an even more restrictive sixweek ban into law. The 15week ban was challenged in the courts by Planned Parenthood which argued that the states protections of the right to privacy included abortion. On April 1 2024 the Florida Supreme Court in keeping with the U.S. Supreme Courts 2022 decision rejecting the privacy argument and striking down Roe upheld the 15week ban and ruled that the sixweek ban would go into effect within 30 days.  On the same day the state supreme court allowed a proposed constitutional amendment would prohibit abortion restrictions until fetal viability to appear before voters in November. It will require a supermajority of 60 support to pass. Abortion is legal in Maryland but voters will have the opportunity to enshrine the law in the state constitution in November. Marylands existing law enacted in 1991 safeguarded abortion rights in case the U.S. Supreme Court restricted abortion. In a 1992 referendum 62 of voters affirmed their support for this law. Maryland lawmakers in the House voted 98 to 38 last March to amend the state constitution to protect the right to abortion and the bill has also cleared the state Senate. The amendment will be on the ballot for voters in November requiring a simple majority for approval. Abortion rights supporters want to amend the state constitution to allow abortion in Missouri where the procedure is currently prohibited unless its necessary to protect the health or life of the woman. According to the Missouri secretary of states office roughly 170000 signatures from six out of eight congressional districts must be collected by the May 5 deadline to get the measure on the ballot in November.  In Montana abortion is legal until the fetus is viable. Abortion rights supporters have proposed a constitutional amendment to protect abortion access but the Republican Montana attorney general is blocking the ballot measure. Abortion rights proponents have petitioned the Montana Supreme Court asking it to intervene. Nebraska has a 12week abortion ban that was enacted last May. Abortion access advocates are trying to embed abortion rights in the state constitution with a proposed ballot initiative that would establish the right to an abortion until viability and ensure legal protection for maternal health and life. Supporters of the constitutional amendment must collect over 120000 signatures from registered voters and must also secure additional signatures from at least 5 of registered voters in a minimum of 38 out of the states 93 counties. Signatures for ballot initiatives or referendums must be submitted by July four months before the general election. Abortion is permissible in Nevada up to 25 weeks and 6 days. Last September an abortion rights coalition made up of Planned Parenthood Reproductive Freedom for All Nevada and the American Civil Liberties Union of Nevada filed a petition with the secretary of states office to propose a ballot question directed at embedding abortion protections in the state constitution. The groups are in the process of collecting 103000 signatures from Nevadans in order to put the measure on the ballot in November. The deadline for collecting the signatures is June 26. If approved by a simple majority abortion rights will return for consideration on the 2026 ballot since secondary passage is necessary to amend the state constitution. In New York abortion is permitted until 24 weeks of pregnancy. Beyond this point abortion is allowed solely in cases where the fetus is incompatible with life or when its deemed necessary to safeguard the mothers life or health. In November voters will be presented with a state Equal Rights Amendment seeking to enshrine various rights such as abortion and LGBTQ rights into the state constitution. The amendment will be approved if its supported by a simple majority. The Democraticmajority Legislature approved the amendment in two consecutive state legislative sessions first in July 2022 and then again in January 2023 enabling it to undergo a statewide vote.  In South Dakota abortion is illegal classified as a Class 6 felony with penalties of up to two years in prison and a 4000 fine for providers who perform an abortion that is not lifesaving for the mother. The law allows abortion only when deemed necessary to save the mothers life with no exceptions for rape or incest. South Dakotans who support abortion access want to amend the state constitution to allow abortions during the first trimester which ends at about 12 weeks and also allow secondtrimester abortions if necessary for the health of the mother. Theyre hoping to get the measure on the ballot this fall by collecting 35017 signatures by May 7. The amendment requires a simple majority to pass. Dakotans for Health filed a petition in June of 2022 proposing regulations for secondtrimester abortions linked solely to the physical health of the pregnant individual and a ban in the third trimester with exemptions for the life or health of the pregnant person. The Republicancontrolled Iowa Legislature enacted a sixweek abortion ban in July which is currently under judicial review. After the overturning of Roe v. Wade Iowa courts rescinded a previous ruling safeguarding abortion rights. Now abortion opponents are promoting a legislative initiative aiming to embed a ban on abortion rights in the Iowa constitution. The proposed no right to an abortion amendment asserts that the state constitution does not recognize grant or guarantee a right to abortion or mandate public funding for abortion services. Both chambers of the General Assembly must first approve the measure in consecutive sessions before it can be put on the ballot in November. Former president Donald Trump often boasts about his role in ending the federal right to an abortion having appointed three Supreme Court justices who ultimately voted with the majority decision to return abortion law to the states. But he warned Republicans to be cautious about pressing an abortion ban because it may be a losing issue for them. He also favors exceptions to abortion bans in cases of rape incest and the life of the mother. Nikki Haley has repeatedly said that while she supports a national abortion ban and opposes abortion access its impossible to pass such legislation because of the high bar needed in the Senate. She has instead promised to find common ground on the issue.  Democrats have scared people thinking that their rights are going to go away. and Republicans have judged people and both are wrong. We shouldnt use fear or judgment with any of this. We need to use respect when were dealing with something thats personal she said on the campaign trail in November.  President Bidens reelection campaign is relying heavily on the assumption that abortion access will again galvanize voters in November as it did in 2022. The president has vowed to restore the abortion protections under Roe if he wins reelection and both chambers of Congress have Democratic majorities.  Abortion is also a major issue in Senate races including in Ohio where Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown is trying to hold onto his seat as the Buckeye state leans further to the right.

Chasity MaynardTallahassee Democrat via AP File A push to ask Arizona voters to add a right to abortion to the state constitution took on new stakes this week when the state s Supreme Court ruled that the state can enforce a ban on abortion in all stages of pregnancy. Arizona is one of several states where abortion might be on the ballot this year. Across the country there have been increased efforts to put abortion rights questions to voters since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and removed the nationwide right to abortion.  Since that 2022 decision most Republicancontrolled states have new abortion restrictions in effect including 14 that ban it at every stage of pregnancy. Most Democratdominated states have laws or executive orders to protect access. Additionally voters in seven states California Kansas Kentucky Michigan Montana Ohio and Vermont have sided with abortion rights supporters on ballot measures. It s not clear yet how many states will vote on measures to enshrine abortion access in November. In some the question is whether amendment supporters can get enough valid signatures. In others it s up to the legislature. And there s legal wrangling in the process in some states.  Arizona Democrats attempt to repeal the state s 19th century abortion ban Supreme Court to consider when doctors can provide emergency abortions in states with bans When can doctors provide emergency abortions in states with strict bans? Supreme Court to weigh in Some of the efforts have already failed to reach ballots. Wisconsin s legislative session ended without a state Senate vote on a measure that the House approved to ask voters to ban abortion after 14 weeks. A Louisiana measure to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution died in committee and one in Maine effectively died when it fell short of receiving the approval of twothirds of the House. The state Supreme Court ruled on April 1 that a ballot measure to legalize abortion until viability could go on the ballot despite a legal challenge from state Attorney General Ashley Moody who argued that there are differing views on the meaning of viability and that some key terms in the proposed measure are not properly defined. Advocates collected nearly a million signatures to put a state constitutional amendment to legalize abortion until viability on the ballot surpassing the nearly 892000 required. Sixty percent of voters would have to agree for it to take effect. Abortion is legal in Florida through the first 15 weeks of pregnancy. But a separate April 1 state Supreme Court ruling upholding the current law triggers a 2023 law would drop that to six weeks often before women know they re pregnant to take effect on May 1. Maryland voters this year will also be asked whether to enshrine the right for women to end their pregnancies in the state s constitution in a ballot question put before them by lawmakers last year. The state already protects the right to abortion under state law and Democrats outnumber Republicans 21. Abortion is allowed in Maryland until viability. New York lawmakers agreed to ask voters to bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy pregnancy outcome and reproductive healthcare as part of a broader equal protection amendment. It would also bar discrimination on the basis of sex sexual orientation gender identity national origin and disability. The language of the constitutional amendment does not mention abortion specifically. Abortion is allowed in New York law until viability. A signature drive is underway to add a constitutional right to abortion in Arizona. Under the measure the state would not be able to ban abortion until the fetus is viable with later abortions allowed to protect a woman s physical or mental health. Supporters must gather nearly 384000 valid signatures by July 4. An April 9 Arizona Supreme Court decision allows a ban on abortion throughout pregnancy to be enforced starting April 23.  Proponents of an amendment to allow abortion in many cases have until July 5 to gather nearly 91000 valid signatures to get it on the Nov. 5 ballot. The measure would bar laws banning abortion in the first 20 weeks of gestation and allow abortion later in pregnancy in cases of rape incest threats to the woman s health or life or if the fetus would be unlikely to survive birth. Because it allows limits as soon as 20 weeks the proposal does not have the support of Planned Parenthood Great Plains which includes Arkansas. The state has a ban on abortion at all stages of pregnancy with narrow exceptions. There are dueling efforts on abortion in Colorado. One measure would create a voterinitiated law to ban access throughout pregnancy and the other would amend the state constitution to protect it. The abortion rights amendment would also require Medicaid and private health insurance to cover abortion. Supporters on each side have to submit more than 124000 signatures to get a measure on the ballot. The deadlines to submit them are April 15 for the ban measure and April 26 for the one to ensure access. Amending the constitution in Colorado requires the support of 55 of voters. But the ban could be passed with a simple majority. Abortion is legal at all stages of pregnancy in Colorado. Pushes are underway to get multiple abortionrelated ballot measures before Missouri voters in 2024. Abortion rights advocates in Missourians for Constitutional Freedom are pushing for one that would guarantee abortion is legal until viability. A group of moderate Republicans are taking a different approach and calling for an amendment that would allow abortion up to 12 weeks and after that only under limited exceptions. Supporters of each measure must submit more than 171000 valid signatures by May 5 to get them on the ballot. And some Republican lawmakers have launched a legislative process to put before voters a measure to enshrine a ban on abortion in the state constitution. It would expand provide an exception to allow for immediate abortion to save the life of the woman or in cases for which a delay will create a serious risk of substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function. Further exceptions would have to be approved by voters. Abortion is currently banned in Missouri at all stages of pregnancy with limited exceptions. Abortion rights proponents in Montana have proposed a constitutional amendment that would bar the government from denying the right to abortion before viability or when it s necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant person. After a legal battle over the ballot language the Montana Supreme Court on April 1 wrote its version of the language that would appear on the ballot if supporters gather more than 60000 signatures by June 21. Abortion is legal until viability in Montana under a 1999 Montana Supreme Court opinion. Advocates are trying to collect about 125000 signatures needed by July 5 to put a constitutional amendment before voters to protect abortion rights until fetal viability. Under a law adopted last year abortion is banned after 12 weeks with some exceptions. Signatures are being gathered to place an abortion access amendment on Nevada s ballot in November. Under the amendment abortion access for the first 24 weeks of pregnancy or later to protect the health of the pregnant person which is already assured under a 1990 law would be enshrined in the constitution. It requires more than 102000 valid signatures by June 26 to place the measure on the ballot. Voters would need to approve it in both 2024 and 2026 to change the constitution. The measure is one of several attempts by Nevada abortion rights groups to get a ballot question before voters in 2024 or 2026. South Dakota advocates are attempting to gather more than 35000 signatures by May 7 to get a measure on the ballot that would loosen restrictions but does not go as far as many abortion rights advocates would like. It would ban any restrictions on abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. It would allow the state in the second trimester to regulate the pregnant woman s abortion decision and its effectuation only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman. An abortion ban would be allowed in the third trimester as long as it included exceptions for the life and health of the woman. Planned Parenthood is not supporting the measure. Abortion in the state is now banned at all stages of pregnancy with narrow exceptions. There are some states where the balance of power or other circumstances make abortionrelated measures most of them seeking bans or limits unlikely to reach voters in 2024. To put a constitutional amendment on the ballot Iowa lawmakers have to approve it in two consecutive sessions. In 2021 both chambers advanced a resolution to find there is no constitutional right to abortion in the state. Republicans control the Legislature and governor s office but the amendment has not emerged as a priority this year and Gov. Kim Reynolds has said she ll let the issue move through the courts rather than pushing for a vote. Abortion is currently banned 20 weeks into pregnancy. A stricter ban which would kick in when cardiac activity can be detected around six weeks has been adopted but put on hold by a court. Pennsylvania has a similar process as Iowa with a similar amendment to find no constitutional right to abortion up for consideration. Lawmakers passed it in 2022. But Democrats have since taken control of the state House making it unlikely to pass which is required before it can go to a statewide referendum. Abortion is now legal in Pennsylvania up to 24 weeks of pregnancy.  The Associated Press is an independent global news organization dedicated to factual reporting.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2024/abortion-ballot-measures/, Abortion rights advocates have reason to be hopeful Since the Supreme Court s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022 every ballot measure that has sought to preserve or expand abortion access has been successful while those that have sought to restrict abortion access have failed even in states that skew conservative. The push to protect reproductive rights has been buoyed by the imposition of recent restrictions at the state level. In Florida a ruling by the state s Supreme Court cleared the way for a sixweek abortion ban to go into effect on May 1. Similarly Arizona s Supreme Court ruled in April that a neartotal ban dating back to 1864 before Arizona had become a state could go into effect. President Biden and Democrats have seized on reproductive rights as a key issue on which to attack Republicans and former president Donald Trump the presumptive GOP nominee who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing three of the Supreme Court justices who later helped overturn Roe. Trump has also said that abortion policy should be left to the states. Current law Florida s Supreme Court ruled in April that the state s constitution does not protect abortion rights. The case centered on the state s existing 15week ban which took effect in the summer of 2022. But the court s ruling triggered a far stricter law passed last year and signed by Gov. Ron DeSantis R that will outlaw abortion after six weeks of pregnancy before many people know they re pregnant. Florida s sixweek ban is slated to take effect May 1. The initiative The citizendriven initiative to pass the Amendment to Limit Government Interference with Abortion is led by Floridians Protecting Freedom. It would codify in the state constitution a right to abortion until viability.  State of play The group says it surpassed the required 891523 verified signatures due by Feb. 1. Florida s Supreme Court in a separate decision in April ruled that the amendment can go on the November ballot a vote that could undo the sixweek abortion ban in a matter of months. The politics Florida is a crucial state for the abortion rights movement. Former president Donald Trump now calls Florida home and won the state by more than three percentage points in 2020. There is also a Senate race in Florida that is seen as a pickup opportunity for Democrats. Current law Since 1992 Maryland has allowed abortion until viability and after viability if the life or health of the mother is at risk or if the fetus isn t viable. The initiative The Right to Reproductive Freedom initiative is a legislativebacked measure that would add the right to an abortion to the Declaration of Rights section in the state constitution. State of play The measure failed in the legislature before Roe was overturned but a revived bill passed both chambers with the required 60 percent support in 2023 placing it on the November ballot. The politics Maryland is a deepblue state that Biden won by more than 33 percentage points. Abortion rights advocates hope candidates vowing to protect rights will be buoyed by the ballot measure in local races. Current law Abortion until 24 weeks gestation is legal in New York. The initiative A legislaturedriven initiative would protect abortion rights as part of an expanded Equal Rights Amendment that will appear on the ballot in November. The measure would protect against discrimination for pregnancy and pregnancy outcomes and would protect against government action that could limit reproductive care. State of play The New York legislature fulfilled the requirement of passing the ERA twice consecutively through the legislature in July 2022 and again in January 2023. It will be on the ballot in November. The politics New York is a blue state that Biden won by more than 30 points. But New York will be a crucial battleground to determine control of the U.S. House with seven competitive seats. Current law In April Arizona s Supreme Court upheld a territorial law one that was passed in 1864 before Arizona became a state that bans and criminalizes almost all abortions. Though state Attorney General Kris Mayes D has vowed not to enforce the law the ban is expected to threaten abortion providers. The initiative Arizona for Abortion Access a coalition of abortion rights advocates is behind a proposed ballot measure that would enshrine the right to an abortion in the state s constitution. State of play The campaign must submit 383923 valid signatures by July 3 to appear on the 2024 ballot. Advocates have already gathered more than enough signatures to qualify according to the Arizona Republic. A simple majority is required to pass the ballot measure. The politics Arizona is a battleground state that will be critical this year. Rep. Ruben Gallego D and Republican Kari Lake are in a tight race for the Senate seat held by Sen. Kyrsten Sinema IAriz. who is not seeking reelection. In 2020 Biden won Arizona by only 0.3 percentage points becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win there since 1996. Current law Nevada state law allows abortion up to 24 weeks of pregnancy and after 24 weeks when a doctor has reasonable cause to believe it is necessary to preserve the life or health of the pregnant person.  The initiatives A coalition called Nevadans for Reproductive Freedom filed paperwork last year for a ballot initiative that would amend the state constitution to make decisions about all matters relating to pregnancy a fundamental right. The group filed a second narrower petition that would enshrine into the Nevada constitution the right to an abortion until fetal viability or when needed to protect the life or health of the pregnant patient.  State of play A district court judge struck down the group s first petition saying it covered more than a single subject but abortion rights advocates are hopeful the state s Supreme Court will rule in their favor on appeal. The campaign must submit 102362 valid signatures for either petition by June 26. Nevada requires two consecutive votes of the people to amend the constitution through a citizeninitiated ballot measure meaning that if the ballot measure passes with a simple majority in 2024 the question will return to the ballot in 2026. The politics Biden narrowly carried Nevada in 2020 and the battleground state continues to produce extremely tight races In 2022 Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won reelection by 0.8 percentage points. Having an abortion measure on the ballot in November could help Biden as well as Sen. Jacky Rosen D who is facing a tough race for reelection. Current law Montana has abortion protections in the state constitution under the right to privacy though Republicans who control the governor s office and both chambers of the legislature tried to pursue restrictions. The initiative An group called Montanans Securing Reproductive Rights filed paperwork in November for a ballot measure that would affirm in the state constitution the right to make and carry out decisions about one s own pregnancy including the right to abortion.  State of play In April the Montana Supreme Court approved revised language for the measure. Advocates have received the green light to begin signature gathering and must submit 60359 valid signatures by July 19. Montana voters in 2022 rejected a referendum that would have criminalized medical professionals if they did not give care to any infant born alive at any stage of development. The socalled born alive referendum was criticized for mischaracterizing abortions and it was ultimately defeated at the polls by more than five percentage points. The politics Sen. Jon Tester D is seeking reelection to a fourth term to the relief of many Democrats as the party faces a tough Senate map in 2024. Having an abortion measure on the ballot could boost Democratic turnout and help Tester. Current law Missouri has a neartotal ban on abortion with exceptions only for life endangerment and medical emergencies that went into effect after Roe was overturned. The initiative A group called Missourians for Constitutional Freedom is seeking to overturn the ban by enshrining in the state s constitution the right to make and carry out decisions about all matters relating to reproductive health care including abortion care. State of play After a long legal fight over ballot measure language advocates began gathering signatures in January. The group must submit at least 171592 valid signatures by May 5 to appear on the ballot. Republican lawmakers in the state legislature however are pushing bills that would make it harder to amend the state constitution through ballot initiatives. The politics Missouri has some of the strictest restrictions on abortion in the country and the state which Trump won by more than 15 points in 2020 is reliably conservative. Sen. Josh Hawley R is up for reelection this year against a tobedetermined Democratic opponent. Current law Arkansas has a neartotal ban on abortion with exceptions only for life endangerment that went into effect after Roe was overturned. The initiative A group called Arkansans for Limited Government proposed a constitutional amendment that prohibits the state from restricting abortion services within 18 weeks of fertilization as well as in cases of rape incest fetal anomaly or to protect a pregnant person s life or physical wellbeing. State of play After twice rejecting language for the ballot measure the Arkansas attorney general certified the proposal in January. Advocates must collect 90704 valid signatures by July 5 to gain ballot access. The politics Rubyred Arkansas will be an extremely challenging state for advocates to succeed in passing a measure expanding abortion access. Republicans control the governor s office and both chambers of the legislature and the entire congressional delegation is Republican. The group behind the measure is arguing that matters such as abortion are private and not to be dictated by the government.  The initiative Dakotans for Health last year filed paperwork proposing a citizeninitiated ballot measure that would establish a right to an abortion in the state s constitution. If passed the state could not regulate abortion during the first trimester of pregnancy could regulate abortion if reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman during the second trimester and could regulate or even ban abortion in the third trimester with exceptions for life or health of the pregnant woman.  State of play National reproductive rights groups are sitting out this campaign saying the language in the proposed ballot measure will not do enough to restore abortion rights. Advocates must submit 35017 signatures by May 7 to get on the ballot where it needs a simple majority to pass. The politics Trump defeated Biden in the state in 2020 with nearly 62 percent of the vote and Republicans control the governor s office and both chambers of the state legislature. All three members of the congressional delegation are Republican. Current law Colorado is the first state to statutorily protect abortion. It did so in 1967 five years before Roe was originally decided. While Colorado has had few limits on abortion a proposition passed in 1984 restricted the use of health insurance and Medicaid for abortion. The initiatives One ballot initiative would enshrine the right to abortion in the state constitution and would allow health insurance coverage of an abortion. Another ballot initiative would ban abortions without exception. It would also penalize facilities that provide abortions as well as individuals and providers who provide tools or medications used to perform abortions. State of play The initiative to enshrine abortion rights is being supported by a coalition called Coloradans for Protecting Reproductive Freedom. The antiabortion ballot measure was filed by representatives of the Colorado Life Initiative. For each initiative 124238 valid signatures are required. The measures would then be a yesorno vote on the ballot requiring 55 percent yes votes to be adopted. Coloradans for Protecting Reproductive Freedom announced Friday that it has collected 225000 signatures statewide. The group said it still must collect sufficient signatures in three state Senate districts to satisfy the state s ballot initiative distribution requirement. Abortion rights advocates beat back a ballot initiative in 2020 to restrict abortion rights before Roe was overturned. Coloradans overwhelmingly defeated it outperforming Biden at the top of the ticket by 25000 votes and Democrat John Hickenlooper who won the Senate race by more than 100000 votes. The politics Abortion rights groups have long been on the defensive. This is the first time they are being proactive and trying to pass a measure that enshrines the right in the constitution. Advocates were intentional in choosing a presidential year when voter turnout is expected to be high. Colorado has at least two competitive House races including that of Rep. Lauren Boebert R. Current law After Roe fell the Nebraska legislature passed a 12week abortion ban with no exceptions for the life and health of the mother after falling one vote short of a sixweek ban. The initiatives One citizendriven group Protect Our Rights is proposing a constitutional amendment to protect a right to abortion until fetal viability.  Another ballot initiative brought by a group of Nebraska medical professionals and backed by antiabortion groups would ban abortions after the first trimester with exceptions for rape incest and medical emergencies. The Nebraska Family Alliance one of the effort s proponents argues that by giving constitutional protections to preborn children in the state the ballot initiative would establish a floor of protection and stronger prolife laws could still be passed going forward.  State of play Advocates for both initiatives have begun collecting the roughly 128000 signatures of registered voters who hail from 38 counties as required by July. The politics Nebraska is a deepred state voting for Trump by 29 percentage points in 2020. Voters are increasingly using ballot initiatives in Nebraska to advance objectives the legislature refuses to take up. While incumbent Sen. Deb Fischer R is expected to easily win reelection if the abortion initiative makes the ballot it could impact the race of Rep. Don Bacon R who is one of the 17 Republican House members who represent a district Biden won in 2020. Current law The state legislature passed a sixweek abortion ban in July that is being tested in the courts. Days after Roe was overturned courts in Iowa reversed a previous decision that protected the right to an abortion. The initiative Antiabortion groups are pushing a legislative initiative that would prohibit the right to an abortion in the Iowa constitution. The no right to an abortion amendment says the Constitution does not recognize grant or secure a right to abortion or require the public funding of abortion.  State of play Both chambers of the General Assembly must pass the amendment in two consecutive sessions. Lawmakers passed the measure in the last session and must pass it for a second time in the current session that ends Tuesday for it to be on the ballot in November. Given the time constraints and complicated legislative approvals needed Iowa voters will likely not decide this question this year. The politics Iowa has become a reliably Republican state in recent elections with Biden losing by eight points in 2020. The state has at least one House race that could be competitive. Abortion rights groups are skeptical that the General Assembly will advance the amendment again after antiabortion defeats in similarly red Kansas and Ohio fearing it could boost Democratic turnout in a presidential election year. Current law Abortion in Pennsylvania is legal through the 23rd week of pregnancy. After that abortions are permitted in certain cases when the health of a pregnant person is in danger. The initiative In 2022 state lawmakers approved a constitutional amendment that declared that the commonwealth s charter provides no right to an abortion. If that were passed for a second time in the legislature it would go to a statewide referendum. State of play It s unlikely Pennsylvania lawmakers will approve the amendment again this year because Democrats have taken control of the state House. The politics While Trump took Pennsylvania in 2016 Biden won the commonwealth with 50 percent of the vote in 2020 and Democrats picked up a Senate seat two years later. This election cycle Sen. Bob Casey D faces a competitive reelection race. Danielle Paquette Molly HennessyFiske and Annie Gowen contributed to this report. Tracking abortion access in the United States Since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade the legality of abortion has been left to individual states. The Washington Post is tracking states where abortion is legal banned or under threat.  Abortion and the election Voters in about a dozen states could decide the fate of abortion rights with constitutional amendments on the ballot in a pivotal election year. Biden supports legal access to abortion and he has encouraged Congress to pass a law that would codify abortion rights nationwide. After months of mixed signals about his position Trump said the issue should be left to states. Here s how Trump s abortion stance has shifted over the years. New study The number of women using abortion pills to end their pregnancies on their own without the direct involvement of a U.S.based medical provider rose sharply in the months after the Supreme Court eliminated a constitutional right to abortion according to new research. Abortion pills The Supreme Court seemed unlikely to limit access to the abortion pill mifepristone. Here s what s at stake in the case and some key moments from oral arguments. For now full access to mifepristone will remain in place. Here s how mifepristone is used and where you can legally access the abortion pill.
