https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/mental-health-gun-possession-explainer/index.html,  While people who knew Nikolas Cruz describe a complicated picture of the 19yearold behind Wednesday s school shooting questions of mental health and gun laws are beginning to occupy the top tiers of American government.   According to a US official briefed on the investigation Cruz used an AR15 style weapon that he had bought legally after passing a background check to kill 17 students and adults at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.   As you know mental health is often a big problem underlying these tragedies House Speaker Paul Ryan said at a news conference Thursday reacting to the shooting. We have a system to prevent people who aren t supposed to get guns from getting guns and if there are gaps there then we need to look at those gaps.   Here s how that system works and how it could apply to the Parkland Florida shooter.   Under federal law a person can be tallied in a database and barred from purchasing or possessing a firearm due to a mental illness under two conditions if he is involuntarily committed to a mental hospital or if a court or government body declares him mentally incompetent.   In many states including Florida law enforcement can take an individual to a mental hospital against his or her will for an initial evaluation. If after 72 hours the doctors observing the individual want to continue that treatment then they can petition a court for permission even against the patient s wishes.   That a court order allowing a person s continued involuntary institutionalization is one thing that should stop an individual from purchasing a firearm.   If the person was taken in for mental treatment involuntarily but was not requested to be held past 72 hours he is not blocked from buying a gun.   In Florida if the court chose to commit even an underage individual he would fail a background check on that basis.   The other way to wind up in the database that could cause an individual to fail a background check for mental illness is if a court or government body were to rule that due to his mental health a person is a danger to himself or others or is unable to manage his own affairs.   The issue commonly arises when a court or government agency is appointing a conservator or a guardian for an adult because of mental impairment.   When either of those two things happens in Florida the court or government body that made the decision on the individual s mental health is required to report that record to a state law enforcement agency or the FBI.   The records would be in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System a confidential database that houses the names and birth years of individuals ineligible to buy firearms.   A licensed gun dealer is required under federal law to run potential buyers through the criminal background check system. The process usually takes around 90 seconds and if all the records are in the right place would prevent a purchaser who was previously involuntarily committed or adjudicated as mentally incompetent from getting the gun.   But federal law doesn t require states to make these mental health records part of background check system and many fail to voluntarily report the records.   And licensed gun shops aren t the only places to buy a firearm.   You could buy guns from someone from an online classified ad people at a yard sale or on the street corner selling guns or people who are at a gun show but not a retail dealer all without having to pass a background check according to Ari Freilich a legal expert with the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence a group that promotes gun control.   In a speech to the nation Thursday morning President Donald Trump promised to tackle the difficult issue of mental health. But so far his administration has only loosened federal gun laws related to the issue.   Early into his first year in the White House Trump signed a measure that got rid of a regulation aimed at keeping guns out of the hands of people who were either receiving full disability benefits because of mental illness and couldn t work or people who were unable to manage their own Social Security benefits and needed the help of third parties.   Using the Congressional Review Act Republican majorities in the House and Senate voted to revoke the rule that former President Barack Obama issued as part of a series of efforts to curb gun violence after similar measures failed to pass through Congress.   Trump signed the bill in private without his typical public signing ceremony meant to draw attention and fanfare.   He also rolled back an attempt by the Obama administration to clarify and broaden the statutory definitions of the terms that disable individuals who had been committed to mental institutions or adjudicated as mentally incompetent from buying guns.   The measure proposed by Obama in 2014 had been making its way through the rulemaking process but was stymied after the election by the new Trump administration according to federal documents shared with CNN by the advocacy group Democracy Forward.

This process only takes a few minutes.   There s a lot of information. There s a lot of questions here. There s disqualifying questions said Barry Laws president of Open Range a gun range and store in Crestwood. Laws has been a licensed federal firearms dealer for 16 years.  Some of the disqualifies include being a felon or not being a U.S. citizen. There s only one question about mental health asking if the person has ever been committed to a mental institution or if they have a mental disability.   If you say yes to that we can t transfer a firearm to you Laws said.  Like any other business Laws added his staff reserves the right to not sell someone a gun if they feel something seems off.   We do profiling here and its not the kind of profiling that youre going to think is profiling but we are very sensitive to people s emotions and how they re coming across so if there is anything strange about them we halt the process Laws said.  Still Laws believes more can be done to prevent guns from getting into the hands of people looking to cause harm.  One way Laws suggests are wellbeing checks on people who are denied from purchasing a firearm.   Just having somebody say hey are you OK? Sometimes that s the difference Laws said.  In years past Laws has reached out to lawmakers to offer suggestions for how the firearm purchasing process could be made safer. Laws said those requests were never answered.   I have never had a politician reach out to me and ask for my opinion on how to make this transaction safer how to make our society safer Laws said. We are the safety experts in firearms and I ve never been reached out to and I think that s just a travesty.  In its annual gun law scorecard the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence gave Kentucky an F rating.   The best approach to stopping those kinds of tragedies is to create what s called an extreme risk protection order Lindsay Nichols policy director for the Giffords Law Center said.  Nichols said one solution is legislation allowing firearms to be temporarily taken away from a person who feels the need to harm themselves or others. A Crisis Aversion and Rights Retention bill was not filed during the 2023 legislative session.   There are these emergency risk protection order laws which are a good way to solve not just our mass shooting problem but our gun suicide problem and other forms of gun violence Nichols said.  Laws said he would support laws like this in Kentucky.  Both agree more needs to be done to address mental health.   So what is it about our youth our young people mostly it seems like that are taking guns and feel its appropriate to take another life Laws said.   We need a better approach and we need to prevent access to the weapons that are making these events possible Nichols added.  Leaders of Kentucky s legislature have yet to comment on gun reform laws following Monday s mass shooting. 
https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2022/06/16/gun-checks-mental-health-records-can-still-blind-spot/7582379001/, Mental health records are a key prong in the system. But three states New Hampshire Montana and Wyoming still refuse to submit them. As U.S. Senators iron out gun reform initiatives many Republicans like Sen. John Cornyn of Texas have repeatedly pointed to legislation that stops people with criminal records or mental health challenges from obtaining firearms. Cornyn backed a 2018 bill that sought to shore up the FBI s National Instant Criminal Background Check System or NICS in the wake of a Texas church shooting that left 27 dead. The fatalities included the gunman an Air Force airman whose criminal records that would have barred him from purchasing guns had not been submitted to NICS.  For years agencies and states haven t complied with the law failing to upload these critical records without consequence Cornyn said while celebrating the Fix NICS solutions that pushed for faster and more accurate submissions. Just one record that s not properly reported can lead to tragedy.  President Donald Trump signed that bill which has pumped 615 million into states to close loopholes and shore up reporting into the FBIs system. States have made significant progress reporting into the database of 26 million records including for 6.9 million people found by a judge to be mentally ill. Without state laws mandating participation Montana and Wyoming have submitted 36 and 17 mental health records respectively. New Hampshire has submitted 657. By comparison Hawaii with about the same population as New Hampshire has submitted nearly 10000 mental health records. Records from the three states governmentrun mental health facilities show that many hundreds more people have been involuntarily committed all of whom should have been submitted into NICS. The national background check system was established as part of the 1993 Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Gun stores pawn shops and others licensed dealers nationwide must use it when someone wants to purchase a firearm.  Prospective gun buyers must fill out a form from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives attesting to certain questions then their name is run through the FBI system. The FBI says more than 300 million checks have been made over time leading to more than 2 million denials. Holes in the mental health reporting system gained attention in 2007 after a shooting at Virginia Tech left 32 dead. Two years earlier a court had found the student shooter an imminent danger to self or others after he was accused of stalking two female classmates resulting in temporary detention that should have disqualified him from purchasing firearms.  We know that a background check is only as good as the records it contains so efforts to improve reporting of records into NICS are critical for public safety said Kelly Drane research director with Giffords Law Center a gun violence prevention group. Research has shown that as states improve reporting of prohibiting mental health events into the background check system we see a reduced risk of violent crime arrest for individuals that are prohibited.  The National Shooting Sports Foundation continues to lobby in New Hampshire Montana and Wyoming to tighten up the reporting.  We are committed to ensuring the background check system reflects the most accurate data available said Mark Oliva the foundations spokesman. Efforts to broaden background checks to be universal applying to private sales have failed to pass at both state and federal levels. But gun rights lobbyists and gun safety groups both have coalesced around strengthening NICS.  Opposition to doing so has created some strange bedfellows said Susan Stearns executive director of the New Hampshire branch of the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Stearns group opposed a measure in 2017 to report mental illness to NICS largely because it did not include a way to get off the list. The alliance s position has always been If they re a danger to themselves or others they should be prevented from accessing lethal means period Stearns said. But you shouldn t lose Constitutional rights for your lifetime.  Stearns said people in a mental health crisis often recover yet could be permanently prevented from participating in shooting sports and hunting. New Hampshire officials submit court records for anyone deemed incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity but not those who are involuntarily committed to a health facility.  The alliance was lukewarm about a bill by former Democratic state Sen. Margie MacDonald in Montana too even though her bill included a pathway to be removed from the list after five years. MacDonald tried in 2014 and again in 2019 to pass a bill requiring that the records be submitted. Ultimately she said Republican opposition fueled by hardline gun rights groups in the state sunk her effort.  It s disheartening dismaying and very dangerous she said. MacDonald hosted a Virginia Tech victim s father for a 2014 hearing in Helena Montana. The mother of a woman killed in 2008 by a man who purchased a firearm just days after being involuntarily committed to a mental hospital testified as well. He had lied on the ATF s form answering no to whether he had ever been found to be mentally ill. Lying on the form can prompt fines and up to 10 years in prison. Burlingame said Wyoming s ranking as the worst place for suicides per capita is reason enough to keep firearms away from people in crisis.  This is tied to older white men isolated and having access to firearms Burlingame said. If that doesn t inspire people to create a culture that preserves our cultural right to firearms and moral obligations I don t know what will.  It s commonsense legislation that every other state has understood.  Nick Penzenstadler is a reporter on the USA TODAY investigations team.

He keeps a DSM5 on hand just in case. 2020 was the deadliest year in two decades for gun violence taking the lives of nearly 20000 Americans according to data from the Gun Violence Archive. As of this August 2021 is already deadlier with almost 29000 deaths taken by gun violence. If death by suicide is added in the numbers are greater. For instance the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC reports that nearly 24000 people died by firearm suicide in 2019. While most people who are violent do not suffer from mental illnesses and people with a mental illness are much more likely to be the victims rather than the perpetrators of violence a 2021 study published in the Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology found that many mass shooters in the United States were living with an untreated mental illness at the time they committed their crime.  The paper showed that people with schizophrenia are less violent than the rest of the population except if they re unmedicated. The mass shooters turn out to be people with psychiatric illness who are unmedicated Ira D. Glick MD lead researcher and professor emeritus of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford University School of Medicine tells Verywell.  After analyzing 35 mass shootings in the United States between 1982 and 2019 in which the shooters survived and went to trial Glick found that 28 shooters had mental illness diagnoses including  These should be referred to as brain illnesses rather than mental illnesses because mental illness covers so much ground says Glick. He adds that his research shows the need to find a way for people who are selling guns to make sure they don t get in the hands of people who have brain illness and don t want to take medicine.  OnlineTherapy.com surveyed 1250 American adults and found that 49 believe mental health assessments should be required by law for gun ownership.  An encouraging outcome of this recent research is observing an increasing connection being made by Americans that mental health matters when it comes to gun ownership and is an important consideration to prevent gun violence Danny Taylor RCC clinical counselor and addiction prevention specialist at OnlineTherapy.com tells Verywell. An encouraging outcome of this recent research is observing an increasing connection being made by Americans that mental health matters when it comes to gun ownership and is an important consideration to prevent gun violence  Ideally an assessment will help prevent guns from ending up in the hands of people whose mental health challenges might trigger great harm. The adage is that guns don t kill people people kill people. If this is true then mental health assessments will help us not only prevent gun violence but also help people who are struggling find support says Taylor. While the assessments would work by denying gun ownership to a person dealing with a serious mental health issue he hopes the process would simultaneously refer them to mental health support.  With referrals being practiced and better support in place we might see individuals in a much healthier and more responsible frame of mind to assume gun ownership in the future Taylor says. The survey found that 45 of people who object to mental health assessments believe it would violate the Second Amendment.  Gun ownership is more than a political issue it is a public health and safety issue. Mandated mental health assessments prior to gun ownership ensures collective accountability to support individuals and ensure safe communities says Taylor. Glick agrees noting that health assessments could save lives.  Something has to be done. Many people think who cares who is buying guns until someone in their own family gets killed then they care he says. Something has to be done. Many people think who cares who is buying guns until someone in their own family gets killed then they care. In terms of how a health assessment might look Taylor envisions an interdisciplinary diverse representation of Americans to develop and review the assessment criteria and methodology. He adds that the assessment should be regularly reviewed and edited to allow ongoing objective accountability.  Assessment tools could look like common selfreports utilized in the medical community. Selfreports might also occur in consultation with mental health professionals for a brief interview. On the subject of accountability I believe having an assessment done onsite at a gun seller is less ideal and can be compromised by profit motive says Taylor. Involving mental health professional services can provide objective expertise and support to potential gun owners as well as gun sellers he adds. While assumptions of mental illness and violence can lead to intolerance and stigma Taylor says understanding the facts can help develop more understanding attitudes towards mental health.  It is worth noting that violence from gun ownership also includes selfinfliction such as suicidality... Having ongoing mental health assessments for those wanting to own a lethal weapon can be a valuable step to ensure mental wellbeing and responsible ownership says Taylor. The more action society takes to support people with mental health challenges the better it can build community health and safety.  Gun ownership is an important responsibility and prioritizing mental health support is a valuable step in the direction of cultivating an accountable and supportive community says Taylor.  As for the argument that preventing nonviolent individuals with mental illness from owning a gun is not fair he says for the collective good in the face of continued mass shootings and gun violence in America mental health assessments are a worthwhile intervention.  Glick agrees stating that the obvious solution is to keep guns away from people who are severely mentally ill. However in addition to mandates he says teaching family and friends of those with serious brain illnesses how to find help for their loved ones may also make a difference.  A lot of times the families haven t forced their kids or spouses to get the help they need. They re acting paranoid and they don t know what to do to help them says Glick. As gun violence in the United States continues to increase law makers and the mental health community look for ways to protect the public. Many Americans believe requiring a mental health assessment might make a difference. Glick ID Cerfolio NE Kamis D Laurence M.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/mental-illness-gun-purchase/2021/05/27/a49cd232-bcb5-11eb-83e3-0ca705a96ba4_story.html, Walking into my local gun shop I found myself surrounded by walls of them and assaulted by an unwanted memory of a phone call I got in 2011 from my brother. Mom found Dad s body in the back seat of his car he told me with the receipt for the bullets.  That was the worst loss firearms had brought me but it wasn t the only one My childhood Sunday school teacher and three high school friends also took their own lives using guns. I cleared my throat and held tears at bay. I wanted to make this fast so I pointed to one of the neatly arrayed shotguns sleek and black. Oh the Benelli Nova! This here is a fan favorite. The salesman lifted the gun to his shoulder squinted his eye and pretended to aim at a target. I have a history of suicidal feelings and I was committed to a mental hospital in 2007 and in 2015. I absolutely should not own a gun. My entire body started to tremble.  The Benelli sounds great I told him. He tried to hand it to me and I just stared my hands glued to my sides. Here try it out! he urged. The gorgeous Benelli Nova.  Sweat dripped down my neck. I ve been in a psychiatric hospital I blurted. We can work that out he reassured me.  Twice I stuttered. I ve been in a mental hospital twice. I have a mental illness.  He paused looking me over as I stood there neatly dressed in my favorite blue blazer and cream linen pants. You don t look like someone who is mentally ill.  I don t know what he thought someone who is mentally ill would look like but of course you can t know a person s mental health from a glance. And yet a person s mental health has everything to do with whether they should own a gun. Disturbed I left the store without saying another word. My attempted purchase was a private social experiment As a mental health advocate I wanted to find out how likely it was that a person with my history could just walk into a store and buy a firearm. Five myths about guns On paper federal law prohibits selling a gun to anyone with a history of involuntary commitment to a mental health or substanceabuse treatment facility or whom a court has declared incompetent. This is supposed to be a lifetime ban though in some states people restricted from gun ownership can apply to have their rights restored. Licensed gun sellers by law must conduct background checks to screen out prohibited buyers. But mental health reporting laws vary state to state and federal law cannot require states to submit the relevant records to the government agencies that facilitate background checks. States can voluntarily submit this information but often fail to do so leaving the FBI s National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS database incomplete and inaccurate. In addition some 19 states and D.C. have redflag laws which allow law enforcement or family members to get court orders to block a person from accessing firearms if they pose a threat to themselves or others. Even so these laws are imperfect as was demonstrated yet again by the recent mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis. The 19yearold shooter legally purchased two semiautomatic rifles even after police had confiscated a shotgun from him in response to his mother s concerns about his mental state and her fear that he might attempt suicide by cop. The county prosecutor did not invoke the redflag law that could have prevented that purchase. He later told reporters that the law didn t allow his office enough time to subpoena the records that would build a winning case losing that case would require law enforcement to return the shotgun. The majority of states including Iowa where I live do not have such statutes. I decided to make my next attempted purchase at a national chain store a big box that sells items from farm and pet supplies to automotive parts to homeimprovement goods food clothing toys and of course firearms. The saleswoman took my driver s license as I filled out the federal form on a store computer. I carefully answered each question Had I ever been convicted of a felony? Do I use illegal drugs? Have I ever renounced my U.S. citizenship? I marked the no box for all of them until I came to the one asking whether I had ever been committed to a mental institution. I clicked the box marked yes and pressed submit.   You are unable to purchase a gun the saleswoman said kindly. I let out an enormous breath of relief. I must have failed the background check. Then she said You disqualified yourself. Since I d answered yes the law prohibited her from running the FBI background check. But if I had lied she added the system would have let me through. I have not had a person denied a gun purchase for mental health reasons she said. You would have passed.  From what I can tell she was right. In 2007 an emergency room doctor in Louisiana deemed me a danger to myself and involuntarily committed me to a psychiatric hospital. But between 1993 and 2013 Louisiana reported a mere four mental health records to the NICS. Currently the state does not report all involuntary commitments only those ordered by a court mine does not qualify. In addition neither my suicide attempt in 2015 nor my psychiatric stay in Missouri were required to be reported to the NICS database. Today the state still does not require such incidents to be reported to the FBI. You shouldn t have a gun until you are 25 research suggests. Not all psychiatric diagnoses should prohibit a gun purchase of course and stigmatizing mental illness is counterproductive and can distract from the larger conversation about reducing gun violence. Someone seeking elective therapy to treat depression anxiety or obsessivecompulsive disorder for example does not necessarily pose a risk to themselves or others. It should go without saying that people with mental illnesses are not inherently violent A 2019 study by the National Council for Mental Wellbeing found that the mentally ill commit 4 percent of all violent crime in the United States. But guns and mental illness can combine to have especially deadly consequences. According to that 2019 study about a third of mass shootings are carried out by people with a serious mental illness. The case for stricter guncontrol measures gets especially stark when we weigh the possibility that gun owners may harm themselves. Suicides account for some 60 percent of gun deaths in the United States outnumbering firearm homicides almost two to one. Ninety percent of those who attempt suicide with a gun die according to a study in the Annals of Internal Medicine whereas more than 95 percent of those who attempt suicide without a gun survive. Restricting access to firearms won t eliminate suicide the country s secondleading cause of death among teenagers and the 10thleading cause of death overall but it could save many lives. My experiment taught me that our system relies heavily on individuals to tell the truth about their mental health histories. That is a lot of responsibility to place on a person experiencing mental distress. If I had been even slightly more determined to buy a firearm if I d just kept quiet in front of the shop owner or clicked a different box I would have one right now. At the end of the day I went home without a gun. But I wish the law had stopped me. Read more from Outlook American cities have always regulated guns. Now most can t.

Getty Images This story was updated on Feb. 13 2024 at 1130 a.m. to clarify the position of Disability Rights CenterNH on House Bill 1711. A bill that would add certain mental health records to gun background checks to prevent people who are federally prohibited from buying guns from doing so has a great deal of support some of it key support.  One prime sponsor of House Bill 1711 is a Republican who opposes restricting Second Amendment rights. Three hundred people have submitted testimony backing it. Republican House leadership waived a filing deadline to let it move forward. Mental health and disability rights groups are supporting it. It is also facing significant resistance from gun rights groups and others some of whom have either misunderstood or misrepresented the legislation especially when it comes to the process for restoring a person s Second Amendment rights.  In response to concerns from the Disability Rights CenterNH and others the prime sponsor Rep. Terry Roy a Deerfield Republican proposed an amendment Friday. It remains unapproved because it has not been voted on by the House Criminal Justice and Public Safety Committee. Karen Rosenberg policy director for the Disability Rights CenterNH said the changes make the bill less discriminatory but not enough that her group would support the legislation. Instead if the changes are adopted the group would not oppose the bill she said.  It was genuinely one of the worst moments of my life   Here s how the process would work under Roy s amendment The bill would not cover people who are the subject of an involuntary emergency admission petition which usually involves a person going to an emergency room in crisis and being transferred to the state hospital or other psychiatric facility. The legislation applies only to people who are involuntarily admitted on a nonemergency basis. This means they have gone through a court hearing with the representation of a lawyer and a judge has found them to have a mental condition that makes them dangerous to themselves or others. In each case an individual can appeal to the state Supreme Court.  When someone is committed under those circumstances the court or the Department of Safety would have to report them to the federal National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS. But they would be allowed to provide only the person s name Social Security number date of birth and an identifier indicating they are prohibited under federal law from possessing a firearm. The Disability Rights CenterNH requested that language over concerns the initial version of the bill could have violated a person s right to privacy by providing unnecessary personal information. The bill allows a court to confiscate an individual s firearms and ammunition. Under changes requested by the Disability Rights CenterNH the court would have to tell the individual their guns may be taken by law enforcement. The individual could ask that they be stored with someone else other than a person they live with or by law enforcement.   The Disability Rights CenterNH and NAMI NH told lawmakers their support for the bill requires it includes a process for an individual to regain their Second Amendment rights.  Individuals found guilty by reason of insanity may petition a court for a review of their mental capacity a first step to being removed from NICS. In some cases they may do so 15 days after their absolute discharge meaning they are complying with treatment requirements. In other cases they must wait six months. Once a petition has been filed the court must schedule a hearing within 60 days and has up to 45 days to order an independent psychiatric examination. The psychiatrist must tell the court whether the individual is disabled by a mental illness or disability and is likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.  Following a hearing in which the individual can present evidence and call witnesses the court must request the person s information be removed from NICS if it finds by clear and convincing evidence the person will not be likely to act in a manner that is a danger to public safety and that granting the request to regain the right to possess a gun is not contradictory to the public interest.  If denied the individual could appeal to the state Supreme Court within 30 days. If the court upholds the denial the individual could not file a new petition for two years unless a court finds good cause for accessing a petition sooner.  by Annmarie Timmins New Hampshire Bulletin February 5 2024 by Annmarie Timmins New Hampshire Bulletin February 5 2024 This story was updated on Feb. 13 2024 at 1130 a.m. to clarify the position of Disability Rights CenterNH on House Bill 1711.

Under changes requested by the Disability Rights CenterNH the court would have to tell the individual their guns may be taken by law enforcement. The individual could ask that they be stored with someone else other than a person they live with or by law enforcement.   The Disability Rights CenterNH and NAMI NH told lawmakers their support for the bill requires it includes a process for an individual to regain their Second Amendment rights.  Individuals found guilty by reason of insanity may petition a court for a review of their mental capacity a first step to being removed from NICS. In some cases they may do so 15 days after their absolute discharge meaning they are complying with treatment requirements. In other cases they must wait six months. Once a petition has been filed the court must schedule a hearing within 60 days and has up to 45 days to order an independent psychiatric examination. The psychiatrist must tell the court whether the individual is disabled by a mental illness or disability and is likely to act in a manner dangerous to public safety.  Following a hearing in which the individual can present evidence and call witnesses the court must request the person s information be removed from NICS if it finds by clear and convincing evidence the person will not be likely to act in a manner that is a danger to public safety and that granting the request to regain the right to possess a gun is not contradictory to the public interest.  If denied the individual could appeal to the state Supreme Court within 30 days. If the court upholds the denial the individual could not file a new petition for two years unless a court finds good cause for accessing a petition sooner.

We re fighting every day for the laws policies and programs proven to save lives and bring an end to this uniquely American epidemic. Giffords Law Center works in all 50 states to change policies and challenge injustice. We won t rest until every state has strong gun safety laws and every community is free from the fear of gun violence.  Gun violence brings heartbreak to far too many communities. Giffords Center for Violence Intervention champions the strategies and organizations that break cycles of violence.  Giffords seeks to arm activists legislators and the general public with the facts about our country s gun violence epidemic and the most effective ways to address it.  We can t beat our country s gun violence epidemic if we don t work together. This fight requires our time and energy our voices and our votes. Don t sit this one out join us. Giffords is an organization dedicated to saving lives from gun violence. Led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords we inspire the courage of people from all walks of life to make America safer. To be effective background checks rely on a search of complete and accurate records to identify people who are legally prohibited from accessing guns. State laws requiring stakeholders to report records to the federal background check system are critical to ensuring the effectiveness of these background checks. Even in the wake of devastating tragedies such as the shooting at Virginia Tech in 2007 the system intended to limit access to firearms for individuals experiencing a mental health crisis still includes dangerous loopholes. With a more comprehensive system for reporting individuals and conducting background checks we can avoid putting guns in the hands of people who pose threats to themselves or others. Even though federal law prohibits the sale of firearms to certain individuals with a history of mental illness history has shown that it s still too easy for people experiencing a mental health crisis to obtain firearms. Currently laws are in place that require licensed dealers but not unlicensed sellers to conduct a background check prior to the transfer of a firearm to screen out these and other prohibited purchasers.1 Sep 13 2018 However federal law cannot require states to make information identifying these people available to the federal or state agencies that perform background checks2 and many states fail to voluntarily report the necessary records to the FBI s National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS especially with respect to people prohibited from possessing guns for mental health reasons. As a result some individuals known to pose a serious risk to themselves and others can pass background checks and obtain firearms. The most tragic incident involving a state s failure to report mental health records occurred in April 2007 when Virginia Tech student SeungHui Cho shot and killed 32 people and injured 17 others before committing suicide on the college campus in Blacksburg Virginia. Cho was in fact prohibited from purchasing a firearm under federal law because of a history of mental illness.3 However the unstable gunman was able to purchase firearms through two licensed dealers after two background checks. While Virginia law at that time required that some mental health records be submitted to the databases used for background checks it did not require reporting of all people prohibited from possessing firearms for mental health reasons. Other mass shootings including those in Tucson AZ on January 8 2011 in Aurora CO on July 20 2012 and in Newtown CT on December 14 2012 have also resulted in renewed calls for better laws addressing guns and mental illness. Our nation s leaders including President Obama have joined these calls4 and states have begun to respond. Since the Virginia Tech shooting about half of the states have enacted laws authorizing and requiring the submission of mental health records to NICS as described below. States that have enacted such laws have in fact subsequently submitted greater numbers of records. Of the states that had submitted the top 15 highest numbers of records as of May 2013 14 93 had enacted such laws while only two of the 15 poorest performing states 13 had enacted such laws.7 Despite the huge increase in the number of individuals identified in NICS records of many individuals prohibited from possessing firearms because of their mental health histories are still missing from the database. The greatest gains in the numbers of state records submitted to NICS largely reflect the efforts of a small minority of states8 and as of November 2013 12 states had still submitted fewer than 100 records each.9 When mental health information is submitted to NICS it can be effective at preventing firearm transfers by licensed dealers to ineligible people.  In 2005 of the total number of prospective purchasers who were denied following an FBI background check only 0.5 were denied for mental health reasons.10 By 2017 this number had risen 6.4.11 Mental health records in the system blocked 316 gun sales in Virginia in 2013. This represents a 47 increase from 2010 before Virginia had increased its reporting of such records.12 In 2007 Connecticut began reporting people who were prohibited from possessing firearms because of a history of mental illness to the background check system. The number of violent crimes committed by these people then fell by half.13 Although some states have cited a concern for privacy as a reason that records have not been submitted to NICS the mental health records submitted to NICS only identify the individuals through names birth dates and similar data and include no clinical information.14 In addition as described below access to information in NICS is tightly controlled. Federal law and regulations generally prohibit people from selling or otherwise transferring a firearm or ammunition to any person who at age 16 or older States may prohibit additional categories of people from purchasing or possessing firearms on the basis of mental illness. Detailed information on these laws is contained in our summary on Firearm Prohibitions. We re in this together. To build a safer America one where children and parents in every neighborhood can learn play work and worship without fear of gun violence we need you standing beside us in this fight. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act the Brady Act requires licensed dealers to request a background check prior to transfer of a firearm.17 Background checks are performed through a search of NICS.18 For more general information about background check requirements see our summary on Background Check Procedures. NICS includes four federal databases. Two of these the Interstate Identification Index III and the NICS Index contain records that may identify a person as disqualified from possessing firearms on the basis of an adjudication regarding an individual s mental or developmental disability. The Interstate Identification Index includes information that states have reported to the FBI as part of their criminal history records such as findings of not guilty by reason of insanity or incompetence to stand trial. However most state records that are in NICS and disqualify a person due to a mental healthrelated adjudication exist in the NICS Index not the III. Federal law does not require states to submit information to NICS participation is strictly voluntary.19However effective background checks on prospective firearm purchasers depend on the existence of complete accurate information in the NICS database. Therefore to fully capture all records that would disqualify someone under federal law from purchasing or possessing firearms due to mental illness or developmental disability it is critical that state authorities report to NICS whenever a court board or other lawful authority In January 2008 President Bush signed into law the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 which among other things In June 2022 President Biden signed into law the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act24 which among other things requires NICS to contact the state custodian of mental health adjudication records whenever an FFL contacts the system to run a background check on a person under age 21 attempting to buy a firearm.25 The mental health repository has three business days to identify whether a potentially disqualifying record under 18 U.S.C. 922d exists for the prospective buyer including any record that at age 16 or older the individual was adjudicated as a mental defective or committed to any mental institution. 26 If a potentially disqualifying record for the prospective buyer exists NICS has ten business days from when the FFL first contacted the system to determine whether the buyer is disqualified from possessing a firearm. The FFL may not transfer the firearm until it receives notification that the transfer may proceed i.e. the prospective buyer is eligible to purchase a firearm or the ten business days have passed.  These provisions which only apply if the gun buyer is under age 21 will expire on September 30 2032 unless Congress renews them.27 As described in our policy summary on NICS and Reporting Procedures federal departments or agencies which have information about people prohibited from possessing firearms must submit records to the Attorney General for inclusion in NICS. This includes people who have become subject to the mental health prohibitor.28 In addition every federal department or agency that makes any adjudication regarding a person s mental health or imposes commitment to a mental institution must have a program that allows individuals to petition for relief from the disabilities imposed by this adjudication or commitment.29 This relief process allows people who have become prohibited from possessing firearms to regain their firearms eligibility. When a person submits a petition for relief the department or agency decides whether or not to restore the individual s eligibility to purchase and possess guns. The department or agency must process an application for relief within 365 days.30 Decisions on relief petitions are subject to judicial review.31 Every federal department or agency that commits or adjudicates a person in a way that would disqualify the person from purchasing or possessing guns under federal law must provide both oral and written notice to the individual at the commencement of the process. This notice must inform the person that if the agency adjudicates or commits the person in this way the person will be prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. The notice must also inform the person about the federal penalties for unlawful possession of a firearm. Finally the notice must inform the person about the availability of the relief from disabilities process noted above.32 Federal and state privacy laws are sometimes erroneously cited as the reason some states do not provide complete mental healthrelated records to the FBI.33 However federal regulations include protections to ensure the privacy and security of mental health records that have been submitted to NICS. Access to data stored in NICS is limited to use in firearm purchaser background checks and other closely related law enforcement activities such as the issuance of firearmsrelated permits and enforcement activities by ATF and safeguards protect against unauthorized disclosures.34 Furthermore the federal Health Insurance and Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 HIPAA and implementing regulations restrict disclosure of protected health information only by healthcare plans providers and clearinghouses.35 In addition HIPAA and its regulations permit any disclosure made In January 2016 the Department of Health and Human Services finalized an amendment to the HIPAA Privacy Rules to directly address mental health reporting to NICS. The new rule explicitly states that certain entities may report certain identifying information to NICS and state agencies that report to NICS.37 Fortyseven states have laws that require or authorize relevant stakeholders to report relevant information identifying people who become prohibited from accessing firearms due to a mental healthrelated adjudication or commitment to the federal NICS database or a state database for use in firearm purchaser background checks. As described below the scope of these reporting requirements vary as do the specific procedures and requirements involved. The following states laws explicitly authorize but do not require reporting to NICS The following states laws acknowledge that they collect mental health records for use in firearm purchaser background checks although these laws do not address disclosure to NICS Most of these states require courts to report mental health information to a centralized state agency in connection with firearm purchaser background checks.85 Most state laws requiring stakeholders to report records regarding firearmprohibiting mental health adjudications are limited to individuals who have been subject to specified state mental health inpatient commitment procedures. However as described below a number of states have broader record reporting requirements. About onethird of the states identify at least some of the records that must be reported by referencing those individuals who are subject to federal andor state firearm prohibitions. Four states Illinois Nebraska New Jersey and Pennsylvania explicitly include in their record reporting laws all individuals who are prohibited from possessing firearms due to their mental condition under federal or state law. Other states explicitly reference only the federal law and require reporting of records for all individuals who are subject to any federal firearm prohibition. All the states mentioned in this summary include within their reporting requirements at least some people confined to mental health treatment facilities as inpatients although the length of the required commitment varies. Most of these laws only involve people who have been subject to formal involuntary commitment processes although there are exceptions. Florida for instance enacted a law in 2013 that requires reporting of a voluntarily committed person if a judge or magistrate has classified the person as a danger to self or others because the examining physician certified that a petition for involuntary commitment would have been filed if the person had not consented to treatment.86 About half of the states specifically authorize or require that records be reported to state or federal background check systems for all individuals found not guilty by reason of insanity or who are found guilty but insane in a criminal case. Additional states may report these individuals records through broader criminal history reporting laws. About half the states specifically authorize or require the reporting of any person found incompetent to stand trial. Again additional states may report these individuals through their criminal history reporting laws. Gun violence is a complex problem and while there s no onesizefitsall solution we must act. Our reports bring you the latest cuttingedge research and analysis about strategies to end our country s gun violence crisis at every level. Reporting relevant records regarding mental healthrelated adjudications and commitments for the purposes of firearm background checks is usually a twostep process with certain exceptions as described below. Courts or mental health institutions usually report information to a centralized state agency and the state agency may then forward the information to NICS andor other law enforcement agencies that conduct background checks. The following states utilize reports from mental health treatment facilities about individuals who have fallen into federal or state categories of prohibited firearm purchasers for firearm purchaser background checks In some of these states this reporting takes the place of reporting by courts in other states this reporting adds to reporting done by courts. In California in addition to reporting by mental health facilities if a person communicates to a licensed psychotherapist a serious threat of physical violence against a reasonably identifiable victim or victims state law requires the psychotherapist to report the person s identity to local law enforcement which must in turn report the information to the California Department of Justice for the purposes of firearm purchaser background checks.87 New York adopted a law in 2013 that requires a mental health professional to report any person receiving treatment who is likely to engage in conduct that would result in serious harm to self or others this information may be used to determine firearms eligibility and must be destroyed after five years.88 Illinois enacted a law in 2013 requiring reporting by any physician clinical psychologist qualified examiner law enforcement official or the primary administrator for any school who determines that a person presents a clear and present danger to self or others including any person determined to demonstrate threatening physical or verbal behavior.89 Two states Illinois and Connecticut have enacted laws requiring certain state agencies to enter into a Memorandum of Understanding MOU with the FBI regarding submittal of information to NICS. In this context MOUs are written agreements that set forth the responsibilities of the various agencies and ensure that the mental health information submitted to NICS will only be utilized for firearmrelated background checks. In Connecticut the state s Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection Department of Mental Health and Addiction Services and Judicial Department were required to enter into an MOU with the FBI for the purpose of implementing NICS. Similarly both the Illinois Department of State Police and the Department of Human Services were required to enter into an MOU with the FBI for this purpose. The following states laws require courts agencies or mental health officials to report relevant information regarding mental health adjudications and commitments within a specified time frame As noted above some states have only recently begun reporting people who are prohibited from possessing firearms because of mental illness. As a result a large number of people are prohibited from possessing firearms because of a prior adjudication or commitment but records regarding their adjudications or commitments have never been reported to relevant background check systemts. A small number of states have undertaken the task of identifying these people from old court records in order to report them to NICS or other databases. For example in 2009 Texas enacted a law requiring courts to search through and submit 20 years worth of records by September 1 201090 making Texas a leader in the number of records submitted to NICS.91 Similarly Minnesota enacted a law in 2013 that requires courts to enter all persons civilly committed during the period from January 1 1994 to September 28 2010 into NICS by July 1 2014.92 South Carolina also enacted a law in 2013 that requires courts to search back through a minimum of ten years worth of records to identify individuals to be reported.93 A number of states require applicants for firearm licenses or persons seeking to purchase firearms to authorize disclosure of mental health information. For more information about these laws see our summary on Background Check Procedures. The features listed below are intended to provide a framework from which policy options may be considered. A jurisdiction considering new legislation should consult with counsel.  Universal background checks are essential to close deadly loopholes in our laws that allow millions of guns to end up in the hands of individuals at an elevated risk of committing violence each year.   Extreme risk protection orders provide a proactive way to stop mass shootings and other tragedies by temporarily intervening to suspend a person s access to firearms if they show clear warning signs of violence.   Comprehensive reporting improves our existing background checks system and keeps guns out of the hands of individuals at an elevated risk of committing violence.   2024Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.
