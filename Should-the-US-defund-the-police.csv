Quaker action for a just world  Take the Pledge Think Twice Before Calling the Police In the aftermath of the police murder of George Floyd protests erupted in Minneapolis and across the U.S. with activists and community members demanding that Black lives matter and with many calling to defund the police.  Many of us particularly white people have been taught to equate policing with public safety and can t imagine alternatives to a punitive law enforcement model. But our criminal legal system was built to reinforce deep structural racism in our society. For most individuals and communities of color policing has brought terror rather than safety.  The murders of George Floyd Eric Garner Philando Castile Sandra Bland Michael Brown and countless other Black and Brown people at the hands of police are not anomalies. They are evidence of a racist system that disproportionately targets people of color for violence imprisonment and death. We need real change. That s why we must stop investing in police and incarceration and instead intentionally invest in alternative models that are centered in community and address the root causes of harm in addition to making greater investments in schools health care and other human needs that keep our communities safe.  Here is why we should all support the call to defund the police  The police are not a neutral body and the institution is inherently biased. In the U.S. slave patrols and night watches were the beginning of a racially directed system of law enforcement designed to secure capital for white settlers.  Over the past 40 years the expansion of racially targeted policing and policies such as stopandfrisk and the war on drugs have helped fuel mass incarceration in the U.S. with AfricanAmericans incarcerated at more than five times the rate of white people. Black and Brown people are disproportionately targeted from a young age with hundreds of thousands of children ages six to 14 arrested often by police officers stationed in schools as school resource officers.  Police forces have also become more militarized. Since 1990 the federal government has transferred 6 billion of excess military equipment to local law enforcement agencies under its 1033 Program giving police access to mineresistant vehicles assault rifles and grenade launchers. For years police have also undergone warrior training that teaches them to see every encounter as potentially lifethreatening especially when those encounters involve people of color. Every year onduty police kill an estimated 1000 people.  What s more a recent study revealed that hundreds of active duty officers from across the country are members of racist and antigovernment groups on Facebook. Despite the billions of dollars spent every year on policing more than 15000 people were killed by gun violence in 2019 alone disproportionately young people of color. If policing and imprisonment stopped violence the U.S. would be the most peaceful country in the world. But decades of evidence show us this is not the case.  If we believe in everyone s right to live in safety and peace we need to dismantle institutions that were never intended to get us there and free up resources for solutions that are actually designed to create healthy safe sustainable communities.  In Minneapolis and other U.S. cities body cameras and other reform measures were implemented as part of the Obama administration s multimilliondollar response to the call for police accountability and have proven largely ineffective.  Meanwhile police murders continue with 1002 people shot and killed by police already this year. U.S. cities collectively spend 100 billion a year on policing while needed investments in education health care housing and other critical programs go unfulfilled particularly in poor communities and communities of color. New York City for instance spends more on policing than it does on the Departments of Health Homeless Services Housing Preservation and Development and Youth and Community Development combined.  Our tax dollars must be reallocated from this system that regularly murders Black people with impunity and instead invested in programs that strengthen our communities.  As part of its platform the Movement for Black Lives calls for the reallocation of federal state and local government funds from policing and incarceration to longterm strategies for education restorative justice services and employment programs.  In Chicago the NoCopAcademy campaign galvanized thousands of community members and garnered the support of more than 100 community organizations in urging the city to shift funding for a new 95 million police academy to programs that benefit youth and communities.  Faced with budget shortfalls and urgent health care needs at least 13 cities have made cuts to their police budgets. That includes funding health care workers to respond to mental health emergencies instead of the police. It also means shifting our resources to transformative justice approaches that support survivors and work directly with the person who has caused harm through communitybased systems of accountability. Under these models community members work together to keep each other safe. The human costs of investing in policing instead of our communities have been social as well as financial. We have created a society that looks to policing as the answer to our problems both real and imagined calling the police not only in emergencies but also in response to white people s fears or annoyance in many situations where people of color are simply trying to live their lives.  Defunding police is one step we can take to free up resources and public imagination for more just and humane approaches to community safety and shared wellbeing. It s time to defund the police.

Amid the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis Minnesota on May 25 2020 calls to defund the police began to populate protest signs and social media posts.  While there are multiple interpretations of defund the police the basic definition is to move funding away from police departments and into community resources such as mental health experts housing and social workers. In the larger scope of the civil rights movement some advocates would reallocate some police funding but keep police departments others would combine defunding with other police reforms such as body cameras and bias training and others see defunding as a small step toward ultimately abolishing police departments and the prison system entirely.  According to the most recent data available police departments received about 114.5 billion nationwide in 2017 from state and local governments up from 42.3 billion in 1977. Police budgets have made up around 4 of total state and local budgets since 1977. About 97 of police budgets go toward operational costs such as salaries and benefits. However individual cities or counties may allocate more funds to police departments. The 2017 Los Angeles city budget for example provided 23 of the budget to police while 9 of Los Angeles county s budget went to policing.  64 of Americans oppose the abstract idea of defunding the police while 34 support the movement. 60 are against reallocating police budget funds to other public health and social programs while 39 are in favor.  In Oct. 2021 21 of American adults wanted police budgets increased a lot and 26 wanted budgets increased a little while 9 wanted police budgets decreased a little and 6 decreased a lot. 37 said budgets should stay about the same.

https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2021/7/demonizing-and-defunding-police-has-consequences, American communities are less safe today than they were a year ago. Crime rates have surged since defund the police became a rallying cry. It s no coincidence that cities that have slashed their police budgets have seen huge increases in violence. As of the end of May Portland Oregon was on track to exceed 1000 shootings for this year. In the first 14 weeks of 2021 New York City shootings were up 81 percent. In Oakland California carjackings are up almost 88 percent. Unfortunately these are just a few examples.  The crime surge is real and it is frightening. Statistics and percentages can seem abstract but there are people behind every one of those crimes. People whose lives have been cut short or ravaged by violence. People whose sense of safety has been destroyed. This won t be a surprise to most South Dakotans who overwhelmingly support our law enforcement officers but defunding the police is a terrible idea. Some of the cities that cut their own police funding are even recognizing the mistake they ve made and seeking to restore funding they cut. Unfortunately the problem won t necessarily be fixed that easily. Because the defund the police movement has not just resulted in smaller police budgets it has also resulted in lower police morale leading to a wave of police retirements and resignations. Now police departments are worried about having enough officers to keep their communities safe. It turns out that when you spend months vilifying police officers and demonizing them for doing their jobs some of them no longer want to stay. To me this is perhaps the worst consequence of the defund the police movement. Resources and equipment can be built back up again but it s a lot harder to replace good seasoned officers particularly right now when it s difficult to imagine why anyone would want to become a police officer. Why would men and women sign up for a job where they are regularly characterized as the worst kind of criminals? The sickening scene of protesters shouting death to police outside a hospital where two ambushed law enforcement officers were fighting for their lives has to be emblazoned on the minds of police officers nationwide. The defund the police movement unjustly paints the entire law enforcement community as corrupt and immoral. We all know that simply isn t true. Police officers are heroes in their communities brave and committed Americans who put on the badge each day knowing the risk to their own safety. These are the people we call when we have a car accident see someone in trouble or in need or fear for our safety. These are the people who run toward danger and violence when the natural reaction is to run away from it. Our law enforcement officers deserve the highest level of respect. Now are there bad police officers out there? Of course there are. There are bad teachers out there too. And bad social workers. And bad businessmen. But just as it would be outrageous to demonize all teachers because of the few bad apples in their profession it is outrageous to demonize the hundreds of thousands of dedicated Americans defending public safety because of a handful of bad officers.  We owe our men and women in law enforcement a great debt a debt we can t even fully comprehend. These men and women go out and risk their lives every day of the week every month of the year to keep us safe. And they bear a heavy physical and emotional burden. It s tough to have to see evil on a daily basis to spend years rescuing children who are in trouble or supporting victims of violence or bringing rapists to justice. They confront violence so that we don t have to and they pay a price. We owe them and their families our profound gratitude.  Democrats bear a substantial amount of responsibility for this situation. Far too many of them actively supported the defund the police movement and encouraged resentment toward law enforcement. It is disgraceful that antipolice rhetoric has become such an accepted part of our national conversation and has been winked at or endorsed by so many Democrat leaders. We owe our police officers much better. If any good can come out of all this violence and heartbreak I hope it s increased recognition of how essential police officers are to keeping our communities safe and a rejection of any idea of defunding the police. It s time to focus on protecting public safety and honoring the men and women who spend every day working to promote it.

During the summer of 2020 no issue was debated more than the subject of defunding the police. The phrase defund the police DTP became a rallying cry for the progressive left. Yet while the movement gained considerable news coverage the two major political parties media and major presidential candidates labeled defunding the police as an unrealistic demand. This mischaracterization of the movement is not based on fact but rather fear. In this article we address seven common myths associated with the campaign with the goal to demonstrate that while some have labeled it a radical movement the DTP philosophy is based on wellresearched evidencebased positions.  One of the most misleading critiques of the movement is instigating defund means abolish. Opposers claim the movement undermines public safety through its efforts to end policing. The truth the movement seeks to demilitarize police departments and reallocate funding to trained mental health workers and social workers to reduce unnecessary violent encounters between police and citizens. At least 13 cities in the United States have currently engaged in policy programs to defund the police. Another misconception is that police forces are what maintains order. However studies have found that the best tools to establish peaceful societies are equity in education and infrastructure. Indeed research shows that lack of education and illiteracy are some of the most significant predictors of future prison populations. Myth 3 Police Protect the Public From Violence Critics of the police movement assert that we need heavily funded and armed police forces to protect the public from violent criminal elements. However there isn t sufficient data to support that position. In fact research has found that the police don t have a notoriously efficient track record of solving violent crime. Further what the research does show is that 70 of robberies 66 of rapes 47 of aggravated assaults and 38 of murders go unsolved each year. Myth 4 Community Programs Won t Work While much of the available research contradicts the narrative that policing is essential to eliminating crime substantial evidence shows that investing developing and supporting education and economic programs do in fact lead to less offenses and create more social harmony. Education has long been viewed as the great equalizer. Data supports the position that individuals that receive a quality education are less likely to become involved in the criminal justice system. Myth 5 Most Police Work is Focused on Crime Prevention There is minimal evidence that police surveillance results in reduced crime or prevents crime. For instance research showed 90 of the people that were stopped in the NYPD s controversial stop and frisk program were not committing any crime. While it is true that police do apprehend individuals that violate the law this is one of several components of their responsibilities. Myth 6 Police Officers Do Not Need College Degrees Research shows police officers that have at least two years of a college education are less likely to have misconduct complaints and less likely to use force to gain compliance. And officers with only high school diplomas account for 75 of disciplinary problems. The evidence shows reform efforts should not ignore the application pool crisis and law enforcement departments should instill more robust higher education standards. Myth 7 Defunding the Police is a KneeJerk Reaction With No Research Some opponents of cutting police budgets view the movement as an emotional response to police misconduct rather than a wellthoughtout campaign. However a study with 60 years of data indicates that increases in spending do not reduce crime. Which begs the question how is 60 years of a failed objective any better? Yes the movement gained attention because of tragic events in 2020 but the evidence supporting the movement is based on hard data and proven methods. Police reform is long overdue and we have had thousands of opportunities to make the appropriate changes. In 2020 the murder of George Floyd garnered national attention that has caused many to take a long hard look at our democratic systems cultural identities and the necessary steps towards equal protection. We do know that more traditional policing is not the answer. No matter what we choose to call it defund the police a reallocation of funding or a total reimagination research supports a public health approach to policing. If we are effective funding public health approaches will reduce the reliance on lawandorder policing save lives and reverse the longstanding slide in the wrong direction. Police must be the last resort used only when necessary to protect the public from harm. Until then municipalities will need to prepare for the impact of increased police accountability and transparency. Ultimately the rising costs associated with police misconduct will force police reform a cost that would have been much cheaper had we listened to those groups most impacted by aggressive policing. To see real change in our society policymakers must remove the barriers and fund necessary programming. We need not raise taxes. We simply need to be smart and follow the science.

https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/09/the-question-of-defunding-police/671352/, Last week I asked readers for their thoughts on Joe Biden s plan to hire 100000 additional police officers and his explicit rejection of defunding the police.  Defunding the police would be foolhardy and dangerous. Having a wellfunded police force is in many large cities in America the bulwark against crime violence and mayhem. In addition the police serve many valuable societal functions besides stemming crime. When I was a paramedic in a former life it was the police who responded to and were responsible for securing every scene I was on. They performed welfare checks on citizens whose relatives were worried maintained traffic safety and a whole host of other beneficial things. If someone is breaking into your house or menacing your family who are you going to call a social worker? A psychologist? All that said I am as appalled as anyone by the many instances of police violence against Black people and other minorities under the guise of enforcing the law or keeping the peace. A much larger share of their funding should go toward education training and psychological testing and treatment. The police are a microcosm of our society both good and bad and we all see the rage hatred and prejudice playing out every day across America and the world. Don t defund the police just fund the right parts of policing. Read 1990s policing Overrated or underrated? I am no fan of the police. I do not recall a single time a police officer served me or protected me. My Black husband and I have been harassed and treated poorly by police more times than we can recall so these are incidents that stand out in my memory We were driving in Chicago one snowy night when the sign No Right Turn on Red Light 1 3 a.m. was covered by snow. We made a right turn and then heard the siren and saw the lights behind us. We pulled over a policeman told my husband he was under arrest. He asked what for. The cop replied that he had made an illegal turn. The two of them walked back to the intersection and saw that the sign was snowcovered. My husband protested and the cop called for a paddy wagon. My husband was taken to jail.  I followed in our car. When I entered the police station I was greeted with Here s your whore. I asked what the charges were. They said None. He can go. Another time we had gone to Cleveland for a football game. We were staying at a fine hotel. When we went downstairs to go to dinner my husband realized he had forgotten his car keys. He told me to wait in the bar until he got back. A man at the bar told me to suck his dick like I did that n . I told my husband when he returned and he took a step toward the bar. The man twirled on his stool and punched my husband in the face. He didn t stop there he kept pummeling him. The bartender called the police and reported a race riot in progress. When the police arrived the fight had moved to the lobby. The police told us we had to leave the hotel. Observers told the police the other guy had started the whole thing. The police left telling the man to keep his fists to himself but not that he needed to leave. In Reno we lived in a house across the street from a state policeman. His daughter and ours were the same age and played together until he came home one day and saw our daughter and his playing in his front yard. He had fits and forbade his daughter to have anything to do with ours. Several months later police knocked on our door and said they received a notice that my husband was burglarizing the neighborhood. It was about 1 a.m. My husband had gone to the door in his bathrobe followed by our dog. Our Porsche was in the driveway. He told the police that unless they could show him a warrant for a Black man in a bathrobe with a dog driving a Porsche and burglarizing in Reno he was going to file a complaint with the communityrelations bureau. They left. Finally here in California my car was hit by another car being driven in an adjoining lane. I was driving. When the sheriff arrived at my window his first question was Who was really driving?  I once taught at a college which had a police academy. Until 3 years before I retired there were no nonwhite male cadets and I had some of those cadets in my classes. I have no hope that any of them are working to eradicate the racism that pervades many police departments. I say don t fund the police Fund mandatory personality profiles as a condition of hiring and intense diversity training after hiring until the racists are weeded out. My dad was a police officer from the late 1980s to 2019. My thoughts on policing have always been through the eyes of a son who worried about his dad when he left for work. On September 10 2001 he was on his police motorbike when he was hit by a drunk driver and almost lost a leg. He later moved on to work in an affluent suburb. He ended his career a K9 officer. The first few years of his career he spent walking a publichousing beat in an urban police department so strapped for cash that he had to purchase his own firearm. His fondest memories of policing came from that beat where he knew the folks who sat on the stoop and hung out. If they were drinking alcohol he would tell them to put it in a paper bag. He says that once a member of the community talked back to him but before my dad could say anything the person s group told him to be nice to my dad because they knew him they trusted him. Nowadays I walk around D.C. where I live or in Michigan where I grew up and if I see police they are likely scrolling on their phones sitting in their airconditioned cars. My dad had a degree in criminal science from Kent State. Nowadays he believes departments lower employment standards to keep a full force but that has negative consequences. He also constantly denied promotions offered to him not wanting to be involved with the politics of police leadership and city government. Police spend so much time on conflict resolution and things that Americans can t seem to do themselves. Cities without mentalhealth services rely on police to solve them. We have injected police into schools leading to more arrests and detentions of juveniles because schools are incapable of meeting students emotional needs. When someone steals food because they cannot afford to eat we toss them in jail instead of getting them help. We ask the police to do so much. When I hear defund the police I think about moving that money into the city services that could address the problems that police are unequipped and I d argue unwilling to handle. My biggest issue with policing today is the cost of police misconduct. A FiveThirtyEight analysis shows that in the past 10 years 3 billion dollars have been spent settling misconduct civil cases. Where does that money come from? Most often the city budget. Not the police budget the city budget. If their expensive misconduct is subsidized by the very community they protect and serve then what is the point of policing? We can hire all the cops we want but will it really solve the most pressing issues? I say no and a deeper investment in other civil projects would be of better use. I m a liberal through and through and something that I m old enough to remember most liberal and nonliberals agreeing on was the primary need for incarceration punishment and removal from the streets of those who broke not just our laws but the public trust. The tremendous reduction in U.S. violent crime in the 90s and 00s provided the luxury I would say to tinker with this model but rather than tinker my fellow liberals and our progressive fellow travelers ridiculously overcorrected to the point where especially in our larger cities it s now exceptionally easy to break a law and not get caught or to get caught and not be punished in any way. We can see where this is leading and the desirability of police work is plummeting as a result with our safety alongside it.  Rootcause analysis is important and should be left to those who know what they re doing not to activists. More important the job of America s district attorneys police and politicians is to catch and prosecute those who break the law that s it end of story. Alex defends the defund the police wing of the Black Lives Matter movement BLM doesn t want a world with gang violence crime death shootings extortions etc. They want a world where their fathers their sons get to stay alive get to stay as part of their family get to live and thrive. They can t do that in prison. BLM supporters view the actions of the police as the most targetable source of the murder and suffering they face on a daily basis. They see the cure as worse than the condition of the daily violence they live with as so much overkill the way white people might imagine the idea of calling in SWAT to break up a playground dispute between elementary schoolers. As a 75yearold lifelong New Yorker who has seen this city in numerous permutations at its nadir and best I can say unequivocally that 90s zerotolerance policing was the best thing that ever happened here. Bill Bratton Ray Kelly and their ilk are needed and the city would do its best to keep them cloned indefinitely. One felt safe mostly everywhere. Read 19 readers on Donald Trump s legal future David shares conclusions that he came to while working in the legal system There are many situations that escalate due to citizens not understanding or caring how police are trained. In general they are trained to escalate force quickly to gain control over potentially volatile situations. They are not trained to engage in negotiations with recalcitrant suspects to secure compliance. Thus verbal commands give way to control holds which give way to chemical agents batons Tasers which give way to deadly force and officers need not try every step along the way. They are legally entitled to use force that an objectively reasonable officer could have deemed necessary if placed in the same position and judging from the position of the officer at the scene not with 2020 hindsight. The upshot is that the failure of a person with the physical capacity to threaten an officer s safety to follow police commands can quickly lead to serious injury from a takedown baton strikes or worse. Police are trained to be very wary of potential threats and the Second Amendment justifies their caution given the prevalence of firearms in the citizenry. If a reasonable officer could have felt the need to use the same level of force as an officer who injured someone then the injured person will have no legal recourse for their injuries and the officer will not face internal discipline. It can be extremely difficult to hold police accountable for alleged misconduct in conservative jurisdictions where jurors and judges are more likely to side with police than injured suspects. Cellphones and body cameras may be leveling the playing field but not all encounters are recorded. It is not always easy to find competent legal counsel willing and able to take on public entities on behalf of flawed clients. Most officers have civilservice protection and skilled legal representation in civilservice proceedings over proposed discipline so departments cannot always discipline wayward officers. But defunding the police is a terrible idea. Since when does paying people less improve their performance? While police reform is a slow process most successful changes are incremental not radical. Demoralizing the police is not a great way to motivate them to protect and serve. While they should do their jobs if they are understaffed lots of retirements and resentful they probably won t do it effectively as Portland and Seattle are finding out. To sum up officers do need to be held more accountable for actual misconduct and steps should be taken to try to eliminate officers covering for each other. However the public and the press need to better understand what constitutes actionable police misconduct before sensationalizing every act of police violence especially before all evidence is known. Fast coverage is rarely good coverage. Vilifying officers for lawful conduct creates a siege mentality justifying their impulse to cover for each other. In 2018 I got involved with my local legislative district s Democratic Party. Seattle was a community in upheaval. As our resident tech employers began to really grow our economy and population was overwhelmed. Everything became ludicrously expensive and the city built for a simpler and less populous time was in no position to absorb the shock. Along with the boom came spikes in our homeless population and our middle class got squeezed harder and harder. People working service jobs couldn t afford to live near where they worked. Developers began putting in communal living buildings where impoverished young workers and students could eke out a life in tiny studios with shared kitchens and bathrooms. The chemical composition of meth changed during that time too and those who struggled with drugs became more addled faster. Crime spiked. Homelessness exploded. Our city was great and it was suffering all at the same time. Against this backdrop consider the Seattle Police Department. Despite Seattle s reputation as a liberal bastion its police department was a far cry from the light on crime reputation cities like ours carried. The department has had a long history of abusive practices and poor accountability. Eventually well before George Floyd died they entered a consent decree with the Justice Department. I got to see how that played out firsthand when a bank I worked at was subpoenaed by the department. The detective informed me that he needed the bank s footage of an arrest because the consent decree required them to provide oversight over rough arrests. It was an illuminating conversation. So the police had issues. But by the time I got into local politics things were hitting a nadir. Policing was our city s solution for seemingly every problem. With a budget of 400 million per year police were asked to address every call related to homelessness including loitering and moving people who were just incredibly high and angry and every domestic call to record every vehicle breakin and of course to investigate every major crime. Police morale was horrible. Their retention rate was and continues to be abysmal. Their reputation and their relationship with our community was extremely tense. Petty crime and major crimes were and are all up. Essentially every possible stakeholder the community the police and the government were all miserable and by every possible metric. My congressional district was one of the most liberal and democratic in the country. Our representative in Congress is Pramila Jayapal for reference. So after George Floyd died I had thought that the time was ripe for us to finally make some changes. I argued that we ought to dissolve the SPD and create a new publicsafety agency which would report to the county executive instead of the city. We would not only leverage the larger resources of King County but we would also invest way more in public safety my initial estimate was in the ballpark of 200 million the city s budget was 6 billion at the time. The new Public Safety Service would have multiple departments one of which would be armed officers whose job would be to respond to and investigate major crimes and unsafe situations. Other departments would include a mentalhealthcrisis response a civilservice department cleanup homelessness issues taking police reports for petty crimes and a few others. Only the armed police would carry weapons and they would be reserved for situations both that required an armed response and that they were trained for. The idea didn t come out of whole cloth. I grew up in New Jersey and I was inspired by how Camden helped improve their public safety. By dissolving their police department and merging safety with the county they got more resources more police not fewer and they eliminated the excessive protections their local police union gave to misbehaving officers. Given where we lived I thought that this idea would be received very enthusiastically but as you can probably guess my organization declined to start pushing the proposals. It never got in front of our elected representatives. The city s leadership continued to argue about the issue along the margins. Very little had changed. The partisan story we often tell about policing and crime doesn t do us any service. Making things better will require a more holistic approach. Just as it is insufficient to be tough on crime it is also not a fix if we defund the police. We need better more proactive and more accountable policing. We need more resources in the areas where our communities have the greatest need. And to do this we will have to summon courage. A real fix will mean tough decisions money spent and constituencies angered. It s hard complicated and risky. But the problem won t go away if we ignore it. It s time for us to start doing the hard work to help repair the communities we hold so dear. As a returned citizen felon I have more than just some thoughts on crime and policing. I m also a straight cis white male. And the reason I state that is just to put it out there that yes 100 percent without question from what I ve seen and my experience with the justice system it is irrevocably broken unfair unjust and absolutely without a doubt systemically racist in its application and outcomes. Throughout my late teens and early 20s I developed quite an advanced addiction habit I m now seven years clean and grateful to talk about this stuff with a clear head. Without getting too detailed I ll just say it culminated in my arrest for multiple highclass felonies. If I d taken it to trial I would have been facing 28 years. Obviously that isn t what happened and I m thankful I was given an opportunity to prove I could function in society and thanks to voters in Florida now I can vote. But after educating myself while I was in I did two years reading learning more about government drug policy policing and the war on drugs I started to see wild ideas as not so wild anymore. My outcome was the result of absolute privilege and I am willing to acknowledge how unfair and unjust the system is to so many people. It s humbling to know that I could ve effectively ended my young adult life had it not been for the color of my skin the family and support system I have where I was born and how I look. It s flatout unfair it perpetuates the same system that we have and there s no end in sight. Crime is so high now because we didn t institute some of the lessons learned in the 1990s. Boston pioneered youthviolenceprevention initiatives that focused on teaching conflictresolution skills and minimizing social determinants of violence such as poverty child abuse unemployment and mentalhealth and substanceabuse issues. In the late 1990s what has been called the largest public health study you ve never heard of was published giving researchers publichealth officials and everyone interested in fixing social problems a huge windfall the Adverse Childhood Experiences study demonstrated that addiction mental illness poverty employment struggles suicide and other problems all were directly related to child abuse neglect and trauma. And researchers had known how to prevent much child abuse and trauma for 20 years. But we weren t prepared to drop our focus on crime being fixed by policing. Preventing social problems by protecting children didn t fit any partisan worldview so it was easily neglected. Now we have had another generation come of age without our society s investment in preventing adverse childhood experiences. And they re hurt and angry and had to live two years with the very few sources of stability and support in their lives interrupted by the pandemic. Now we even have clear proof that ACEs are directly tied to involvement in the criminaljustice system. And we re still not talking about prevention. We re not talking about preventing children from experiencing abuse neglect and trauma. We re limiting our options to discussions of Do we lock up the hurting? Or do we invest in expensive treatments to minimize the amount of damage they do to our society? But we re not talking about investing in prevention the only humane choice. And in doing so we re setting the stage to have this same conversation in 20 more years. For over 40 years I was a social worker who specialized in the assessment and treatment of child abuse. This required me to work closely with law enforcement throughout the intermountain states. In the past two decades I saw a change in the attitudes manners and personalities of officers not all of them but many. This played out with displays of machismo refusal to follow patient safety rules in the hospital and unreasonable demands of personnel. When thwarted they threatened. Some of the changes in attitude solidified after the Bush administration pushed military equipment to law enforcement essentially militarizing police officers. I also think that the freeforall gun ownership in this country has made it impossible for police officers to feel safe without militarygrade protection and weapons. We need more police officers but we need fewer of the macho type using the job to prove their manhood. They need training in psychology and human behavior. They need to know how and when to deescalate rather than exacerbate. And we need to get rid of all the guns out there that contribute daily to making all of us much less safe. As always thanks for all of your emails. I read each and every one. See you tomorrow.
https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/defund-the-police, By June the persistence and duration of the protests had produced historic changes in white people s perceptions. A national poll recorded an unprecedented shift in opinion seventyone per cent of whites said that they think racism and discrimination are a big problem in the United States and fiftyfive per cent said that the anger of the protests was fully justified. In a different poll sixty per cent expressed support for the Black Lives Matter movement. This sea change in opinion was mirrored by a wave of public gestures of racial reconciliation as a host of corporate executives acknowledged if not accepted genuine responsibility for their roles in sustaining regimes of racial inequality. Nascar renounced the flying of the Confederate flag at its events. Juneteenth long an informal day of celebrations among some AfricanAmericans was suddenly institutionalized as a paid holiday. Former President George W. Bush condemned systemic racism. At one level the rapid reflexive default to offering symbolic recognition of racism was quite typical. No other country engages in the cavernous nothingness of the fake apology as frequently as the United States. In the case of Black Americans it is most recognizable in the form of bigsounding civilrights legislation that is eventually as the historian Leon Litwack has written compromised deferred and undone.  It is clearly a craven gesture when multibilliondollar corporations claim that Black lives matter even as they refuse their Black workers hazard pay paid time off or a living wage. Nevertheless these lite searches for absolution from the sin of systemic racism have reaffirmed that racism is not only about burning crosses and the Nword it is also present in the housing market in institutions of higher education in the job market and most certainly in policing and the criminaljustice system. In this moment when both the coronavirus pandemic and the uprising are laying bare structural flaws in U.S. society there has been a renewed discussion of structural remedies. This is why defund the police a demand that only a marginal handful dared to put forward just months ago has become a central slogan of the re mergent B.L.M. movement. The echoes of the nineteensixties freedom struggles are easy to find. Then as now Black revolutionaries including Martin Luther King Jr. countered racist claims that poverty and social marginalization were the products of domestic dysfunction specific to Black families. In doing so they made room for a deeper interrogation of the Black condition in the United States. Then as now radicals stepped into that space and linked Black poverty to pervasive racial discrimination from public schools to employment opportunities to the availability of good housing. They also showed that there were financial interests that benefitted from maintaining Black inequality. Black radicals described the financial plight of ordinary Black people as evidence that their segregated communities were colonies within the U.S. Internal colonialism as some referred to the particular oppressive conditions faced by Black people could be found in white landlords charging exorbitant rents for ratinfested apartments and in renttoown stores demanding unconscionable interest rates all because AfricanAmericans were a captured market isolated by relentless residential segregation. The recognition of institutional racism as the controlling factor in Black inequality rather than some pernicious culture of poverty pointed to the need for institutional solutions. This was the backdrop to the Johnson Administration s vast expansion of the federal government. From 1963 through 1968 Congress at the President s urging passed nearly two hundred pieces of legislation as part of the War on Poverty and the Great Society. From the Department of Housing and Urban Development to Head Start to food stamps and Medicare these programs created a bottom through which average citizens could not fall. Spending on antipoverty programs grew by tens of billions of dollars during the nineteensixties producing dramatic declines in the number of people living in poverty across the country. By the early seventies the poverty rate had dropped to eleven per cent from a high of twentytwo per cent in 1959 when the federal government began keeping track. The big spending of the era was not limited to eradicating poverty. By the midsixties crime rates had begun to tick upward for a variety of reasons including how crime was counted and reported. Black uprisings against racism and police brutality contributed to the rising rates as did the continuing Black migration into cities that offered no meaningful employment opportunities. The rising rate of crime also meant a greater police presence creating a greater likelihood for police abuse and violence. By 1964 even as Democrats were celebrating the passage of the Civil Rights Act and the legal end to Jim Crow in the South frustrations in the epicenters of northern Black life began to boil over. That summer Harlem and Philadelphia exploded in revolt against unemployment lowpaying jobs poor housing and everpresent police brutality. There were hundreds of arrests and millions of dollars in property damage announcing a new stage in the movement for Black rights inside and outside of the South. As the rebellions against urban conditions accelerated President Johnson turned to law enforcement to regain control of imploding cities. More and better trained police both Democrats and Republicans believed was a solution. On March 8 1965 the day after the historic Bloody Sunday march on Selma Alabama led by the late John Lewis Johnson introduced new legislation that was aimed at using federal dollars to beef up law enforcement across the country. Despite the nationally televised brutal beating of civilrights activists by Alabama state troopers a day earlier on the Edmund Pettus Bridge Johnson focussed his comments on crime in cities. No right is more elemental to our society than the right to personal security and no right needs more urgent protection he said. Johnson s and then Nixon s descriptions of the Black insurgency as lawless disorder pivoted the national focus away from systemic racism and toward crime. As the political scientist Naomi Murakawa has pointed out the United States did not face a crime problem that was racialized it faced a race problem that was criminalized.  The turn to the politics of punishment was not a political gimmick that would change from one Administration to the next. It marked a transition in all of U.S. politics. This turn could be measured in the growing reluctance of Democrats to embrace social welfare and the root causes explanation for crime. It could also be gauged by changing spending patterns across the entire criminaljustice system. The Floyd uprisings have created new urgency in the struggle for genuine safety in workingclass Black communities highlighting the need for wellresourced public services good and plentiful jobs and secure and beautiful housing without the menacing presence of the police. But creating this other world is complicated by the reality of crime and violence in the existing one. As the uprising erupted so did a dramatic rise in gun violence in Black communities across the country. In Philadelphia shootings are up nearly thirty per cent from a year ago twentythree people were shot over the course of twentyfour hours during the Fourth of July weekend. In Atlanta that weekend thirtyone people were shot in eleven different incidents leaving five dead. In New York City there were sixtyfour shootings during the Independence Day holiday and ten deaths. In Chicago the shootings began almost simultaneously with the antibrutality rebellion in the streets. Six days after the murder of George Floyd on May 31st eighteen people were murdered in Chicago most of them Black. Never before in the sixty years during which such statistics have been kept had that number of people been killed by gun violence in a single twentyfourhour period. Black Chicagoans and AfricanAmericans elsewhere who suffer the brunt of gun violence have been marching organizing and speaking out against the crime that threatens to devour their neighborhoods. Their efforts are typically ignored because they don t fit with the conventional law and order wisdom. Instead Donald Trump and a host of rightwing bigots have twisted the scale of Black death in Chicago into a racial slur. For them the pain in Black communities from reckless gun violence is secondary if it registers at all. Trump and his Republican Party cohort don t actually care about the life and death of Black people in the United States that much has been obvious for many years. Trump once described Baltimore as a disgusting rat and rodentinfested mess where no human being would want to live. The tenor of that statement made clear that any city with a sizable Black population could be inserted for Baltimore. For more than fifty years Republicans have been the chief champions of policies that increased the tribulations that have become synonymous with Black life. But most AfricanAmericans know this which is why when the Republican Party lectures Black America with the stench of white supremacy on its breath its speech falls mostly on deaf ears. Beyond the exploitation of Black death for cheap political gain by the right the rhetoric of BlackonBlack crime muddies the important distinction between interpersonal violence and statesanctioned violence. To clarify this difference is not to minimize the deep despair and loss that accompany the senseless murders causing fear in the Black neighborhoods of Chicago and other cities. Instead calling attention to the police s presence and behavior in these communities underlines the violence and intimidation that pervade them in every respect. Police brutality has been the single most important political rallying cry across Black communities for decades because it is the most visceral evidence of the secondclass citizenship of poor and workingclass AfricanAmericans. When the police can stop and question you frisk and beat you potentially arrest and occasionally murder you then you are not an equal citizen. The consequences of Black encounters with the police and the broader criminaljustice system are lifealtering and often lifeshattering. Of course the loss of a loved one from gun violence is also catastrophic but it comes without one element that is specific to encounters with state violence the abrogation of fundamental human and social rights. exposed deep and longstanding fault lines between black and Latino communities on the one hand and the police on the other arising from police shootings to be sure but also about daily pervasive transgressions that prevent people of all ages races ethnicities and gender across Chicago from having basic freedom of movement in their own neighborhoods. Stopped without justification verbally and physically abused and in some instances arrested and then detained without counsel that is what we heard about over and over again. The investigators came to this stunning conclusion CPD s own data gives validity to the widely held belief the police have no regard for the sanctity of life when it comes to people of color.  When Representative Alexandria OcasioCortez recently suggested that a crime spurt in New York City might have to do with the financial strain of the pandemic she was greeted incredulously. She continued Maybe this has to do with the fact that people aren t paying their rent and are scared to pay their rent and so they go out and they need to feed their child and they don t have money so they re put in a position where they feel like they either need to shoplift some bread or go hungry that night. She went on to say that the idea that violent crime is somehow immune or totally separated from the economic situation that people are going through right now I think that s mistaken. She continued It s true the desperation even if we re not talking about petty theft there is a ladder that escalates into violent crime that is very much connected to the economic situation of a given community.  Naturally OcasioCortez s remarks caused a frenzy on the right. The White House took the opportunity to denounce the demand to defund the police while calling OcasioCortez preposterous. Representative Ted Yoho of Florida confronted OcasioCortez on the Capitol steps claiming that she was out of her freaking mind for linking poverty to crime. He called her a fucking bitch as he walked away from her channelling the misogyny that is typically tightly bound to the hatred of the poor. But it isn t just the right wing. The Democratic governor of New York Andrew Cuomo also chimed in saying that it was factually impossible to blame the crime wave in the city on fears of evictions. Cuomo seemed to think that because there is a moratorium on evictions in New York poor people no longer worry about how they will pay their rent. Making matters decidedly worse many consequences of poverty have been turned into crimes including sleeping in cars or public places panhandling for money or food public urination shoplifting and many other things that poor people do when they do not have the privacy and discretion of their own residence. The criminalization of poverty deepens its inescapability by putting the poor into direct contact with the police. He never got a legitimate job perhaps dissuaded by the experiences of the young men in the neighborhood most of whom worked until they were fired or they quit because minimum wage came too slowly and disappeared too quickly. They sold dope between jobs until they could find more work as a convenience store clerk or a janitor or a landscaper. Her brother was killed by a drunk driver at nineteen. Ward concludes He saw no American dream no fairy tale ending no hope.  Ward s memoir follows the life and death of her brother and four other young Black men all trapped in similar cycles of futility that ultimately lead to their untimely deaths. When this elemental hopelessness contributes to premature deaths among white people it is universally viewed more empathically. When trying to understand the phenomena leading to the recent decline of life expectancy among ordinary white men and women social scientists coined the term deaths of despair. These deaths most immediately caused by opioid addiction alcoholism and suicide have come to be understood as related to deepening personal instability and insecurity amid a social crisis. Compared to an earlier era of cocaine use and addiction opioid addiction today is more likely to be regarded as a publichealth problem and the public discussion surrounding the addiction often emphasizes treatment over imprisonment. Some elected officials mischaracterize the need to shift funds away from the police saying that resources must be redirected to social services because police are being asked to respond to crimes stemming from drug abuse homelessness and mental illness. Representative Karen Bass a Democrat from Los Angeles and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus who described defund the police as probably one of the worst slogans ever recently asked rhetorically why police officers have to clean up society s problems. She continued Why doesn t a city deal with its social problems so not so much money would have to go to law enforcement? But it is simply not true that police have become caretakers mentalhealth professionals and social workers. To make such a claim degrades these professions which require years of studying and training for the purpose of improving people s lives. Bass s mischaracterization also sows confusion about what the police are generally doing in such cases which is arresting people who are in crisis or just poor. They are not intervening for the sake of reducing harm. The political fusion of race and crime plays a critical role in manufacturing racist ideology here and abroad. The overwhelming presence of police in presumed Black spaces from typical police patrols in neighborhoods to officers menacing and intimidating role in public schools to their offices in public housing mark these places as sites of disorder and therefore in need of the hard hand of the law. This hypersurveillance of Black communities then produces a disproportionate number of arrests which legitimize calls for even more aggressive policing and more punishment. These are the daily policing practices that conflate race and crime thereby criminalizing AfricanAmericans. This is what makes policing institutionally racist in the United States. In 1960 James Baldwin wrote that the only way to police a ghetto is to be oppressive. He went on to write of policemen Their very presence is an insult and it would be even if they spent their entire day feeding gumdrops to children. They represent the force of the white world and that world s real intentions are simply for that world s criminal profit and ease to keep the black man corralled up here in his place. The badge the gun in the holster and the swinging club make vivid what will happen should his rebellion become overt. The practice of intimidation is so deep in the marrow of American policing that it exists whether the administrator or officer is Black or white. Perhaps the most significant change in U.S. policing since the nineteensixties era of reform has been the recruitment and training of thousands of Black officers across the country. But the multiracial character of postcivilrights policing has not meant less racism brutality or arrest. Instead it has coincided with the rise of mass incarceration and the explosion of Black Lives Matter. This reflects the contradictory views of AfricanAmericans in particular as well as the newness of this iteration of the B.L.M. movement. The political leaders of our country have spent the better part of fifty years trying to convince the public that the biggest threat to their lives is the possibility that they might become the victim of a violent crime. Those ideas will not just melt away in a matter of weeks. The importance of social movements is that they force people to more deeply engage with an issue than they otherwise would. In the case of police brutality the ubiquity and the duration of the recent protests have forced a much broader layer of society to grapple with the issues that Black people have been mobilizing around for more than a hundred years. Consider the transformation of opinion concerning the B.L.M. movement more generally. Today several years after its formation it is finally experiencing wide public support. Now that millions of white people understand the severity of police brutality against Black people the possibility that they ultimately see the end of policing as a solution is hardly utopian especially as each passing day seems to bring more visual evidence of the racism and brutality of police across the U.S. We need to start over. No one should expect that to be a popular conclusion overnight. But neither should anyone conclude that it is unrealistic to defund and eventually abandon an armed layer of agents intent on maintaining a social order that is deeply racist unequal and violently deprives ordinary people especially Black people of the basic necessities of life. Defunding the police is the first step in a longer process that may culminate in the end of policing in the United States. The repeated failures of substantive and meaningful reform have brought us to the point where concepts like defunding and abolition have penetrated mainstream conversations. Their suggestion does not mean that activists are impervious to the violence and crime that exist in workingclass communities. Instead the argument to defund the police begins with the recognition of the relationship between robust funding for police and the consistent lack of adequate funding for the programs and institutions that may have the most impact on improving the quality of life for poor and workingclass Black people. In this case robbing Peter to pay Paul can reduce crime reduce violence and reduce the harm that ensues. Bottoming out police budgets will not on its own create the resources necessary to build communities anew. But it would shift the balance away from the decadeslong orientation on law and order toward treatment and care. The abolition of policing may seem farfetched to some but in effect the racist batter of the police has already been baked. We cannot go back now and decide to take out this or that thing. The whole cake has to be discarded starting with its most vile ingredient the presumption of Black criminality and guilt. The reimagining of a just society has inevitably come into conflict with the racist barbarism of American police. We must begin again.

Sections Sections Share Share Search Sections Sections Share Share Subscribe to How We RiseSign Up Commentary  SociologistRay June 19 2020 Center for Effective Public Management Race Prosperity and Inclusion Initiative George Floyd s death has galvanized much of America to move the needle toward police reform ideas such as defunding police that were previously viewed as radical.  Defund the police means reallocating or redirecting funding away from the police department to other government agencies funded by the local municipality. That s it. It s that simple. Defund does not mean abolish policing. And even some who say abolish do not necessarily mean to do away with law enforcement altogether. Rather they want to see the rotten trees of policing chopped down and fresh roots replanted anew. Camden New Jersey is a good example. Nearly a decade ago Camden disbanded abolished its police force and dissolved the local police union. This approach seems to be what Minneapolis will do in some form though the nuances are important. Different from abolishing and starting anew defunding police highlights fiscal responsibility advocates for a marketdriven approach to taxpayer money and has some potential benefits that will reduce police violence and crime. Below I outline some of the main arguments for defunding the police. Data show that 9 out of 10 calls for service are for nonviolent encounters. Now this does not mean that an incident will not turn violent but police at times contribute to the escalation of violent force. Police officers skillset and training are often out of sync with the social interactions that they have. Police officers are mostly trained in useofforce tactics and worstcase scenarios to reduce potential threats. However most of their interactions with civilians start with a conversation. Advocates for the defund movement like Phillip McHarris and Thenjiwe McHarris argue that shifting funding to social services that can improve things such as mental health addiction and homelessness is a better use of taxpayer money. This approach further enhances the push to decriminalize and destigmatize people with mental health conditions and addiction problems. Ever since the overcriminalization of people addicted to crack cocaine in the 1990s some scholars practitioners and policymakers have said that this shift is long overdue. Additionally the research I have conducted with hundreds of police officers show that they respond to everything from potholes in the street to cats stuck up a tree. Police officers are also increasingly asked to complete paperwork and online forms. Obviously documentation is important and desperately needed. The overwhelmingly blank report in the killing of Breonna Taylor in Louisville that listed her injuries as none highlights the importance of documentation. It could be argued however that reducing officer workload would increase the likelihood of solving violent crimes. Police officers are overworked and overstressed. Focusing on menial tasks throughout the day is inefficient and a waste of taxpayer money. Other government actors should be responsible for these and receive adequate funding for doing them. Police officers are not as successful as people think at solving violent crime. My Brookings colleagues Andre Perry David Harshbarger Carl Romer and Kristian Thymianos argue that the failure to prosecute murderous police typifies a bad overall track record with solving violent crimes Approximately 38 of murders 66 of rapes 70 of robberies and 47 of aggravated assaults go uncleared every year. Maybe in baseball or basketball these rates make a player an allstar but the public expects police officers to be more successful at solving violent crime. More importantly police stops relative to charges and convictions are relatively low. To show how egregious this is a study of the NYPD stopandfrisk program found that well over 90 of people stopped by the police were not committing any crime and did not have any contraband or weapons on them. Overwhelmingly the people stopped were Black and Latino and physical force was used half the time. Interestingly police were more successful at identifying criminality for whites versus Blacks. This is because officers use suspicious behavior when interacting with whites and use skin tone as the metric of suspicion when interacting with Black people. More police on the streets may be used to control the movement of Black bodies rather than solving crime. This is why the New York State Supreme Court ruled stopandfrisk as unconstitutional. Noknock warrants and chokeholds should follow this pattern. One consistent finding in the social science literature is that if we really want to reduce crime education equity and the establishment of a work infrastructure is the best approach. A study using 60 years of data found that an increase in funding for police did not significantly relate to a decrease in crime. Throwing more police on the street to solve a structural problem is one of the reasons why people are protesting in the streets. Defunding police reallocating funding away from police departments to other sectors of government may be more beneficial for reducing crime and police violence. In recent weeks some large municipalities with a history of police brutality have reallocated funds in line with the defund police movement. Los Angeles will have at least 100 million reallocated away from LAPD to programs for minority communities. San Francisco Mayor London Breed said that she will work with community groups to reprioritize funding. Baltimore City Council voted to reallocate 22 million away from the police department s fiscal budget for 2021 which is typically over 500 million. The city council plans to redirect the funding to recreational centers trauma centers and forgivable loans for Blackowned businesses. Prince George s County Maryland aims to reallocate 20 million away from a new training facility for its police department though the money will not come out of the police department s budget and to remove student resource officers from schools. Other areas such as Minneapolis have advocated for removing police officers from schools as well. Altogether it is clear that municipalities across the U.S. are making changes in line with the defund police movement. So while the word reallocate may be a more palatable digestible word on the House floor or at a city council meeting defund surely gets more attention on a protest sign. And more importantly it seems to be having an impact.

https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/defunding-the-police-will-actually-make-us-safer, This OpEd first appeared on Cosmopolitan. Almost exactly six years after NYPD officers murdered Eric Garner in New York City Minneapolis police officers murdered George Floyd. Activists advocates and protestors are still screaming I can t breathe and begging government officials for police reform that will end police violence in Black communities. But today s demands are bigger and bolder Now protesters are advocating for systemic changes that require a complete reimagining of law enforcement in the United States. American policing has never been a neutral institution. The first U.S. city police department was a slave patrol and modern police forces have directed oppression and violence at Black people to enforce Jim Crow wage the War on Drugs and crack down on protests. When people ask for police reform many are actually asking for this oppressive system to be dismantled and to invest in institutions resources and services that help communities grow and thrive. That s why many protestors and activists following in the footsteps of Blackled grassroots groups are demanding immediate defunding of police departments. The idea of defunding or divestment is new to some folks but the basic premise is simple We must cut the astronomical amount of money that our governments spend on law enforcement and give that money to more helpful services like job training counseling and violenceprevention programs. Each year state and local governments spend upward of 100 billion dollars on law enforcement and that s excluding billions more in federal grants and resources. Budgets are not created in a vacuum. They can be changed through targeted advocacy and organizing. We can demand that our local officials including city council members and mayors stop allocating funds for the police to acquire more militarized equipment and instead ask for that money to go toward communityrun violenceprevention programs. We can demand that our federal government redirect the money that funds police presence in schools to putting counselors in schools instead. Funneling so many resources into law enforcement instead of education affordable housing and accessible health care has caused significant harm to communities. Police violence is actually a leading cause of death for Black men A recent study found that 1 in 1000 Black men can expect to be killed by police and public health experts have described police violence as a serious public health issue. For a country like ours which considers itself a modern democracy that pushes ideals of freedom and justice for all that number should be truly shocking. Much of the work police do is merely engage in the daily harassment of Black communities for minor crimes or crimes of poverty that shouldn t be criminalized in the first place. Consider this Out of the 10.3 million arrests made per year only 5 percent are for the most serious offenses including murder rape and aggravated assault. These are the ones that truly threaten public safety. The other 95 percent of arrests are for things like traffic violations marijuana possession unlawful assembly and even removing a shopping cart from store premises. That means that police spend the most resources going after minor incidents that actually don t threaten everyday life but do lead to mass criminalization and incarceration. And as you know some arrests are made for doing nothing at all beyond being Black. We have little evidence if any to show that more police surveillance results in fewer crimes and greater public safety. Indeed funneling police into communities of color and pushing officers to make arrests just perpetuates harm and trauma. Yet since the 1980s spending on law enforcement and our criminal legal system has dramatically outpaced that in community services such as housing education and violence prevention programs. Those are the institutions that help build stable safe and healthy communities. For example Los Angeles s budget gives police 3.14 billion out of the city s 10.5 billion. Spending on community services such as economic development 30 million and housing 81 million pale in comparison to the massive LAPD budget. On Wednesday night after years of Black Lives Matter grassroots activists demanding a cut in LAPD s budget Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced he would cut 100 million to 150 million from the LAPD budget and reinvest those funds in communities of color. Similarly in New York City the government spends almost 6 billion on policing which is more than it does on the Department of Health Homeless Services Housing Preservation and Development and Youth and Community development combined. By shrinking their massive budgets we can help end decades of racially driven social control and oppression as well as address social problems at their root instead of investing in an institution that further oppresses and terrorizes communities. In addition to divesting from police and reinvesting the savings in nonpunitive programs that benefit public safety and health there are other critical steps we need to take to foster the systemic change people across the country are calling for For too long the focus on police reform has been dominated by reforms that try to reduce the harms of policing rather than rethink the overall role of police in society. But six years after the Black Lives Matter movement rose to national attention activists across the country are coming together to demand what many have known has been the solution all along defund the police.
https://www.procon.org/headlines/defund-the-police-top-3-pros-and-cons/, While there are multiple interpretations of defund the police the basic definition is to move funding away from police departments and into community resources such as mental health experts housing and social workers. In the larger scope of the civil rights movement some advocates would reallocate some police funding while keeping police departments others would combine defunding with other police reforms such as body cameras and bias training and others see defunding as a small step toward ultimately abolishing police departments and the prison system entirely. 1 2 3 4 5 6  According to the most recent data available departments received about 129 billion nationwide in 2020 from state and local governments up from 42.3 billion in 1977. Police budgets have made up around 4 of total state and local budgets since 1977. According to the Urban Institute from 1977 to 2020 in 2020 inflationadjusted dollars state and local government spending on police increased from 45 billion to 129 billion an increase of 189 percent. Individual cities or counties may allocate more or fewer funds to police departments. The 2017 Los Angeles city budget for example provided 23 of the budget to police while 9 of Los Angeles county s budget went to policing. About 97 of police budgets go toward operational costs such as salaries and benefits. 7 8 9 61 In June 2020 64 of Americans opposed the abstract idea of defunding the police while 34 supported the movement. 60 were against reallocating police budget funds to other public health and social programs while 39 were in favor. 10 In Oct. 2021 21 of American adults wanted police budgets increased a lot and 26 wanted budgets increased a little while 9 wanted police budgets decreased a little and 6 decreased a lot. 37 said budgets should stay about the same. 58 In his Mar. 1 2022 State of the Union address President Joe Biden declared We should all agree The answer is not to defund the police. It s to fund the police. Fund them. Fund them. Fund them with resources and training. By Aug. 31 2022 the movement was largely quiet with opinion articles declaring Defund the Police Is Dead. 65 62 A Mar. 2023 criminology study found that while police departments have not been widely defunded the departments are experiencing between a 2.2 and 16 loss of fulltime police officers. The loss has prompted some departments including the New Orleans Police Department to use third party organizations to respond to some 911 calls including minor traffic accidents. Ethan Cheramie founder of On Scene Services OSS that hires former police officers as unarmed responders states Citizens still call 911 their call is still dispatched. However it is dispatched to our agents . You re going to continue to see alternative police response be divested from guys with guns over to civilians to respond to these nonviolent calls for service. 59 60 Paige Fernandez MPP Policing Policy Advisor for the ACLU noted American policing has never been a neutral institution. The first U.S. city police department was a slave patrol and modern police forces have directed oppression and violence at Black people to enforce Jim Crow wage the War on Drugs and crack down on protests. Police departments are also often outfitted with surplus military equipment increasing police firepower and the attitude that police are at war with communities which can escalate situations to violence. 11 12 Organizations such as mpd150 which surveyed the Minneapolis Police Department s conduct since its inception in 1867 argue that the police system is actually not broken it s working as it always has because the police were established to protect the interests of the wealthy and racialized violence has always been part of the mission. mpd150 states that the police system puts millions of people of color in prison which limits or deprives them of voting rights employment education and access to housing among other privileges given automatically to white people. 13 According to an Aug. 20 2019 study Black American men are 2.5 times more likely to be killed by police than white men Black women 1.4 times more likely than white women. A 2018 Bureau of Justice Statistics report shows police officers were twice as likely to use force against people of color than against white people. In 2019 US police officers killed 1098 people 24 of whom were Black despite African Americans representing only 13 of the US population. 14 15 16 17 The American Public Health Association declared police violence a public health issue in 2018 stating almost 10 percent of all homicides in the US are committed by police. Even if some may be lawful it s not ok that we kill 10001200 people a year by police. 18 Defunding the police could result in fewer crimes and less violence from police. During several weeks in 2014 and 2015 when New York City police pulled back on broken windows policing that focused on actively patrolling for lowlevel crimes about 2100 fewer major crimes were reported which represents a 36 drop in a matter of weeks. If police are not actively patrolling for minor crimes and are responding to fewer major crimes there are fewer opportunities for violence. 19 Mariame Kaba a prison industrial complex abolitionist states Enough. We can t reform the police. The only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police. There is not a single era in United States history in which the police were not a force of violence against black people. 20 Kaba notes the first major police misconduct investigation was in 1894 in New York City the Lexow Committee in which over 100 officers were collectively convicted of 56 charges of thirddegree assault 45 charges of seconddegree assault as well as multiple charges of criminal neglect oppression and attempted rape. Only four officers were dismissed as a result three because they d assaulted other officers. 20 21 Philip V. McHarris PhD candidate at Yale University and Thenjiwe McHarris from Movement for Black Lives argue Look at the Minneapolis Police Department which is held up as a model of progressive police reform. The department offers procedural justice as well as trainings for implicit bias mindfulness and deescalation. It embraces community policing and officer diversity bans warrior style policing uses body cameras implemented an early intervention system to identify problematic officers receives training around mental health crisis intervention and practices reconciliation efforts in communities of color. 22 And still George Floyd and 51 other Black men along with 15 American Indian men and 9 Hispanic men were killed by Minneapolis Police Department officers between Jan. 2000 and May 31 2020. Further reforms have been recommended to the Minneapolis Police Department repeatedly to lower useofforce violations but none were implemented. 23 24 In July 2014 Eric Garner died from a chokehold performed by a police officer after New York banned the hold in 1993. Austin and Los Angeles police were shown firing projectiles at people s heads which is prohibited in both jurisdictions. Increased diversity on police forces did little to curb unnecessary police stops of people of color in Ferguson or Baltimore. 25 Two 2016 Harvard University studies found that antibias techniques meant to fight stereotypes reduced implicit bias for a few hours to a few days but not longer. Such training has little to no effect on racial bias in traffic stops or marijuana arrests. 26 27 Some including Stuart Schrader Associate Director of the Program in Racism Immigration and Citizenship at Johns Hopkins University argue that reforms are not wholly intended to change the departments for the better but are an excuse for the departments to maintain power and acquire a bigger budget. Reform programs come with more money and little accountability for police departments continuing the historical cycle of oppression. 28 Police currently deal with calls about mental illness homelessness domestic disputes barking dogs neighbors playing loud music and various noncriminal activities on top of actual violations of the law ranging from minor shoplifting by kids to speeding to murder. In a 2016 interview former Dallas Police Chief David Brown stated We re just asking us to do too much. Every societal failure we put it off for the cops to solve. That s too much to ask. Policing was never meant to solve all those problems. 2 Alicia Garza CoFounder of Black Lives Matter stated So much of policing right now is generated and directed towards qualityoflife issues homelessness drug addiction domestic violence. What we do need is increased funding for housing we need increased funding for education we need increased funding for quality of life of communities who are overpoliced and oversurveilled. 29 The people who respond to community issues should be those best equipped to deal with the concern whether that is a social worker attending a mental health crisis an EMT arriving at a domestic dispute or a housing facilitator helping an unhoused person. Colin Kaepernick explains by abolishing policing and prisons not only can we eliminate white supremacist establishments but we can create space for budgets to be reinvested directly into communities to address mental health needs homelessness and houselessness access to education and job creation as well as communitybased methods of accountability. 5 63 Greg Casar Austin Texas City Council Member stated We should be treating homelessness not with policing but with housing. We should be treating addiction not with policing but with treatment. We have dedicated so many of our public dollars simply to policing and that hasn t made us actually more safe. 1 Further defunding the police allows more money to go to community programs that prevent the need for police. Patrick Sharkey Professor at Princeton University notes When neighborhood organizations engage young people with wellrun afterschool activities and summer jobs programs those young people are dramatically less likely to become involved in violent activities. When street outreach workers intervene they can be extremely effective in interrupting conflicts before they escalate. When local organizations reclaim abandoned lots and turn them into green spaces violence falls. When community nonprofits proliferate across a city that city becomes safer. 30 He adds If we ask community organizations and leaders to take over primary responsibility for creating a safe community they should be given equivalent resources. Defunding the police would free up budget funds to appropriately pay community organizations. 30 Annie Lowrey staff writer for The Atlantic explains A more radical option would mean ending mass incarceration cash bail finesandfees policing the war on drugs and police militarization as well as getting cops out of schools. It would also mean funding housingfirst programs creating subsidized jobs for the formerly incarcerated and expanding initiatives to have mentalhealth professionals and social workers respond to emergency calls. 3 For a World without Police an abolitionist group states Police violence stems not just from bad apples or bad attitudes but from what police must be and do in America. The only way to stop the violence is to abolish the police and transform the conditions that gave rise to them. 57 Police officers in smaller jurisdictions or those primarily populated by people of color are frequently paid less. In Hillsdale a suburb of St. Louis Missouri new officers earn 13.50 an hour after a probationary period less than hourly workers at Target. Low wages force many officers to take extra jobs leaving them tired and unprepared to deal with a highstress police situation. David Harris University of Pittsburgh Law Professor stated We should not assume that the most poorlypaid cops are the worst cops. But the chances increase that you don t attract the best officers. 31 32 33 During the 2008 recession many police departments were forced to cut officers as federal funding decreased. In Memphis useofforce complaints almost doubled as officers in an understaffed department were required to work overtime. 34 In England and Wales 2010 police budgets were cut resulting in 20592 14 fewer officers in 2017 and 20 more gun knife and serious violent crimes. The homicide rate also rose 39 from Mar. 2015 and 2019. In Mar. 2020 the Home Office acknowledged a correlation and committed to hiring 20000 officers. 35 36 Illinois State Police Director Jonathon Monken reported an increase in fatal car accidents due to a decrease in motorcycle traffic officers after 2010 budget cuts. In order to raise funds for the department Monken implemented a policy wherein 15 for each citation such as a speeding ticket written goes to the state police. 37 Called citation taxation departments taking a cut of each citation written is a common fundraising strategy. Such tickets often cost residents more than expected a 100 traffic ticket cost a California resident 100 in state assessment fees 70 in county assessment fees 50 in court construction fees 20 for emergency medical fees among other fees resulting in an almost 500 ticket for rolling through a red light. While no one wants to pay a 500 traffic violation ticket communities of color are especially hard hit and illequipped to pay such tickets. 38  Officers also write more tickets when department revenue is at stake. In St. Ann a St. Louis suburb speeding tickets almost tripled while the suburb s population decreased. In New Miami Village Ohio 45000 tickets were issued in 15 months to a population of about 2000 people. If appropriately funded police could focus on crime rather than fundraising. 38  In Camden New Jersey the local police department was disbanded due to police corruption and rising crime rates. The county now runs the department and implemented deescalation training defined chokeholds as deadly force and required that officers step in if a colleague is using excessive force. Officers were tasked with patrolling on foot introducing themselves to residents and hosting community barbecues. Violent crime dropped 42 between 2012 and 2019. In comparison the FBI estimates nationwide violent crime fell 9 from 2009 to 2018. 39 40 Sam Sinyangwe cofounder of We the Protestors explained if you look at the 30 largest cities police shootings have dropped about 30 percent and some cities have seen larger drops. In some of these cities like Chicago and Los Angeles activists with Black Lives Matter and other groups have done a lot of work to push for deescalation stricter useofforce policies and greater accountability. 41 Contrary to the publicly asserted war on Black people by white police officers few are actually murdered by white officers each year. An analysis of the Philadelphia Pennsylvania police department found white officers were least likely to shoot an unarmed Black person with a threat perception failure TPF rate of 5.2 with black suspects. Black officers had an 11.4 rate and Hispanic officers a 16.7 rate. 42 According to a June 2020 poll 82 of Americans agree that police use of chokeholds should be banned. 83 support racial profiling bans. 92 agree that police should wear body cameras. 89 agree on requiring officers to give their name badge number and a reason for the stop during police stops. 91 support independent investigations of misconduct in departments. And 75 support allowing police misconduct victims to sue departments for damages. 43 If police departments were reformed to focus on policing BLack neighborhoods the same way they police wealthy white neighborhoods police violence would decrease. Black neighborhoods suffer from underpolicing as police officers focus on traffic and drug stops. 44 Jill Leovy author of Ghettoside A True Story of Murder in America explains that police focus on nuisance and vice the cheap and easy lowhanging fruit of the trade while murders in predominantly Black neighborhoods go unsolved From 1988 to 2002 the number of unsolved homicides in the L.A. Police Department s South Bureau was 41 per square mile. Even as many white neighborhoods remained untouched by killings during this period some predominately black ones had three unsolved cases per block seven at the especially violent intersection of South San Pedro and East 84th streets. 44 Amid the George Floyd protests in May 2020 Chicago registered the city s most deadly weekend in six decades 110 shootings 85 wounded 25 killed. Nearly all of the victims and shooters were Black. Michael Pfleger a Roman Catholic priest and social activist in the South Side of Chicago stated On Saturday and particularly Sunday I heard people saying all over Hey there s no police anywhere police ain t doing nothing. 45 President Obama formed the President s Task Force on 21st Century Policing after the Aug. 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson Missouri. The May 2015 final report suggested that the Department of Justice should establish national benchmarks and best practices for federal state local and tribal police departments among 58 other nationally standardized requirements. 46 47 The Equal Justice Initiative EJI suggests many federal reforms including ending the transfer of military equipment to police departments a national comprehensive policy on useofforce a law banning lethal force a requirement that police departments acknowledge their racial inequalities and injustices mandatory racial biases training and eliminating qualified immunity which protects officers from being sued for wrongful death. EJI states these reforms can help to change the culture of policing to build trust legitimacy and accountability. 48 Ed Pilkington Chief Reporter for The Guardian US stated The need for restrictions on police power has been recognized in international law for 40 years. Two basic human rights are involved the right to life and personal security and the right of freedom from discrimination. Those rights have also been enshrined in core United Nations standards. All 193 member nations of the UN including the US have signed up to a code of conduct for law enforcement officials adopted in 1979. 49 A review of police departments in 20 of the largest American cities in 2017 and 2018 found that not one met the minimum standards established by human rights law. No state had a human rights compliant useofforce law only 12 cities had policies restricting useofforce to an immediate threat and only two cities Los Angeles and Chicago had the necessary external reporting requirements to meet international human rights standards. 50 Data compiled by The Guardian found that 59 people in the US were shot and killed by police in the first 24 days of 2015 compared to 55 people fatally shot by police in England and Wales in the past 24 years. 97 people in the US were fatally shot by police in Mar. 2015 compared to 94 in Australia between 1992 and 2011. 51  Across the political spectrum there s a consensus for requiring officers to wear body cameras mandating independent investigations of officerinvolved shootings and creating a national registry of police misconduct records. By 2 to 1 the public supports banning chokeholds and noknock search warrants. In a survey of more than 1800 Americans conducted in April and May by the Associated Press NORC Center for Public Affairs Research 60 percent of respondents said police supervisors should be penalized for racially biased conduct by their officers only 15 percent disagreed author Will Saletan summarizes. Police in other countries do not routinely carry guns chokeholds are banned and useofforce policies are stricter than in the United States. In Finland an officer must get supervisor approval before using deadly force and in Spain officers must fire a warning shot or shoot a nonvital body part before using lethal force. Officers in Europe train for an average of three years compared to about 19 months for Americans. These policies result in fewer citizen deaths in those countries. 52  Discussion Questions 2.
