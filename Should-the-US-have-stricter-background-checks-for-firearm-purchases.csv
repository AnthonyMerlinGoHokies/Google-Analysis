https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/background-checks-nics/, Federal law requires all firearm dealers to be licensed1 and to initiate a background check before transferring a firearm to a nondealer2regardless of where the transfer takes place.3 Background checks for firearms have been conducted through the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS since November 1998.4 However background checks don t stop criminals from stealing firearms getting them on the black market or getting them from straw purchasers. According to the Department of Justice DOJ 77 percent of criminals in state prison for firearm crimes get firearms through theft on the black market from a drug dealer or on the street or from family members and friends while less than one percent get firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun shows.5 A study by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives ATF of federal armed career criminals showed that while 79 percent had acquired their firearms from off the street sales criminal acts and relatives only six percent had acquired firearms from dealers or nondealers at gun shows and flea markets.6 According to the DOJ about 1.4 million guns or an annual average of 232400 were stolen during burglaries and other property crimes in the sixyear period from 2005 through 2010. 7The FBI s stolen firearm file contained over two million reports as of March 1995.8 ATF has said Those that steal firearms commit violent crimes with stolen guns transfer stolen firearms to others who commit crimes and create an unregulated secondary market for firearms including a market for those who are prohibited by law from possessing a gun. 9 ATF has reported the most frequent type of trafficking channel identified in ATF investigations is straw purchasing from federally licensed firearms dealers. Nearly 50 percent . . . . 10 Criminals defeat the background check system by getting guns through straw purchasers.11The terrorists who attacked in San Bernardino California in December 2015 used firearms they acquired through a straw purchaser.12 According to the nation s leading criminologist specializing in the study of murder Most mass murderers do not have criminal records or a history of psychiatric hospitalization. They would not be disqualified from purchasing their weapons legally. Certainly people cannot be denied their Second Amendment rights just because they look strange or act in an odd manner. Besides mass killers could always find an alternative way of securing the needed weaponry even if they had to steal from family members or friends.13 None of the mass shootings that former President Barack Obama named in a White House speech on gun control in January 2016 would have been prevented by requiring background checks on private sales of firearms.14 Further background checks would not have prevented any of the highprofile shootings with 10 or more fatalities that have occurred since Obamas speech.15 Gun control supporters are not being honest Background checks are not the most important thing we can do. Michael Bloomberg s gun control group says The single most important thing we can do to reduce gun violence is to require a criminal background check for every gun sale. 16The statement is preposterous. Since 1991 when the nation s violent crime rate hit an alltime high violent crime has been cut by half as gun control has been eliminated or ameliorated at the federal state and local levels.17 Most experts attribute the decrease in crime to economic factors improved policing programs the reduction in the crack cocaine trade increased incarceration rates and other factors unrelated to gun control.18 The FBI doesn t include gun ownership or gun control in its list of crime factors.19 There is no gun show loophole. 20Since 1994 federal law has required dealers to initiate a background check before selling or otherwise transferring a firearm whether at a gun show or anywhere else.21  Loophole is a phony term.The Gun Control Act 1968 and the Brady Act 1993 written and voted for by gun control supporters expressly impose recordkeeping and background check requirements on firearm dealers manufacturers and importers alone. The Gun Control Act s preamble states it is not the purpose of this title to place any undue or unnecessary federal restrictions or burdens on lawabiding citizens. 22 It s not 40 percent. In January 2013 the Washington Post gave President Obama Three Pinocchios for claiming that 40 percent of firearms are sold without a background check and noted that the authors of the study upon which the claim is based say we don t know the current percentage nor does anyone else. 23Nevertheless gun control supporters still repeat the 40 percent claim in their propaganda materials.24Whatever the percentage the fact remains that the nation s murder rate is at an alltime low.25 It s not 92 percent either. Gun control supporters claim that 92 percent of Americans support background checks on all firearm transfers.26 However in November 2014 despite gun control supporters spending millions of dollars promoting a private sales background check ballot initiative in Washington a state more receptive to gun control than most the initiative was approved by 59 percent of voters.27 Facing the same moneyed interests in November 2016 Maine voters rejected a background check referendum by a margin of 52 to 48 percent.28 That same year Nevada voters adopted an unenforceable background check measure 50.45 to 49.55 percent.29 Federal gun control laws are already strong enough In addition to requiring firearm dealers manufacturers and importers to initiate a background check on any nonlicensee to whom they intend to transfer a firearm and prohibiting the possession of firearms by nine categories of prohibited persons30 federal law already prohibits things associated with what gun control supporters call online or internet firearm sales. While a person may advertise a firearm on the internet  History of Background Checks Until 1988 when gun control supporters started calling for a ban on assault weapons they had tried to get a ban on handguns.31In 1976 the antigun group now known as the Brady Campaign described handgun registration as the second step in a threestep plan to prohibit the private possession of handguns.32 The first part of its plan was to slow down handgun sales and for many years it hoped to do so by having handgun purchases subjected to a waiting period and other restrictions. For example legislation introduced in Congress by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy DMass. and the late Rep. Peter Rodino DN.J. proposed a 21day waiting period on purchases of handguns from dealers limiting handgun purchases to two per year requiring a permit to acquire a handgun from a dealer prohibiting the manufacture and sale of handguns not deemed suitable for or readily adaptable to sporting purposes and imposing a 500 annual licensing fee on dealers who sold handguns.33 In the 1980s when the Brady Campaign was known as Handgun Control Inc. it continued to support waiting period legislation to slow down handgun sales and opposed the establishment of NICS.34 In 1993 Congress approved the Brady Act which imposed a waiting period of up to five days on handgun purchases from dealers until November 30 1998 at which time it required NICS checks for all firearms sold by dealers. Gun control supporters opposed the NICS provision. Once NICS was inevitable gun control supporters began advocating steps aimed at incrementally transforming it into a national registry of guns something they ve wanted for more than a century.35 At first they wanted background checks on all private i.e. nonlicensee sales trades and gifts of handguns.36 Then they wanted background checks on private transfers of all guns at gun shows.37 In 1996 a tiny group that still advocates banning handguns and other categories of firearms claimed that gun shows were a favored venue for criminals seeking to acquire guns.38 To drive gun shows out of business the group proposed that sales of handguns and assault weapons which together account for the majority of guns sold at shows and elsewhere and firearms regulated under the National Firearms Act be prohibited at shows.39 By the time that NICS became operational in November 1998 gun control supporters had realized that through a series of steps they might be able to use the system to achieve gun registration. In 1999 the lateSen. Frank Lautenberg DN.J. a longtime gun control supporter introduced legislation to require a NICS check on anyone who bought a gun at a gun show.40 In 2009 Lautenberg proposed that the FBI retain indefinitely records of people who pass NICS checks to acquire guns.41 Since December 2012 gun control supporters have demanded 42 background checks on all private transfers of all firearms regardless of location. And in 2013 Rep. Barbara Lee DCalif. introduced legislation to eliminate the requirement that the FBI destroy the records of approved NICS checks within 24 hours.43Also in 2013 the Department of Justice said that background checks on all firearm transfers depends on . . . requiring gun registration. 44NICS would become a registry of firearm transfers if all firearms transfers were subject to NICS checks and the FBI retained records of approved checks indefinitely both of which gun control supporters have proposed and such records included information currently maintained on federal Form 4473 documenting the identity of the firearm purchaser and the make model and serial number of the firearm transferred. Over time as people sell or bequeath their firearms a registry of firearm transfers would become a registry of firearms possessed.  1 The Gun Control Act 1968 18 USC 923a requires anyone engaged in the business of manufacturing importing or dealing in firearms to be licensed. The Firearms Owners Protection Act 1986 18 USC 921a21C stipulates that engaged in the business as applied to a dealer in firearms refers to . . . a person who devotes time attention and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms but such term shall not include a person who makes occasional sales exchanges or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. 2 The background check requirement is established by 18 USC 922t. Checks are required on nondealers other than those in certain states who have certain kinds of firearm permits see Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives Permanent Brady Permit Chart and those who have already passed an FBI background check to acquire a firearm regulated by the National Firearms Act.3 Under 18 USC 923j a dealer may conduct business at gun shows and similar events but the background check requirement in paragraph t still applies.4 The Brady Act was enacted on November 30 1993 and took effect on February 28 1994. It initially required that firearm dealers inform the relevant state or local law enforcement agency of a person s intention to acquire a handgun and required that said agency conduct a background check on the individual within five state government business days. The Supreme Court struck down the latter requirement on Tenth Amendment grounds in Printz v. United States 1997. The Act further required that as of November 30 1998 the handgun checkwaiting period requirement would cease in favor of what is now known as the National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS.5 Michael Planty and Jennifer Truman Firearm Violence 19932011 Bureau of Justice Statistics BJS May 2013 p. 13.

The Gun Violence Archive defines a mass shooting as a shooting in which 4 or more shot or killed not including the shooter.  Those are also the three recent mass shootings in the U.S. that have received widespread national media coverage and have renewed calls for expanded gun regulations including background checks even from some who generally support gun ownership. For example several performers dropped out of the National Rifle Association s annual convention held May 27 in Houston three days after the Uvalde shooting. Country and gospel singer Larry Gatlin withdrew saying he agrees with most of the positions held by the NRA but has come to believe that while background checks would not stop every madman with a gun it is at the very least a step in the right direction toward trying to prevent the kind of tragedy we saw this week in Uvalde in my beloved weeping Texas.  Here we update our summary of academic research on background checks originally published in 2019 with the latest analyses. In general academic studies do not show that background checks alone for firearm purchases substantially reduce firearm deaths. Instead research suggests universal background checks can be effective when combined with licensing strategies such as permittopurchase. With permittopurchase a gun buyer must pass a background check to obtain a permit to then purchase a firearm. The phrase universal background checks typically refers to a broad regulatory framework in which all legal gun buyers would be subject to a criminal and mental health background check before completing a gun purchase. Right now for certain gun sales in certain states sellers do not have to run a background check on customers. This is sometimes called the gunshow loophole.  People buying from federally licensed dealers at gun shows do need to pass a background check. But direct private sales between people living in the same state such as private sales at gun shows or online do not require a background check though 14 states plus the District of Columbia require universal background checks for all types of gun sales. Three states Hawaii Illinois and Massachusetts require buyers to have gun permits which are only issued after a background check is completed. The Gun Control Act of 1968 was the first federal legislation that aimed to track firearm commerce. It established the federal licensing system for firearms dealers. The act applies to people who sell guns as a business. The Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986 limited the federal government s authority in enforcing the Gun Control Act. For example the Firearm Owners Protection Act limits how often federal agents can inspect gun dealers for violations. The Firearm Owners Protection Act also makes clear that private sales are precluded from regulation A person who engages in occasional sales exchanges or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms doesn t need a federal license according to the 1986 act. The national instant criminal background check system or NICS was established in 1998 as part of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act sometimes called the Brady Act Brady Bill or Brady Law which President Bill Clinton signed in 1993. The law was named for and championed by James Brady onetime press secretary to President Ronald Reagan. Brady was shot in the head in March 1981 during an assassination attempt on Reagan. Brady lived with physical disabilities for the rest of his life. His death in 2014 was ruled a homicide. The Brady Law imposed a fiveday waiting period before a licensed dealer could transfer a handgun to a buyer. This provision expired as intended in 1998. A permanent provision that went into force that year established the federal background check system that now exists. The Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives is responsible for enforcing federal gun control legislation. The FBI runs background checks. There are 37 jurisdictions in which sellers contact the FBI directly for checks. In 13 states state agencies conduct checks by electronically accessing the NICS. The rest of the states have a mix of checks that either the state or FBI conducts depending on the type of gun being purchased. Federally licensed and private vendors both sell at gun shows. An analysis of how gun owners got their firearms published in 2017 in the Annals of Internal Medicine included 1613 adult gun owners who took a nationally representative webbased survey. This survey found 22 of participants obtained firearms within the last two years without a background check. News outlets and academic researchers regularly cite this survey as the best available estimate. The analysis was primarily funded by organizations that support stricter gun control but the authors note in their paper that the funders did not play a role in the design conduct or reporting of the research or in the decision to submit the manuscript for publication.  Gun buyers are more likely to undergo a background check in states that have background check laws compared with states that do not according to February 2022 research in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. Another survey conducted in 2018 among 2558 adults in California and published in Preventive Medicine found 17 of firearm owners who purchased their most recent firearm within California in 1991 or later following implementation of the state s comprehensive background check law reported doing so without a background check.  Yes research suggests most Americans want some form of government regulation determining whether someone buying a gun is eligible to do so. A Pew Research poll of 5109 U.S. adults conducted in April 2021 finds 87 of gun owners and 88 of nongun owners think people with mental illnesses should not be able to buy guns while 72 of gun owners and 87 of nongun owners think gun show sales and private gun sales should be subject to background checks. The same poll finds 70 of Republicans and 92 of Democrats favor subjecting private gun sales and gun show sales to background checks. Support for other proposals like assault weapons bans or a federal database to track gun sales tend to fall along partisan lines with Democrats more widely supportive than Republicans according to Pew. Similarly the authors of an August 2021 paper in Preventive Medicine studied two rounds of the John Hopkins National Survey of Gun Policy from January 2017 and January 2019 with 3804 U.S. adults responding. They find broad support for background checks and licensing across races and ethnicities. Some 76 of white 77 of Black and 78 of Hispanic respondents favor requiring gun buyers to get a license from local law enforcement prior to purchase. And 89 of white 82 of Black and 88 of Hispanic respondents favor background checks for all gun sales the paper finds. The ATF keeps an updated list of state gun laws. Identifying information on federal background check records are destroyed within 24 hours after the check is completed if the check shows the individual is allowed to own a gun. This period was previously 90 days but the Department of Justice shortened the period to no more than 24 hours in the mid2000s. Five states Connecticut Hawaii Massachusetts New Jersey and New York do not prohibit municipalities from enacting their own gun laws. The FBI has completed roughly 425 million firearm background checks since 1998. It conducted about 39 million checks in 2020 and 2021 each up substantially from 28 million in 2019 and 26 million in 2018. There are 12 reasons the FBI denies gun sales. From November 1998 through May 2022 the FBI denied nearly 2.1 million gun sales. About half of those denials were because the potential purchaser had been convicted of a crime punishable by more than one year in prison or a misdemeanor punishable by more than two years. If the FBI cannot complete a background check within three days a federally licensed dealer may but isn t required to complete the sale. From 2006 to 2015 there were roughly 6700 guns sold to people with domestic violence records after the FBI did not meet the threeday deadline according to an analysis from the Government Accountability Office. Several states allow the threeday federal deadline to be extended. The number of firearms sold after the threeday deadline to people who should have been denied has doubled in recent years according to a Wall Street Journal analysis. The U.S. Senate hasn t taken up a bill the House passed in March 2021 that would extend the deadline to at least 10 days. Gun buyers denied on the regulated gun market may turn to the unregulated market. Some threequarters of people incarcerated for gun crimes got their firearms from someone who did not legally have to conduct a background check according to a 2017 review of research and state gun laws published in the Journal of Law Medicine and Ethics. An analysis of a nationally representative survey of 1444 gun owners conducted in 2016 and published in Preventive Medicine in June 2021 parsed 238 respondents who had also sold a firearm in a private sale. Less than half 46 of those private gun sellers thought they bore responsibility for checking if their buyers were eligible to buy guns. To recap some legal gun sales are regulated others are not. Around onefifth of legal gun sales are unregulated according to the latest research. Gun buyers are more likely to undergo a background check in states that have background check laws. A gun store owner has to be federally licensed run background checks on customers and record firearm sales. Someone conducting a private gun sale online doesn t need to run a background check or record the sale. Licensed and unlicensed vendors sell side by side at gun shows. Another bill the U.S. House passed in March 2021 would require background checks for private sales. The Senate has not taken up that bill either. One of the first studies to look into the Brady Law was published in August 2000 in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The authors analyzed firearm homicides and suicide rates from 1985 to 1997 in the 32 states that did not already have comparable legislation. As a control they also analyzed those rates in the 18 states with similar legislation. Homicide and suicide rates didn t change much after the law was enacted the authors found. Only the rate of firearm suicides for people aged 55 and older declined. This relationship was particularly evident in states with waiting periods and background checks as opposed to only background checks. In a blog post the authors characterize the Brady Law as having a useful but modest effect on keeping guns out of the hands of people who the federal government prohibits from having them. They note that the secondary gun market is unregulated as it remains today. A task force of doctors from government agencies and academia in 2005 published a comprehensive literature review in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine on whether firearm laws reduce violence. The authors found four studies including the one mentioned above from JAMA that explored background checks. They note that the suicide reduction observed among people age 55 and older seems linked to waiting periods and not necessarily to felony restrictions. Another early study published in 1999 in the American Journal of Public Health and mentioned in the literature review found that denying handgun sales to felons was associated with a 20 to 30 lower risk of those felons committing new gunrelated or violent crimes. The JAMA and AJPH studies aren t necessarily contradictory. They simply take different approaches. The JAMA study looked at violence that happened before and after the Brady Law. The AJPH study tried to peer at the other side of the coin at violence prevented. There is not much recent federallyfunded research on gun violence. In 1996 Congress prohibited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from using federal funds to advocate or promote gun control. That means there has historically been little federal funding to examine gun violence on a national scale. But in December 2019 Congress allocated 12.5 million apiece to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health to study gun violence in fiscal year 2020. Congress made the same allocation for 2021. Results from some of those initially funded studies including a 2 million study exploring which safety strategies effectively deter school shootings could be published later this year. One academic analysis not funded by the recent federal allocations found no impact on violent crime in the two years after Massachusetts passed legislation in 2014. The law among other things expanded the reasons a prospective gun buyer could be denied a state firearm license according to the paper published in March 2021 in Justice Quarterly. The author notes that unlike California s gun control laws the Massachusetts Department of Mental Health is not required to transmit records of individuals ordered to undergo involuntary outpatient treatment which may limit the effectiveness of background checks conducted on potential buyers.  In February 2019 researchers writing in the Annals of Epidemiology examined California s longstanding background check law. The authors looked at elements of the law that require criminal background checks for almost all gun sales in the state and prevent nearly everyone convicted of violent misdemeanors from buying a firearm for a decade. There was no association between those rules and changes in the firearm homicide rate in California according to the paper. The authors note incomplete data and potential lack of enforcement could affect their findings. Another study from July 2018 published in Epidemiology likewise found no apparent association between repeals of comprehensive background check laws in Indiana and Tennessee and changes in firearm suicide and homicide rates in those states. A study from 2016 published in The Lancet analyzed firearmrelated deaths in all states from 2008 to 2010. This study considered how different gun control laws 25 in all affect firearm death rates. The study was crosssectional meaning it offered a snapshot in time. The authors found that federallymandated universal background checks could reduce firearm deaths in the U.S. by 57. But behavioral scientists at RAND Corp. a nonprofit nonpartisan research and analysis organization took exception to the paper citing a number of serious analytical errors that we suspected could undermine the article s conclusions.  RAND authors Terry Schell and Andrew Morral write Our corrected analyses found no statistically significant evidence for any of the article s major conclusions. The lead author of The Lancet paper Bindu Kalesan and her coauthors responded describing Schell and Morral s analysis as a skewed reading of the evidence and a singular view of common sense.  The research is clearer that background checks can reduce gun violence when those checks are done in tandem with permittopurchase programs. A September 2020 paper in the American Journal of Public Health examining gun laws in four states Connecticut Maryland Missouri and Pennsylvania found no clear association between background checks alone and firearm deaths but licensing laws coupled with background checks requirements were consistently associated with lower firearm homicide and suicide rates the authors write. A June 2018 study in the Journal of Urban Health found that for large urban counties permittopurchase laws were associated with a 14 drop in firearm homicides. Comprehensive background checks alone meanwhile were associated with increases in firearm homicide in large urban areas. The permitting process may include a more thorough background check which law enforcement can take 30 days or more to complete the authors write. Connecticut implemented a permittopurchase law in 1995. Over the next decade the law was associated with a 40 drop in firearm homicide rates according to August 2015 research in the American Journal of Public Health. In Missouri firearm homicide rates increased 23 in the three years after Missouri repealed its permittopurchase requirement in 2007 according to an April 2014 study in the Journal of Urban Health.  Given the body of evidence on the effectiveness of licensing laws and the increasing levels of support among the population including gun owners policy makers should consider handgun purchaser licensing as a complement to comprehensive background check laws conclude Johns Hopkins University researchers Cassandra Crifasi Alexander McCourt and Daniel Webster in their June 2019 white paper on permittopurchase programs. A January 2020 study in Pediatrics is one notable exception to the findings on background checks plus permittopurchase programs being more effective than background checks alone. The authors examined responses from nearly 180000 high school students covering 1993 to 2017 from the Youth Risk Behavior Survey which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducts every other year. An average of nearly 6 of the youth surveyed across the years reported carrying a gun during the past month. But just 17 of them were from states with universal background checks 83 were from states without those checks. While the authors studied youth gun carrying not gun violence they note that access to guns generally increases risk of injury or death. Absent national policy some states have sought to regulate gun purchases but those laws may be less effective when neighboring states have looser policies. A May 2022 study in Preventive Medicine examined the prevalence of gun shows in 2018 across 3107 counties in the contiguous U.S. Gun shows the authors find cluster in counties next to states that have universal background checks. Our results provide evidence that proximity to states without universal background check laws inherently supports gun trafficking the authors write. Likewise a July 2021 paper in the Journal of Injury and Violence Research finds the reduction in firearm homicides in counties in states with background check or permit laws is muted when those counties lie near states without those regulations. Team owners looking to build or revamp big league sports stadiums often seek public funds in the hundreds of millions of dollars. But research conducted over decades indicates these investments almost never lead to massive economic gains for host cities. A big reason voter registration rates vary so much in the U.S. is because states have their own election policies and processes which can make registering easy or difficult. Election offices also differ in how they educate voters. People incarcerated for felony convictions lose the right to vote across most of the U.S. but specifics vary widely by state.

https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/background-checks.html, Background checks for gun purchases are designed to prevent access to guns by convicted felons and other prohibited possessors such as minors fugitives from justice those who live in the United States illegally individuals who use controlled substances those with certain histories of mental illness those who have been dishonorably discharged from the military those who have renounced their U.S. citizenship those subject to a restraining order and those convicted of domestic violence offenses 18 U.S.C. 922. The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act the Brady Act which went into effect in 1994 imposed federal requirements for background checks on sales by licensed dealers 18 U.S.C. 922 but not for private sales or transfers of firearms such as gifts. Several states have expanded this federal requirement to mandate that background checks be conducted for all firearm sales and transfers including those between private parties. Such laws are referred to as universal background check laws. We found no qualifying studies showing that background checks increased any of the eight gun use outcomes we investigated. Background check laws seek to prevent firearm purchases by individuals thought to be at high risk of presenting a danger to themselves or others. By restricting the means by which dangerous individuals could otherwise access guns these laws are designed to reduce gun crime and violence. Universal background check laws make background checks a requirement for all or nearly all transfers of firearms thereby extending the federal background check requirements that apply only to transactions between a gun dealer a federal firearm licensee and a buyer to transactions between private parties. While compliance is likely to be imperfect a universal background check may still reduce gunrelated homicides or suicides by deterring prohibited possessors from attempting to acquire firearms or by making it harder or more expensive for them to succeed in doing so. Universal background checks may also reduce illegal gun trafficking. For instance Webster Vernick and Bulzacchelli 2009 found that fewer crime guns originally purchased out of state came from states with universal background checks than from states with no background checks for private firearm sales.1 The magnitude of the effects of such laws will be influenced in part by the level of enforcement and the availability of firearms through alternative markets such as illegal markets or legal markets in states without background checks for private transactions. Law effects are also likely to be moderated by preexisting levels of gun ownership because most firearms are purchased by individuals who already own a firearm. Azrael et al. 2017 found that on average gun owners had close to five firearms each and a large majority 62 percent purchased their most recent weapon from a licensed gun dealer. For those who already own guns a background check requirement may have little or no effect on crime or suicide risk. There are no routinely collected data on how individuals obtain guns but a 2019 national survey of gun owners who obtained a firearm within the previous five years found that 21 percent had purchased or received as a gift or an inheritance their most recent firearm without undergoing a background check Hepburn Azrael and Miller 2022. For firearms purchased through private sources 66 percent were acquired without a background check this percentage was higher in states without comprehensive background check laws than in states with such laws 74 percent versus 40 percent respectively Hepburn Azrael and Miller 2022. Obtaining firearms from private sources is likely substantially more common among prohibited possessors. Indeed a 2016 survey of state prison inmates found that among those who possessed a gun during the offense for which they were imprisoned only 8 percent purchased or traded the weapon from a licensed dealer whereas 70 percent acquired it from a friend family member or street source such as an illicit broker Alper and Glaze 2019. Of those who obtained their firearms from a licensed dealer the majority more than 80 percent reported that a background check was conducted Alper and Glaze 2019. Using information from the 2004 version of the same survey and restricting the sample to 13 states considered by the authors to have lessrestrictive firearm regulations another study found that more than 40 percent of inmates who acquired their gun from a friend family member or street source had a disqualifying condition e.g. prior felony conviction dishonorable discharge under age 18 that should have prohibited them from obtaining the firearm had they undergone a background check Vittes Vernick and Webster 2012. Universal background check policies may do little to limit existing illegal sources of firearms to criminal offenders Kopel 2016 and background check policies on their own can at best prevent such individuals only from acquiring new firearms not from maintaining possession of those they owned before becoming a prohibited possessor. However if the implementation and enforcement of such policies is successful in stemming the flow of new firearms to criminal markets universal background check laws could reduce gun crime by increasing the price of firearms in the secondary markets on which criminals mostly rely Cook Molliconi and Cole 1995. The effects of background check policies will hinge on multiple factors including whether the disqualifying conditions checked for are accurate indicators of risk and the completeness of records accessible by the background check system. The excess risk of firearm violence attributable to prohibited individuals is unknown. Although research has shown that most violent offenders have previous involvement with the criminal justice system Wright and Wintemute 2010 Cook Ludwig and Braga 2005 Kleck and Bordua 1983 and that individuals with severe mental disorders are at elevated risk of suicide Chesney Goodwin and Fazel 2014 see also our essay on mental health care access and suicide it is unclear the extent to which related disqualifying indicators assessed in the background check process e.g. prior felony convictions adjudicated mental health problems adequately proxy for this risk. Furthermore the primary database used to conduct background checks the Federal Bureau of Investigations FBIs National Instant Criminal Background Check System NICS fails to accurately capture all disqualifying conditions. The NICS is composed of information from three distinct data sources the National Crime Information Center the Interstate Identification Index and the NICS Indices which capture convictions for relevant prohibiting crimes along with information about mental health adjudications and domestic violence incidents. In 2021 411575054 background checks were conducted through NICS and of those 153565 were denied Criminal Justice Information Services Division 2022. Although NICS records are expansive including more than 25 million active records on prohibited possessors as of 2021 states and court staff struggle to keep NICS records up to date Criminal Justice Information Services Division 2022 Goggins and Gallegos 2016. Pressure on FBI staff also might lead to checks taking longer than three days at which point in some states a person is automatically approved Smucker et al. 2022. Gaps in the underlying database used by NICS and by state background check systems undermine the effectiveness of the policy. One study found that of the 240 mass shooting incidents between 2009 and 2020 one in three involved a prohibited possessor Everytown for Gun Safety Support Fund 2021. In contrast recent studies of mass public shootings found that most of the shooters purchased at least one of their weapons legally and with a federal background check Buchanan et al. 2018 Peterson and Densley 2022. In assessing background check policies the ideal analyses would estimate effects on outcomes specifically for those populations or individuals whose access to firearms became restricted under the regulations. For instance to study the impact on suicide of background check laws that disqualify individuals with some histories of mental illness one would like to estimate how after the law was implemented suicide rates changed specifically among individuals newly prohibited by the law. Similarly data on the price of firearms in secondary and illegal markets would be valuable for understanding whether background check laws or their expansion to new populations of prohibited possessors cause access to firearms in secondary markets to become restricted. However there are numerous challenges to undertaking this type of analysis because most data sources available to researchers lack detailed information on the characteristics of criminal offenders or suicide victims beyond age gender and raceethnicity. The National Violent Death Reporting System is an important exception when that information is known. In some cases e.g. restraining orders an individual may be only temporarily prohibited from possessing a firearm and in the case of crime outcomes details on the criminal offender can be known only if the perpetrator is known. See the discussion of data limitations in the essay on improving gun policy science. Given these challenges it is unsurprising that most of the articles meeting our inclusion criteria for this policy did not use these types of data. Nevertheless two studies Swanson et al. 2013 Swanson et al. 2016 were able to merge administrative records from public health and criminal justice agencies to focus on violent crime outcomes for individuals with disqualifying mental health histories.  DC   MA   NH   NC   SC   WV   DC   MA   NH   NC   SC   WV  As of January 1 2021 14 states and the District of Columbia have comprehensive background check laws that require checks at the point of transfer for all firearms.2 Even within these states there are some differences in the laws. For example California Colorado Delaware Nevada New Mexico New York Washington and the District of Columbia require that all transfers to individuals with some minor exceptions are processed through licensed dealers who conduct the background checks.3 Somewhat similarly Oregon requires all transfers and background checks to be processed through dealers except that sellers at gun shows may request background checks directly with the Department of State Police.4 Three more states Maryland New Jersey and Pennsylvania have the same universal background check requirements but they are applicable only to handguns.5 Other states require background checks before law enforcement can issue a permit to purchase. Five states and the District of Columbia have promulgated such laws for all firearms6 while six states have such laws for handguns only.7 Under these laws firearms or handguns in the latter six states may not be purchased without permits but the permitting systems and rules differ. For example in Hawaii a permit for a handgun must be used within ten days of receipt and a new permit must be issued for each handgun transfer.8 In Illinois however a permit lasts ten years.9 Furthermore some states allow exceptions for those who hold permits to carry or concealedcarry permits which may have longer durations than the permits to purchase.10 View the full project bibliography

Giffords is an organization dedicated to saving lives from gun violence. Led by former Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords we inspire the courage of people from all walks of life to make America safer. Universal background checks are essential to close deadly loopholes in our laws that allow millions of guns to end up in the hands of individuals at an elevated risk of committing violence each year. Though more than 90 of the American public supports background checks for all gun sales a dangerous and deadly loophole in federal gun laws still exempts unlicensed sellers from having to perform any background check whatsoever before selling a firearm. With this loophole guns easily find their way into the hands of illegal buyers and gun traffickers dramatically increasing the likelihood of gun homicides and suicides. Matthew Miller Lisa Hepburn and Deborah Azrael Firearm Acquisition Without Background Checks Results of a National Survey Annals of Internal Medicine 166 no. 4 2017 233 239. A dangerous gap in our federal gun laws lets people buy guns without passing a background check. Under current law unlicensed sellers people who sell guns online at gun shows or anywhere else without a federal dealer s license can transfer firearms without having to run any background check whatsoever. Because of this loophole people who are subject to domestic violence convictions or court orders people who have been convicted of violent crimes and people ineligible to possess firearms for mental health reasons can easily buy guns from unlicensed sellers with no background check in most states. In fact an estimated 22 of US gun owners acquired their most recent firearm without a background check1 which translates to millions of Americans acquiring millions of guns no questions asked each year. When background checks are required and properly enforced they can block illegal gun sales and keep deadly weapons out of the hands of people with the most significant histories of violence or irresponsible behavior. However in the absence of a comprehensive background check system people who are ineligible to possess firearms routinely exploit the massive loopholes in our laws. Recent examples show that loopholes in our background check system can have dangerous and deadly consequences. Background checks are easy convenient and impose almost no burden on lawabiding gun purchasers. For more than a decade the vast majority of the American public has supported laws requiring background checks on all firearm purchases13 with polling data consistently showing that more than 90 of both gun owners and nongun owners support this policy.14 Strong support for background check laws has also been measured among NRA members with at least 69 supporting comprehensive background checks.15 Universal background checks are a necessary foundation for any policy that aims to keep firearms out of the hands of people convicted of domestic abuse and other ineligible people. However other improvements should also be made in the existing background check system. For further information on how federal and state background checks work see our pages on Background Check Procedures and Reporting Procedures. Federal law imposes various duties on federally licensed firearms dealers. Firearms dealers must among other things Federal law imposes none of these requirements on unlicensed sellers however. The Gun Control Act of 1968 provides that persons engaged in the business of dealing in firearms must be licensed.17 Although Congress did not originally define the term engaged in the business it did so in 1986 as part of the McClureVolkmer Act also known as the Firearms Owners Protection Act. That Act defined the term engaged in the business as applied to a firearms dealer as a person who devotes time attention and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business with the principal objective of livelihood and profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. In 2022 the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act made a minor change to the definition replacing with the principal objective of livelihood and profit with to predominantly earn a profit. 18 Current law now defines engaged in the business as applied to a firearms dealer as a person who devotes time attention and labor to dealing in firearms as a regular course of trade or business to predominantly earn a profit through the repetitive purchase and resale of firearms. 19 We re in this together. To build a safer America one where children and parents in every neighborhood can learn play work and worship without fear of gun violence we need you standing beside us in this fight. Significantly the 1986 McClureVolkmer Act also defined engaged in the business to exclude a person who makes occasional sales exchanges or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms. 20 According to a 1999 report issued by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives the 1986 definition of engaged in the business often frustrates the prosecution of unlicensed dealers masquerading as collectors or hobbyists but who are really trafficking firearms to felons or other prohibited persons. 21 The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act did not address this exclusion. Twentyone states and Washington DC have extended the background check requirement beyond federal law to at least some gun sales from unlicensed sellers.  Eighteen states California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Nevada New Jersey New Mexico New York Oregon Rhode Island Vermont Virginia and Washington and the District of Columbia generally require universal background checks for all sales of all classes of firearms whether they are purchased from a licensed dealer or an unlicensed seller.22 Most of these states background check laws apply both to sales and other nontemporary firearm transfers although laws enacted in New Mexico and Virginia exempt transfers that are not made for a fee or other remuneration.  In addition Pennsylvania requires point of sale background checks for handguns but not for long guns like rifles and shotguns. Instead of or in addition to a point of sale background check seven states Connecticut Hawaii Illinois Massachusetts Michigan New Jersey and Oregon require all firearm purchasers to obtain a permit issued after a background check in order to be qualified to acquire any firearm.23 Illinois also requires unlicensed sellers to contact the State Police at the point of sale to verify the that the transferee s firearms license remains valid and requires the State Police to continuously monitor relevant databases to ensure that license holders remain eligible to keep their firearm license.24New Jersey and Oregon require firearm purchasers to both obtain a permit to purchase a firearm and if the purchase is from an unlicensed seller conduct the transaction through a federallylicensed firearms dealer.25 Nebraska has this permit and background check requirement for the purchase of handguns but not long guns and as of August 1 2023 Minnesota requires a permit and background check for handgun and assault weapon purchases from unlicensed sellers.  The most immediate approach to ensuring that guns are not sold to ineligible people requires a background check to be completed by a licensed dealer or law enforcement at the point that any firearm is sold or transferred to another owner. Processing these transfers through licensed dealers or law enforcement helps to ensure that a background check will be conducted prior to any transfer. States that Require a Background Check at the Point of Transfer California Colorado Delaware Maryland Nevada New Jersey New York Oregon Vermont and Washington generally require all firearm transfers to be conducted by or processed through licensed dealers who conduct background checks on prospective firearm purchasers or recipients. In the District of Columbia firearms may be sold and transferred only by or to a licensed dealer. Rhode Island requires all sellers to obtain a completed application form from the prospective purchaser and to submit the form to law enforcement for purposes of conducting a background check. Connecticut requires any person transferring a firearm to either submit a form to law enforcement or conduct the transfer through a licensed dealer so that a background check is conducted for every sale or transfer. Pennsylvania requires a background check for every prospective handgun sale or transfer and provides that the background check may be conducted either by a licensed dealer or a designated law enforcement agency. New Mexico and Virginia require background checks for firearms sales but not for other types of transfers such as gifts or longterm loans. Both states require that the background check be conducted through a licensed firearms dealer.42 Gun violence is a complex problem and while there s no onesizefitsall solution we must act. Our reports bring you the latest cuttingedge research and analysis about strategies to end our country s gun violence crisis at every level. Twelve states and the District of Columbia impose background checks on purchasers of some or all firearms through a permitting or licensing system. In these states a purchaser must obtain a permit that includes a background check in order to purchase a firearm. Depending on the state these permits may be valid for as short as 10 days or as long as 10 years. State licensing requirements are discussed in greater detail on our licensing policy page. While these requirements ensure that a background check has been conducted at some point prior to purchase a person may fall within a prohibited category after the license or permit is issued but before the time the person attempts to purchase a firearm. As a result licensing laws alone do not necessarily prevent ineligible people from accessing firearms. States with the most comprehensive laws require purchasers to obtain a permit and also require a background check at the point of sale to ensure that a purchaser has not fallen into a prohibited category after he or she obtained the permit. States that Require a Background Check to Purchase from Unlicensed Sellers through a Permit Requirement California and Washington achieve universal background checks through point of transfer checks but both states additionally require purchasers to obtain a firearm safety certificate that does not require a background check.

A loophole in federal law that does not require background checks on sales of guns by unlicensed individuals is often referred to as the gun show loophole. This is somewhat misleading however as sales of firearms by unlicensed individuals can occur anywhere not just at gun shows. Unless a state has closed this loophole unlicensed sellers are not required by federal law to conduct background checks on buyers whether the sale occurs at a gun show or over the internet through a site like armslist.com. See our page on Interstate and Online Gun Sales for more information about sales conducted over the internet.  Currently 21 states and the District of Columbia require background checks on sales of some or all types of firearms by unlicensed individuals whether the sale occurs at a gun show or elsewhere. For more information about the regulation of gun shows see our summary on Gun Shows. The features listed below are intended to provide a framework from which policy options may be considered. Any jurisdiction considering new legislation should consult with counsel.  Our laws contain notable gaps that allow individuals who have demonstrated a significant risk of violence to possess firearms.   Americans overwhelmingly support background checks for all gun sales to prevent individuals who have become prohibited under state and federal laws from possessing guns.   Increased oversight of gun dealers is critical to prevent irresponsible and dangerous transfers of firearms.   2024Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. All Rights Reserved.
