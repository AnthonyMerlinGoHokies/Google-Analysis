Likewise if what we re seeking is to protect the fetus criminalization has never been effective in this regard. Protection can be achieved through public policy that is also consistent with women s rights such as comprehensive health services that include preabortion counseling.Highly restrictive abortion laws do not result in lower rates of abortion. For instance in Western Europe where abortion is generally permitted the abortion rate is 12 per every 1000 women of fertile age. In Africa and Latin America where abortion is illegal in most circumstances in the majority of countries the rate is 29 per 1000 women and 32 per 1000 respectively. Criminalization only results in Clandestine abortions Unsafe abortions Higher mortality rates for poor and young women  Lack of equal access to safe and dignified health services for women experiencing undesired pregnancy is discriminatory because it only violates the rights of women. It goes against Articles 1 and 12 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW. The State s failure to guarantee the equal exercise of reproductive rights violates women s rights to life health physical mental and moral integrity autonomy intimacy dignity and the right to freedom from cruel inhuman and degrading treatment. According to the UN Special Rapporteur on the right to health Anand Grover the enactment or enforcement of laws that penalize abortion may constitute a violation of the State s obligation to respect protect and fulfill the right to health .  As the World Health Organization WHO has pointed out in countries whose laws broadly allow abortion there are fewer complications associated with unsafe abortions than in places where legal abortion is more restricted. Nearly half of abortions worldwide are unsafe performed by persons lacking the necessary information or skills or carried out in an environment not in conformity with minimal medical standards or both WHO. Statistics indicate a correlation between the number of unsafe abortions and restrictive laws deaths associated with abortion are much more frequent in countries with highly restrictive laws 34 deaths per 100000 childbirths than in countries with less restrictive laws 1 death or less per 100000 childbirths. Therefore the criminalization of abortion does not result in fewer abortions but rather in more unsafe abortions.  Abortion does not endanger women s health. For example in Uruguay the number of complications and deaths associated with abortion were reduced to zero after the Law on Voluntary Interruption of Pregnancy passed in 2012. Unsafe abortion on the other hand is a severe public health problem involving serious risks to the health and life of thousands of women. Worldwide the latest evidence from 2014 indicates that between 8 and 18 of maternal deaths are caused by unsafe abortions meaning that the number of deaths associated with abortion ranges between 22500 and 44000. In Latin America 95 of abortions were carried out in unsafe conditions a figure that did not vary between 1995 and 2008. Nearly all safe abortions were performed in the Caribbean where they are allowed by law and are readily accessible especially in Cuba.  Many women who have the right to a legal safe abortion but cannot access one due to the stigma associated with the practice. Stereotypes regarding maternity and the social construct around abortion lead to discrimination against women who make decisions about their own reproductive capacity. The illegal interventions of judicial officials lawyers and health professionals impede access to legal abortion and push women to resort to clandestine abortions. Some of the obstacles they face include bad faith from some professionals and public officials ignorance of existing legislation lack of legal information by health professionals who fear legal penalties abuse of conscientious objection tolerated by the State disparaging comments from healthcare personnel and institutional violence against women in these situations.  The estimated percentage of l deaths due to unsafe abortions is between 8 and 18. Deaths associated with abortion in 2014 ranged from 22500 to 44000. Complications arising from abortion have decreased in recent years for different reasons access to abortion with medication training programs for health service providers and the development of health care systems in general. However the data on the impact of these changes is incomplete. Unsafe abortion is one of the principal factors affecting women s health in developing regions. Estimates from 2012 indicate that 6.9 million women or 6.9 per 1000 between ages 15 and 44 underwent care for complications related to unsafe abortions. The consequences of unsafe abortion can be noted beyond the immediate effects on a woman s health. For instance unsafe abortions can cause maternal death leaving existing children without a mother or generate longterm health problems such as infertility. According to the World Health Organization approximately 830 women die from preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth every day. Many of these deaths are caused by indirect complications that exist before pregnancy but are worsened as a consequence of the pregnancy or childbirth. Many of these deaths could have been prevented with holistic birth control policies that help prevent risky pregnancies and with counselling about the dangers of bringing complicated pregnancies to term and the right to interrupt the pregnancies under safe and legal conditions.  Women from middle and higher socioeconomic strata have access to adequate safe health care and in general do not experience postabortion complications. The less advantaged in many cases teenagers are forced to resort to clandestine interventions in precarious sanitary conditions. The high mortality rates for abortion are a lamentable reflection of discrimination against women from poor backgrounds.  Women who request a noncriminalized abortion are often victims of reproachful judgments and institutional illtreatment they are denied the request and left to their own devices urged not to abort and subjected to illegal intervention by justice officials and lawyers aiming to prevent the practice. These situations are forms of torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment as established by the Human Rights Committee in L.M.R. v. Argentina. L.M.R. is a young woman with developmental delay who had been raped and denied the noncriminalized abortion to which she was entitled. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on the matter Juan E. M ndez acknowledging that restrictions in access to abortion violate the prohibition of torture and illtreatment implored all States whose national laws authorize abortions in different circumstances to safeguard the real availability of these services without adverse consequences for the woman or healthcare personnel .  In countries with restrictive laws that limit access to abortion the market moves multi million dollar figures for clandestine abortions both through surgical abortions and the sale of misoprostol and mifepristone pills. In other words the criminalization of abortion validates a clandestine market without regulation that profits at the cost of women s lives health and autonomy.  Criminalization is not founded on protecting the life of the fetus because there are other effective ways to achieve that but is instead a form of stigmatization written into criminal codes. In addition to reinforcing stereotypes around child raising denying a woman s right to decide whether or not to become a mother and when to do so aggravates gender inequalities in education cultural economic and political life. Maintaining the criminalization of abortion goes against the construction of equal societies. A first step towards gender equality is to ensure that women are in control of their reproductive capacity including having access to contraception and safe abortion because the sovereignty of women over their own bodies is key to achieving gender equality.
https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/research-shows-access-legal-abortion-improves-womens-lives, The leaked draft US Supreme Court opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women s Health Organization would immediately restrict legal abortion access by overturning the court s 1973 Roe v. Wade decision which recognized the constitutional right to abortion. Though abortion has been debated in US politics for decades the evidence is clear access to legal abortion improves women s lives PDF. In 2016 and 2018 the Urban Institute fielded the Survey of Family Planning and Women s Lives PDF and conducted followup interviews with survey participants to understand their experiences with unplanned pregnancy birth and abortion. Findings from this work provide insights about how substantial new restrictions on abortion access would affect women s lives. Note In this post we use the term women to align with the data sources referenced but we acknowledge not all people who seek abortion identify as women. More than 8 in 10 women surveyed in 2016 said an unplanned birth would negatively affect a woman s life with more than half of women reporting a negative outcome for at least four of seven aspects of their lives. Most close to 2 in 3 worried about negative effects on a woman s education followed by concerns about her income mental health and job. Numerous studies confirm these perceptions access to legal abortion improves women s economic and social lives and being denied an abortion creates economic hardship and financial insecurity for women and their children.  Since Roe states have enacted more than 1000 laws or regulations restricting access to abortion including gestational limits waiting periods mandated preabortion counseling and prohibitions on the use of state funds. About 4 in 10 women surveyed in 2018 believed access to procedural abortion was easy but 3 in 10 believed it was difficult with medication abortion perceived as somewhat easier to access than procedural abortion. For both types women in states with more restrictive abortion policies were more likely to perceive abortion access as difficult. Though difficulty may reflect a range of factors finding a provider cost time travel logistics and emotional costs these findings suggest abortion restrictions fuel women s perceptions that access is difficult. In followup interviews women emphasized the importance of having choices when deciding whether to continue or terminate an unplanned pregnancy and described their decisions as highly personal and dependent on many factors. Nearly all interviewees in 2016 expected they would carry an unplanned pregnancy to term and raise the child yet about onethird interviewed in 2018 reported they had an abortion when faced with an unplanned pregnancy. Women in both groups worried an unplanned pregnancy would have adverse impacts on their finances income education and career as well as on their physical health and emotional wellbeing. Most 2018 interviewees all of whom had experienced an unplanned pregnancy were not immediately aware of their pregnancy and some did not make the decision to continue or terminate their pregnancy until two or more months into their pregnancy. Women thought it was important to be able to make their own decisions with enough time to consider their options before deciding. Summarized in an amicus brief PDF filed by more than 150 economists research shows access to abortion improves women s economic wellbeing. The Turnaway Study found women who received an abortion were less likely than those denied an abortion to experience financial hardship receive public assistance live in poverty or report poor or fair health. If Roe is overturned a lack of legal abortion access will cause women s overall and economic wellbeing to suffer. Women of color stand to lose the most. Already abortion restrictions in the US disproportionately harm people of color who are more likely to lack access to comprehensive reproductive health care. Multiple amicus briefs filed in support of Jackson Women s Health Organization highlight the distinct harms abortion restriction would have on Black women in particular who already face racial and socioeconomic barriers to reproductive autonomy. As of May 17 2022 22 states have laws that could be used to restrict legal abortion in the absence of Roe including 13 states with trigger laws that would effectively ban abortion laws that would take effect automatically if the protections of Roe are removed. Currently abortion is still legal in all 50 states and DC and local abortion funds and other organizations are working to help people maintain access to abortion. In Texas where abortions after about six weeks are banned women access abortion by traveling out of state or ordering abortion medication online. However if Roe v. Wade is overturned millions of women would face greater barriers to legal abortion access including traveling farther to find an abortion provider. For those unable to get an abortion evidence shows continuing an unwanted pregnancy will lead to more pregnancyrelated deaths adverse mental and physical health outcomes PDF for women and adverse social and economic outcomes PDF for women and their families.
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/06/13/about-six-in-ten-americans-say-abortion-should-be-legal-in-all-or-most-cases-2/, Abortion has long been a contentious issue in the United States and it is one that sharply divides Americans along partisan ideological and religious lines. Today a 61 majority of U.S. adults say abortion should be legal in all or most cases while 37 think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. These views are relatively unchanged in the past few years. The latest Pew Research Center survey conducted March 7 to 13 finds deep disagreement between and within the parties over abortion. In fact the partisan divide on abortion is far wider than it was two decades ago. Related Explore an interactive look at Americans attitudes on abortion. In the latest survey Democrats and Democraticleaning independents are 42 percentage points more likely than Republicans and Republican leaners to say abortion should be legal in all or most cases 80 vs. 38. This gap is little changed over the last few years but the current divide is wider than it was in the past. For instance as recently as 2016 there was a 33point gap between the shares of Democrats 72 and Republicans 39 who supported legal abortion in all or most cases. Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand Americans views on abortion. For this analysis we surveyed 10441 U.S. adults in March 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology. This wider gap is mostly attributable to a steady increase in support for legal abortion among Democrats. In 2007 roughly twothirds of Democrats and Democratic leaners 63 said abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Support among Democrats has risen by nearly 20 points since then and 80 now say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Views among Republicans have remained relatively steady during this period. In 2007 around fourinten Republicans 39 said abortion should be legal in all or most cases today 38 say this. There are ideological differences within both parties over abortion though the divide is starker within the GOP. Among Republicans and Republicanleaning independents 60 of moderates and liberals say abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared with just 27 of conservative Republicans. While liberal Democrats are 18 percentage points more likely than conservative and moderate Democrats to say abortion should be legal in all or most cases wide majorities of both groups 90 and 72 respectively say this. Support for legal abortion varies by race and ethnicity education and religious affiliation. Majorities of adults across racial and ethnic groups say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. White adults and Hispanic adults however are slightly less likely to say this than Black and Asian adults. Roughly sixinten White 59 and Hispanic adults 60 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared with larger majorities of Black 68 and Asian 74 adults. Support for legal abortion is greater among those with higher levels of education. While majorities of those with a postgraduate degree 69 bachelor s degree 64 and those with some college experience 63 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases adults with no more than a high school education are more divided on the issue 54 say abortion should be legal in at least most cases while 44 say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. White evangelical Protestants continue to be opposed to abortion in all or most cases. Nearly threequarters of White evangelicals 74 say it should be illegal in all or most cases while 24 say it should be legal in at least most cases. In contrast a majority of White Protestants who are not evangelical 60 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Religious nones those who are religiously unaffiliated overwhelmingly support legal abortion. Over eightinten 84 say it should be legal in all or most cases while just 15 say it should be illegal. Among the public overall there is a modest gender divide in views of whether abortion should be legal 58 of men and 63 of women say it should be legal in at least most cases. Within both parties the views of men and women are largely aligned. Among Democrats 80 of both men and women say abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Similarly 36 of Republican men and 39 of Republican women say the same. Note This is an update of a post originally published July 17 2017.

https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1969/06/the-right-of-abortion/303366/, For several years we have heard warnings about the population crisis. Indeed so concerned are we that there now are voices in the land calling for compulsory sterilization and compulsory birth control for the withholding of public support for illegitimate children in excess of a certain number for conditioning welfare monies or parole or whatever on coerced sterilization and so on. Yet little is done to make sterilization easily available on a voluntary basis particularly to the poor and underprivileged. Despite the lack of legal strictures against it it is often withheld by doctors and hospitals from those who need it and want it most. At the same time there begins to appear on the part of some an alarming readiness to subordinate rights of freedom of choice in the area of human reproduction to governmental coercion. Notwithstanding all this we continue to maintain strict antiabortion laws on the books of at least four fifths of our states denying freedom of choice to women and physicians and compelling the unwilling to bear the unwanted. Yet as Doctor Christopher Tietze and Sarah Lewit point out in the Scientific American for January 1969 Abortion is still the most widespread method of fertility control in the modern world. According to experts who participated in a United Nations Conference on World Population in Belgrade in 1965 abortion is indeed the chief method of birth control in the world today and they estimated that about 30 million pregnancies are purposely terminated by abortion each year. Of these studies indicate that almost one million are in the United States. Since however abortions are still so difficult to obtain we force the birth of millions more unwanted children every year. If we really want to cut our population growth rate on a voluntary basis we should make abortion available on a voluntary basis at least in the early stages of pregnancy. When Japan liberalized its abortion laws some years back it halved its rate of population growth in a decade. I do not recommend abortion as a birthcontrol method of choice. I merely state that it is in fact the most important single method of birth control in the world today and to cut down on population growth we should make abortion easy and safe while we continue to develop other and more satisfactory methods of family limitation. In addition to the 5 million women in the United States without access to birth control for whom abortion would seem a matter of right when they want it there are the uncounted thousands who after conception suffer some disease like German measles or discover some defect which makes the birth of a live and healthy baby unlikely and the many too whose contraceptive methods occasionally don t work. As the New York chapter of the National Organization for Women notes in a pamphlet There is no perfect contraceptive. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration reports that the intrauterine devices one of the most effective contraceptives available today have a failure rate of 1.5 to 3. This means that if all married women in the United States could and did use these contraceptives there would still be about 350000 to 700000 unwanted pregnancies a year among married women alone. Even sterilization is not a 100 effective method of contraception some operations fail. Therefore in order to insure a complete and thorough birth control program abortion must be made available as a legal right to all women who request it. Starting in the mid1960s some erosion of the antiabortion laws began to take place. But these efforts have not been supported by many of the more vocal groups who are trying to do something about excess population growth to them compulsory birth control and compulsory sterilization are apparently more palatable than voluntary abortion. The result is legal chaos which has been the situation with reference to abortion since it was first made illegal in this country. Contrary to popular belief the legal strictures against abortion are of comparatively recent origin. Until the early nineteenth century at common law both in England and the United States abortion before quickening was not illegal at all. It became so only in the early 1800s. And according to Professor Cyril Means and others who have studied the problem the reason for the enactment of the laws was not protection of morals or of the soul of the fetus but rather a reflection of the fact that at the time all surgical procedures were highly risky because of the probability of infection this was before Lister. Abortions were made illegal for this reason except where they were necessary to save the life of the mother that is where the great risk of infection which every operation involved was outweighed by the risk of carrying that particular pregnancy to term. The situation is today reversed abortion under modern hospital conditions is safer than childbirth. Nor is there any evidence that abortion involves psychological health hazards. A poll of the American Psychiatric Association in the mid1960s revealed overwhelming support for more easily available abortions and a conviction that adverse psychological sequelae from abortion are negligible both on an absolute standard and as compared with such sequelae from childbirth and unwanted children. Though the population experts have not yet aligned themselves on the side of abortionlaw reform something is beginning to happen. Seven states Arkansas California Colorado Georgia Maryland New Mexico and North Carolina have amended their laws to permit abortion not only to save life but also to protect the health mental and physical of the mother in cases of rape and incest and to avert the birth of defective offspring Governor Reagan forced the omission of this ground in the California law. Many other states have been and are now considering abortion reform or repeal bills but usually without the support of the powerful groups who are backing other forms of population control. The old laws are also beginning to face challenges in the courts and are being attacked on a variety of constitutional grounds. The relevant statistics have been widely circulated for example of therapeutic that is inhospital abortions in New York City in the early sixties the majority of them for psychiatric reasons 93 percent were performed on white patients 91 percent in private rooms. The ratio of inhospital abortions to live births in New York City was approximately one to 360 for private patients and something like one to 10000 in municipal hospitals. At the same time the women whose deaths were associated with abortion in New York City in a typical year were 56 percent black 23 percent Puerto Rican and 21 percent white. The 8000 to 10000 inhospital abortions contrast of course with the estimated one million performed outside hospitals annually. Probably not much more than one half of these are performed by doctors the rest by the kindly neighbor the close friend or the woman herself. Generally speaking the laws do not distinguish in their prohibitions of abortions between doctors and nondoctors. Moreover the outofhospital abortions performed by doctors are obtained by the same group which accounts for the bulk of the inhospital abortions the middle and upperincome white woman who can afford the hundreds or thousands charged for expert medical service outside the law. And these are the same women who can afford to go to Japan Sweden England or one of the Iron Curtain countries where abortions are legal and where they typically cost something between 10 and 25. But most of the old laws on abortion remain unchanged on the statute books. In a few states like Connecticut or Missouri the law says that the abortion may be performed to save the life of the child as well as that of the mother although no one is sure what this means. As a matter of fact no one knows what the laws which permit abortion to save the life of the mother mean. Courts in a number of states have held that the danger to life need not be either imminent or certain. But how imminent or certain ? Is it enough that the pregnancy if it comes to term will seriously damage the mother s health? Or will result in the birth of defective offspring? Clearly a number of doctors think the answer to these questions is yes since abortions especially on white women with good incomes are routinely and openly performed in some hospitals in most states and the prosecuting authorities do nothing about it. Criminal laws like these the meaning of which people must guess at are open to constitutional attack on this ground as the United States Supreme Court has often held with respect to other vague prohibitions. There are many other grounds of constitutional challenge as well the rights of women rich and poor black and white to equal protection of the law that is to get proper medical treatment without discrimination on the grounds of race color or income the rights of physicians to do their professional duty in the light of what is known and believed by medical science today the right of privacy declared by the United States Supreme Court in the Connecticut birthcontrol case where Sir Justice Goldberg in his concurring opinion stated that compulsory pro or antibirthcontrol laws are equally totalitarian and unconstitutional the right to be free of cruel and unusual punishment and others. Also it may well be that some courts faced with the unconscionable dilemma posed by the abortion laws and unwilling to resort to constitutional grounds will interpret the laws out of existence eventually as has happened to the federal birthcontrol laws. So why do the abortion laws stay on the books? One reason is the apparent inability or unwillingness of those who advocate population limitation to see the connection. This does not apply to Planned ParenthoodWorld Population which in November 1968 passed resolutions calling for repeal of the abortion laws in support of its declared policy of voluntary parenthood. By 1968 almost all the major religious groups in the United States except the Roman Catholic Church were on record in favor of abortionlaw reform or repeal. The American Baptist Convention and the UniversalistUnitarian Church came out for total repeal. And public opinion polls demonstrated that a majority of people including a majority of the Catholics asked about the issue favored at least some liberalization of the laws. But the opposition of the Catholic Church is potent and well organized. The Church holds that the fetus is ensouled at conception. In his encyclical Humanae Vitae in July of 1968 Pope Paul said We must once again declare that the direct interruption of the generative process already begun and above all directly willed and procured abortion even if for therapeutic reasons are to be absolutely excluded as licit means of regulating birth. italics added. To this unequivocal statement which is of course not the law in any American state since all states permit abortion at least to save the life of the mother the Pope adds an Appeal to Public Authorities. He says To Rulers who are those principally responsible for the common good and who can do so much to safeguard moral customs we say Do not allow the morality of your people to be degraded do not permit that by legal means practices contrary to the natural and divine law be introduced into that fundamental cell the Family. May all responsible public authorities as some are already doing so laudably generously revive their efforts. I submit that insofar as this is an appeal to Catholic officials in this country it must clearly be disregarded because it is inconsistent with the laws of the land. By issuing such an Appeal to Public Authorities the Pope has placed in a very difficult position those Catholics who occupy public positions in this or in any country where separation of church and state is constitutionally or otherwise basically guaranteed. They must choose for example when it comes to abortion for the therapeutic reason even of saving the life of the woman between their obligations to their church and their obligations to their state. This leads to the question whether as a matter of law Catholic doctors and Catholic hospitals which follow the teachings of the Pope are practicing sectarian medicine. If I am right that they are then they are infringing the American Medical Association s canons of ethics which prohibit the practice of sectarian medicine In order that a physician may best serve his patients he is expected to exalt the standards of his profession and to extend its sphere of usefulness. To the same end he should not base his practice on an exclusive dogma or a sectarian system for sects are implacable despots to accept their thralldom is to take away all liberty from one s action and thought. A sectarian or cultist as applied to medicine is one who alleges to follow or in his practice follows a dogma tenet or principle based on the authority of its promulgator to the exclusion of demonstration and scientific experience. Richard Cardinal Cushing said some time ago with reference to birth control Catholics do not need the support of civil law to be faithful to their own religious convictions and they do not seek to impose by law their moral views on other members of society. Perhaps it is because of their awareness of the impossible legal position the present stand of the Pope forces on Catholics who are lawmakers law interpreters or law enforcers that such leading Catholic legal scholars as Father Robert Drinan dean of Boston College Law School have called for total repeal rather than amendment of the abortion laws of all states. They claim that since to Catholics all abortions are unacceptable the state should keep hands off the subject rather than decreeing that some abortions are legal and some not. Catholics should of course be allowed to follow their own convictions in this area but so surely should the rest of us. To the extent also that doctor and hospital adherents to the Pope s Encyclical are the recipients of public funds they may be afoul of our First Amendment guarantees of religious freedom and antiestablishment of any church. And finally if for sectarian reasons they withhold a procedure which in any given situation would be regarded as the proper medical response to the problem presented they may be guilty of civil and criminal malpractice unless they at least explain to the patient their sectarian reasons for withholding the treatment so that the patient can go elsewhere if she chooses. It would seem that abortionlaw reform and better repeal is an idea whose time has come. It is more than time that it be supported by all those who want to slow down our population growth rate without resorting to coercion or compulsion. As SecretaryGeneral U Thant and many of the UN agencies have repeatedly said The opportunity to decide the number and spacing of children is a basic human right. Until such time as we have a perfect contraceptive universally available and invariably used voluntary abortion should be infinitely preferred to compulsory sterilization or compulsory birth control and that may well be the choice.

Access to safe legal abortion is a matter of human rights. Authoritative interpretations of international human rights law establish that denying women girls and other pregnant people access to abortion is a form of discrimination and jeopardizes a range of human rights. United Nations human rights treaty bodies regularly call for governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases and to ensure access to safe legal abortion in certain circumstances at a minimum. What are the human rights consequences of restricting or banning abortion access?  Countries have obligations to respect protect and fulfill human rights including those concerning sexual and reproductive health and autonomy. Where safe and legal abortion services are unreasonably restricted or not fully available many other internationally protected human rights may be at risk including rights to nondiscrimination and equality to life health and information to freedom from torture and cruel inhuman and degrading treatment to privacy and bodily autonomy and integrity to decide the number and spacing of children to liberty to enjoy the benefits of scientific progress and to freedom of conscience and religion. These rights are set out the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and protected in many international treaties including the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights ICESCR the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ICCPR the Convention Against Torture CAT the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women CEDAW and the Convention on the Rights of the Child CRC as well as in regional level treaties in Africa the Americas and Europe.  For nearly two decades Human Rights Watch has documented the human rights harm of restricted or banned access to abortion in countries around the world including in the US Ecuador Argentina Brazil the Dominican Republic and Ireland.  What is the Human Rights Watch position on abortion? Human Rights Watch believes that reproductive rights are human rights including the right to access to abortion. States have the obligation to provide women girls and other pregnant people with access to safe and legal abortion as part of their core human rights responsibilities. As Human Rights Watch has stated in amicus curiae briefs to high courts in countries around the world from Brazil and Colombia to South Korea and most recently with partner organizations in the United States international human rights law and relevant jurisprudence support the conclusion that decisions about abortion belong to a pregnant person alone without interference or unreasonable restriction by the state or third parties. Is the right to life at risk when access to abortion is restricted or banned? Yes. Legal restrictions on abortion often result in more illegal abortions which may also be unsafe and may drive higher maternal mortality and morbidity. As a result lack of access to safe and legal abortion puts the lives of pregnant people at risk. According to the World Health Organization WHO complications from pregnancy and childbirth are the leading cause of death for girls and young women ages 15 to 19 and children ages 10 to 14 have a higher risk of health complications and death from pregnancy than adults. WHO has also found that the removal of restrictions on abortion results in the reduction of maternal mortality. The UN Human Rights Committee HRC which monitors states compliance with the ICCPR has noted the relationship between restrictive abortion laws and threats to women s and girls lives. It has explicitly clarified that states parties cannot regulate access to abortion in any way that requires pregnant people to resort to unsafe abortions and that states must provide safe legal and effective access to abortion to prevent risk to the lives and health of pregnant people and to ensure that they are not subject to substantial pain or suffering most notably in cases where pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or the pregnancy is not viable. Do restrictive abortion policies reduce the rate of abortions? Abortion restrictions do not prevent abortions. Research has shown that when abortion is banned or restricted the number of abortions does not decrease. Abortions just move underground. This increases the risk both of unsafe procedures and that people will be reported to police or prosecuted for suspected abortions. The rate of unsafe abortions is nearly 45 times higher in countries with highly restrictive abortion laws than in countries where abortion is legal and unrestricted. Restrictive abortion policies push pregnant people seeking abortions especially those living in poverty or rural areas out of the healthcare system and into unsafe unregulated settings. WHO has also stated that lack of access to safe affordable timely and respectful abortion care as well as the promotion of stigma associated with abortion poses risks to abortion seekers physical and mental wellbeing throughout their lives. Who will be most harmed from restrictions on access to abortion?  Not all pregnant people are likely to experience the human rights and health harm of restricting abortion equally. Young people and marginalized groups including Black Indigenous and other people of color people living in economic poverty and sexual and gender minorities are more likely to be harmed. The UN Human Rights Committee has held that lack of availability of reproductive health information and services including abortion undermines women s right to nondiscrimination. The UN Human Rights Committee like the Committee on the Elimination on Discrimination Against Women has also noted that restrictions on abortion result in the disproportionate practice of illegal unsafe abortions by poor and rural women or women unable to travel outside a jurisdiction where abortion is banned. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also said that punitive abortion laws constitute a violation of children s right to freedom from discrimination. Even where abortion is technically legal heavy restrictions can make it inaccessible to marginalized people. This forces pregnant people particularly from marginalized groups to look for unsafe and clandestine abortion opportunities and to risk criminal or civil penalties even when their circumstances fall within what is legally permissible. Moreover the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights has said a wide range of laws policies and practices undermine the autonomy and right to equality and nondiscrimination in the full enjoyment of the right to sexual and reproductive health for example criminalization of abortion or restrictive abortion laws. It has also noted that restrictions on abortion particularly affect women living in poverty or without or with less formal education. Similarly six UN experts stressed in a 2015 joint news release that in El Salvador the total ban on abortion disproportionately affects women who are poor.  What has the UN said about lack of access to and criminalization of abortion? UN human rights treaty bodies which monitor countries compliance with relevant treaties and that report or advise on human rights related to specific themes or countries have consistently called for decriminalization of abortion and the full realization of sexual and reproductive rights including access to safe legal abortion. Examples of statements from these mechanisms in relation to abortion include the following The CEDAW Committee which monitors compliance with CEDAW stated that Unsafe abortion is a leading cause of maternal mortality and morbidity. As such States parties should legalize abortion at least in cases of rape incest threats to the life andor health of the mother or severe fetal impairment as well as provide women with access to quality postabortion care especially in cases of complications resulting from unsafe abortions. States parties should also remove punitive measures for women who undergo abortion. The committee has made similar recommendations to many governments while reviewing their compliance with the treaty. These recommendations typically call on governments to decriminalize abortion in all cases legalize abortion in the circumstances noted above and guarantee access. The Human Rights Committee which monitors states compliance with the ICCPR has noted the relationship between restrictive abortion laws and threats to women s and girls lives and has clarified the scope of States parties obligations to protect their right to life. In particular restrictions on the ability of women or girls to seek abortion must not inter alia jeopardize their lives. The committee has frequently expressed concern about criminalization of abortion and has called for expanded access. Like the CEDAW Committee the Human Rights Committee the Committee on Economic Social and Cultural Rights which monitors the ICESCR and the Committee against Torture which monitors CAT have called the removal of penalties for abortion and for the implementation of measures to ensure safe legal access to abortion. Where safe abortion is not available it can pose risks to mental health including severe anguish and risk of suicide. The tie between mental health and restrictions in access to reproductive health is so clear that the UN Committee against Torture has expressed concern at the severe physical and mental anguish and distress experienced by women and girls due to abortion restrictions and concluded that criminalization and inaccessibility of abortion can be incompatible with a government s duty to uphold the right to freedom from torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Similarly the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has urged states to decriminalize abortion to ensure that girls have access to safe abortion and postabortion services review legislation with a view to guaranteeing the best interests of pregnant adolescents and ensure that their views are always heard and respected in abortionrelated decisions. In many individual state reviews of treaty compliance called concluding observations the committee explicitly called for decriminalization of abortion in all circumstances.  The UN special rapporteur on the right to health has said that criminal laws penalizing and restricting induced abortion are impermissible barriers to the realization of women s right to health and must be eliminated.

https://apnorc.org/projects/most-americans-support-legal-abortion-with-some-restrictions-ap-norc/, A year after Roe v. Wade was overturned most adults still believe that abortion should be legal and most are in favor of Congress guaranteeing access to legal abortion. A year after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade most adults still believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases and most are in favor of Congress passing a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion. This is similar to the results of an APNORC poll conducted July 2022 when Roe v. Wade was first overturned. Opinions are more divided over the timeframe of when abortion should be allowed. Seventythree percent of respondents think that it should be allowed within the first 6 weeks but that drops to 51 for 15 weeks. Most people living in states where abortion is highly restricted say it should be legal at least up to six weeks even as they generally favor tighter access to abortion than adults overall.  Most adults believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases consistent with a July 2022 poll. And 60 of the public think Congress should pass a law guaranteeing access to legal abortion nationwide. However a partisan divide persists. Most Democrats say abortion should be legal in all or most cases while most Republicans think it should be illegal in most or all cases. Similarly 84 of Democrats support a federal law ensuring access to the procedure compared to just 32 of Republicans. Democrats are more supportive of legal abortion than Republicans regardless of religion. Among Catholics 85 of Democrats believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared to 39 of Republicans. People living in states with the most restrictive abortion laws are less likely than those living in states where abortion is broadly available to say abortion should usually be legal 53 vs 70. Still even in those most restrictive states only 14 say abortion should always be illegal.  And while most people believe that their state should allow legal abortion 6 weeks into pregnancy opinions are more divided later into pregnancy. About half of adults say states should allow legal abortions at 15 weeks and just 27 say the same at 24 weeks into a pregnancy. Fiftyeight percent of those living in states with the most restrictive abortion laws people say abortion should be allowed at six weeks along with more than 7 in 10 people in the rest of the country. At 15 weeks 59 of those living in the least restrictive states say it should be legal compared with about 4 in 10 people in more restrictive states. Only 31 of people living in states where abortion is broadly available say the procedure should be legal at 24 weeks as well as about one in four residents of states with at least some restrictions.  Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans believe that a pregnant person should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion in certain circumstances including if the child would be born with a lifethreatening illness the pregnant person s own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy or the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. And majorities of bornagain Christians and Catholics agree that a pregnant person should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion if the pregnant person s own health is seriously endangered by the pregnancy or if the person became pregnant as the result of rape or incest. But if a person does not want to be pregnant for any reason just 29 of Republicans believe they should be allowed to obtain a legal abortion compared to 79 Democrats. These opinions have remained relatively consistent since APNORC last asked these questions in July 2022. Most adults know someone who has had an abortion including 63 of Democrats and 53 of Republicans. Despite the overturning of Roe v. Wade few Americans know someone who has been unable to get an abortion 7 or who had to travel to another state to do so 7 in the last year. The public is divided about how easy it is to access abortion in their community. Thirtynine percent think it is too difficult 24 think it is too easy and 32 think it is about right. About half of adults say access is about right when it comes to family planning services and birth control and prenatal care while 28 say it is too difficult to access these services. People living in states with highly restrictive abortion policies are somewhat more likely to say it s too difficult than people in states where abortion is broadly available 44 to 36 even though people in these states generally favor more restrictions on abortion. Overall 39 of adults approve of how President Biden is handling abortion policy including 61 of Democrats and just 18 of Republicans. States where most abortions are illegal at all stages of pregnancy with few exceptions include Alabama Arkansas Idaho Kentucky Louisiana Mississippi Missouri North Dakota Oklahoma South Dakota Tennessee Texas West Virginia and Wisconsin. Abortion is illegal after about six to 20 weeks of pregnancy in Arizona Florida Georgia Nebraska North Carolina South Carolina and Utah.  And states where abortion is legal at least until 22 weeks include Alaska California Colorado Connecticut Delaware District of Columbia Hawaii Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Montana Nevada New Hampshire New Jersey New Mexico New York Ohio Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia Washington and Wyoming. The nationwide poll was conducted June 2226 2023 using the AmeriSpeak Panel the probabilitybased panel of NORC at the University of Chicago. Online and telephone interviews using landlines and cell phones were conducted with 1220 adults. The margin of sampling error is 3.9 percentage points.
https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2022/05/06/americans-views-on-whether-and-in-what-circumstances-abortion-should-be-legal/, As the longrunning debate over abortion reaches another key moment at the Supreme Court and in state legislatures across the country a majority of U.S. adults continue to say that abortion should be legal in all or most cases. About sixinten Americans 61 say abortion should be legal in all or most cases while 37 think abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. These views have changed little over the past several years In 2019 for example 61 of adults said abortion should be legal in all or most cases while 38 said it should be illegal in all or most cases. Most respondents in the new survey took one of the middle options when first asked about their views on abortion saying either that abortion should be legal in most cases 36 or illegal in most cases 27.  Respondents who said abortion should either be legal in all cases or illegal in all cases received a followup question asking whether there should be any exceptions to such laws. Overall 25 of adults initially said abortion should be legal in all cases but about a quarter of this group 6 of all U.S. adults went on to say that there should be some exceptions when abortion should be against the law. Oneinten adults initially answered that abortion should be illegal in all cases but about oneinfive of these respondents 2 of all U.S. adults followed up by saying that there are some exceptions when abortion should be permitted.  Altogether seveninten Americans say abortion should be legal in some cases and illegal in others including 42 who say abortion should be generally legal but with some exceptions and 29 who say it should be generally illegal except in certain cases. Much smaller shares take absolutist views when it comes to the legality of abortion in the U.S. maintaining that abortion should be legal in all cases with no exceptions 19 or illegal in all circumstances 8.  There is a modest gender gap in views of whether abortion should be legal with women slightly more likely than men to say abortion should be legal in all cases or in all cases but with some exceptions 63 vs. 58.  Younger adults are considerably more likely than older adults to say abortion should be legal Threequarters of adults under 30 74 say abortion should be generally legal including 30 who say it should be legal in all cases without exception.  But there is an even larger gap in views toward abortion by partisanship 80 of Democrats and Democraticleaning independents say abortion should be legal in all or most cases compared with 38 of Republicans and GOP leaners. Previous Center research has shown this gap widening over the past 15 years.  Still while partisans diverge in views of whether abortion should mostly be legal or illegal most Democrats and Republicans do not view abortion in absolutist terms. Just 13 of Republicans say abortion should be against the law in all cases without exception 47 say it should be illegal with some exceptions. And while threeinten Democrats say abortion should be permitted in all circumstances half say it should mostly be legal but with some exceptions.  There also are sizable divisions within both partisan coalitions by ideology. For instance while a majority of moderate and liberal Republicans say abortion should mostly be legal 60 just 27 of conservative Republicans say the same. Among Democrats selfdescribed liberals are twice as apt as moderates and conservatives to say abortion should be legal in all cases without exception 42 vs. 20. Regardless of partisan affiliation adults who say they personally know someone who has had an abortion such as a friend relative or themselves are more likely to say abortion should be legal than those who say they do not know anyone who had an abortion. Views toward abortion also vary considerably by religious affiliation specifically among large Christian subgroups and religiously unaffiliated Americans.  For example roughly threequarters of White evangelical Protestants say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases. This is far higher than the share of White nonevangelical Protestants 38 or Black Protestants 28 who say the same.  Despite Catholic teaching on abortion a slim majority of U.S. Catholics 56 say abortion should be legal. This includes 13 who say it should be legal in all cases without exception and 43 who say it should be legal but with some exceptions.  Compared with Christians religiously unaffiliated adults are far more likely to say abortion should be legal overall and significantly more inclined to say it should be legal in all cases without exception. Within this group atheists stand out 97 say abortion should be legal including 53 who say it should be legal in all cases without exception. Agnostics and those who describe their religion as nothing in particular also overwhelmingly say that abortion should be legal but they are more likely than atheists to say there are some circumstances when abortion should be against the law. Although the survey was conducted among Americans of many religious backgrounds including Jews Muslims Buddhists and Hindus it did not obtain enough respondents from nonChristian groups to report separately on their responses. As a growing number of states debate legislation to restrict abortion often after a certain stage of pregnancy Americans express complex views about when abortion should generally be legal and when it should be against the law. Overall a majority of adults 56 say that how long a woman has been pregnant should matter in determining when abortion should be legal while far fewer 14 say that this should not be a factor. An additional onequarter of the public says that abortion should either be legal 19 or illegal 8 in all circumstances without exception these respondents did not receive this question. Among men and women Republicans and Democrats and Christians and religious nones who do not take absolutist positions about abortion on either side of the debate the prevailing view is that the stage of the pregnancy should be a factor in determining whether abortion should be legal. Americans broadly are more likely to favor restrictions on abortion later in pregnancy than earlier in pregnancy. Many adults also say the legality of abortion depends on other factors at every stage of pregnancy.  Overall a plurality of adults 44 say that abortion should be legal six weeks into a pregnancy which is about when cardiac activity sometimes called a fetal heartbeat may be detected and before many women know they are pregnant this includes 19 of adults who say abortion should be legal in all cases without exception as well as 25 of adults who say it should be legal at that point in a pregnancy. An additional 7 say abortion generally should be legal in most cases but that the stage of the pregnancy should not matter in determining legality.1 Oneinfive Americans 21 say abortion should be illegal at six weeks. This includes 8 of adults who say abortion should be illegal in all cases without exception as well as 12 of adults who say that abortion should be illegal at this point. Additionally 6 say abortion should be illegal in most cases and how long a woman has been pregnant should not matter in determining abortion s legality. Nearly oneinfive respondents when asked whether abortion should be legal six weeks into a pregnancy say it depends.  Americans are more divided about what should be permitted 14 weeks into a pregnancy roughly at the end of the first trimester although still more people say abortion should be legal at this stage 34 than illegal 27 and about oneinfive say it depends.  Fewer adults say abortion should be legal 24 weeks into a pregnancy about when a healthy fetus could survive outside the womb with medical care. At this stage 22 of adults say abortion should be legal while nearly twice as many 43 say it should be illegal. Again about oneinfive adults 18 say whether abortion should be legal at 24 weeks depends on other factors.  Respondents who said that abortion should be illegal 24 weeks into a pregnancy or that it depends were asked a followup question about whether abortion at that point should be legal if the pregnant woman s life is in danger or the baby would be born with severe disabilities. Most who received this question say abortion in these circumstances should be legal 54 or that it depends on other factors 40. Just 4 of this group maintained that abortion should be illegal in this case. This pattern in views of abortion whereby more favor greater restrictions on abortion as a pregnancy progresses is evident across a variety of demographic and political groups.  Democrats are far more likely than Republicans to say that abortion should be legal at each of the three stages of pregnancy asked about on the survey. For example while 26 of Republicans say abortion should be legal at six weeks of pregnancy more than twice as many Democrats say the same 61. Similarly while about a third of Democrats say abortion should be legal at 24 weeks of pregnancy just 8 of Republicans say the same.  However neither Republicans nor Democrats uniformly express absolutist views about abortion throughout a pregnancy. Republicans are divided on abortion at six weeks Roughly a quarter say it should be legal 26 while a similar share say it depends 24. A third say it should be illegal.  Democrats are divided about whether abortion should be legal or illegal at 24 weeks with 34 saying it should be legal 29 saying it should be illegal and 21 saying it depends.  There also is considerable division among each partisan group by ideology. At six weeks of pregnancy just oneinfive conservative Republicans 19 say that abortion should be legal moderate and liberal Republicans are twice as likely as their conservative counterparts to say this 39.  At the same time about half of liberal Democrats 48 say abortion at 24 weeks should be legal while 17 say it should be illegal. Among conservative and moderate Democrats the pattern is reversed A plurality 39 say abortion at this stage should be illegal while 24 say it should be legal.  Christian adults are far less likely than religiously unaffiliated Americans to say abortion should be legal at each stage of pregnancy.  Among Protestants White evangelicals stand out for their opposition to abortion. At six weeks of pregnancy for example 44 say abortion should be illegal compared with 17 of White nonevangelical Protestants and 15 of Black Protestants. This pattern also is evident at 14 and 24 weeks of pregnancy when half or more of White evangelicals say abortion should be illegal. At six weeks a plurality of Catholics 41 say abortion should be legal while smaller shares say it depends or it should be illegal. But by 24 weeks about half of Catholics 49 say abortion should be illegal.  Among adults who are religiously unaffiliated atheists stand out for their views. They are the only group in which a sizable majority says abortion should be legal at each point in a pregnancy. Even at 24 weeks 62 of selfdescribed atheists say abortion should be legal compared with smaller shares of agnostics 43 and those who say their religion is nothing in particular 31.  As is the case with adults overall most religiously affiliated and religiously unaffiliated adults who originally say that abortion should be illegal or it depends at 24 weeks go on to say either it should be legal or it depends if the pregnant woman s life is in danger or the baby would be born with severe disabilities. Few 4 and 5 respectively say abortion should be illegal at 24 weeks in these situations. The stage of the pregnancy is not the only factor that shapes people s views of when abortion should be legal. Sizable majorities of U.S. adults say that abortion should be legal if the pregnancy threatens the life or health of the pregnant woman 73 or if pregnancy is the result of rape 69.  There is less consensus when it comes to circumstances in which a baby may be born with severe disabilities or health problems 53 of Americans overall say abortion should be legal in such circumstances including 19 who say abortion should be legal in all cases and 35 who say there are some situations where abortions should be illegal but that it should be legal in this specific type of case. A quarter of adults say it depends in this situation and about oneinfive say it should be illegal 10 who say illegal in this specific circumstance and 8 who say illegal in all circumstances.  There are sizable divides between and among partisans when it comes to views of abortion in these situations. Overall Republicans are less likely than Democrats to say abortion should be legal in each of the three circumstances outlined in the survey. However both partisan groups are less likely to say abortion should be legal when the baby may be born with severe disabilities or health problems than when the woman s life is in danger or the pregnancy is the result of rape.  Just as there are wide gaps among Republicans by ideology on whether how long a woman has been pregnant should be a factor in determining abortion s legality there are large gaps when it comes to circumstances in which abortions should be legal. For example while a clear majority of moderate and liberal Republicans 71 say abortion should be permitted when the pregnancy is the result of rape conservative Republicans are more divided. About half 48 say it should be legal in this situation while 29 say it should be illegal and 21 say it depends. The ideological gaps among Democrats are slightly less pronounced. Most Democrats say abortion should be legal in each of the three circumstances just to varying degrees. While 77 of liberal Democrats say abortion should be legal if a baby will be born with severe disabilities or health problems for example a smaller majority of conservative and moderate Democrats 60 say the same.  White evangelical Protestants again stand out for their views on abortion in various circumstances they are far less likely than White nonevangelical or Black Protestants to say abortion should be legal across each of the three circumstances described in the survey.  While about half of White evangelical Protestants 51 say abortion should be legal if a pregnancy threatens the woman s life or health clear majorities of other Protestant groups and Catholics say this should be the case. The same pattern holds in views of whether abortion should be legal if the pregnancy is the result of rape. Most White nonevangelical Protestants 75 Black Protestants 71 and Catholics 66 say abortion should be permitted in this instance while White evangelicals are more divided 40 say it should be legal while 34 say it should be illegal and about a quarter say it depends.  Mirroring the pattern seen among adults overall opinions are more varied about a situation where a baby might be born with severe disabilities or health issues. For instance half of Catholics say abortion should be legal in such cases while 21 say it should be illegal and 27 say it depends on the situation.  Most religiously unaffiliated adults including overwhelming majorities of selfdescribed atheists say abortion should be legal in each of the three circumstances.  Seveninten U.S. adults say that doctors or other health care providers should be required to notify a parent or legal guardian if the pregnant woman seeking an abortion is under 18 while 28 say they should not be required to do so.  Women are slightly less likely than men to say this should be a requirement 67 vs. 74. And younger adults are far less likely than those who are older to say a parent or guardian should be notified before a doctor performs an abortion on a pregnant woman who is under 18. In fact about half of adults ages 18 to 24 53 say a doctor should not be required to notify a parent. By contrast 64 of adults ages 25 to 29 say doctors should be required to notify parents of minors seeking an abortion as do 68 of adults ages 30 to 49 and 78 of those 50 and older.  A large majority of Republicans 85 say that a doctor should be required to notify the parents of a minor before an abortion though conservative Republicans are somewhat more likely than moderate and liberal Republicans to take this position 90 vs. 77.  The ideological divide is even more pronounced among Democrats. Overall a slim majority of Democrats 57 say a parent should be notified in this circumstance but while 72 of conservative and moderate Democrats hold this view just 39 of liberal Democrats agree.  By and large most Protestant 81 and Catholic 78 adults say doctors should be required to notify parents of minors before an abortion. But religiously unaffiliated Americans are more divided. Majorities of both atheists 71 and agnostics 58 say doctors should not be required to notify parents of minors seeking an abortion while sixinten of those who describe their religion as nothing in particular say such notification should be required.  Americans are divided over who should be penalized and what that penalty should be in a situation where an abortion occurs illegally.  Overall a 60 majority of adults say that if a doctor or provider performs an abortion in a situation where it is illegal they should face a penalty. But there is less agreement when it comes to others who may have been involved in the procedure.  While about half of the public 47 says a woman who has an illegal abortion should face a penalty a nearly identical share 50 says she should not. And adults are more likely to say people who help find and schedule or pay for an abortion in a situation where it is illegal should not face a penalty than they are to say they should. Views about penalties are closely correlated with overall attitudes about whether abortion should be legal or illegal. For example just 20 of adults who say abortion should be legal in all cases without exception think doctors or providers should face a penalty if an abortion were carried out in a situation where it was illegal. This compares with 91 of those who think abortion should be illegal in all cases without exceptions. Still regardless of how they feel about whether abortion should be legal or not Americans are more likely to say a doctor or provider should face a penalty compared with others involved in the procedure.  Among those who say medical providers andor women should face penalties for illegal abortions there is no consensus about whether they should get jail time or a less severe punishment. Among U.S. adults overall 14 say women should serve jail time if they have an abortion in a situation where it is illegal while 16 say they should receive a fine or community service and 17 say they are not sure what the penalty should be.  A somewhat larger share of Americans 25 say doctors or other medical providers should face jail time for providing illegal abortion services while 18 say they should face fines or community service and 17 are not sure. About threeinten U.S. adults 31 say doctors should lose their medical license if they perform an abortion in a situation where it is illegal. Men are more likely than women to favor penalties for the woman or doctor in situations where abortion is illegal. About half of men 52 say women should face a penalty while just 43 of women say the same. Similarly about twothirds of men 64 say a doctor should face a penalty while 56 of women agree. Republicans are considerably more likely than Democrats to say both women and doctors should face penalties including jail time. For example 21 of Republicans say the woman who had the abortion should face jail time and 40 say this about the doctor who performed the abortion. Among Democrats far smaller shares say the woman 8 or doctor 13 should serve jail time.  White evangelical Protestants are more likely than other Protestant groups to favor penalties for abortions in situations where they are illegal. Fully 24 say the woman who had the abortion should serve time in jail compared with just 12 of White nonevangelical Protestants or Black Protestants. And while about half of White evangelicals 48 say doctors who perform illegal abortions should serve jail time just 26 of White nonevangelical Protestants and 18 of Black Protestants share this view.

PIP The abolition of legal abortion in the US would seriously threaten the health and even the lives of women and children. Statistics on the relationship between abortion and health attained before and after abortion was legalized were used to project some of the probable consequences of reversing the US Supreme Courts 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Abortion has been widely practiced throughout US history but the actual number of procedures performed before some states legalized abortion is unknown. Few legal procedures were performed for medical reasons yet many illegal abortions took place. In 1955 a panel of experts could only provide a best estimate of between 200000 and 1200000 illegally induced abortions occurring annually in the US. The actual number was most likely closer to the higher figure. The complication rates for illegal abortions most of which were performed by unskilled practitioners in unsafe settings were much higher than the rates for legal abortion now. Complications were related to ineffective or unsafe methods Sepsis particularly with the bacterium Clostridium prefringens which causes gas gangrene was a major problem that has virtually disappeared. Each year prior to the 1970s more than 100 women in the US died of abortion complications. Due to the fact that vital statistics reflect an incomplete ascertainment of deaths the actual number of deaths is probably larger possibly by as much as 50. In 1983 more than 1.3 million procedures were performed a figure close to the estimated number of illegal abortions performed before 1970. In comparison 672000 hysterectomies and 424000 tonsillectomy operations were performed the same year. The number of abortionrelated deaths in the US decreased between 1972 and 1980 from 90 to 16. Most of this decrease resulted from the availability and safety of legal abortion. Legal abortion carries an especially low risk of death particularly when performed in the 1st trimester. For the 197280 period the risk of death was 1.91000000 abortion procedures. Legal abortion also has a lower risk of death than does childbearing. Using even conservative data the comparison of mortality rates reveals that terminating a pregnancy through legally induced abortion is 7 times safter than carrying the pregnancy to term. Legal abortion also results in low morbidity rates. As legal abortions became widely available the numbers of women treated for septic abortion complications in emergency rooms and hospitals decreased markedly. If abortions were again made illegal the number of illegal abortions in the US would probably increase from fewer than 20000 at present to more than 1000000 per year. Because illegal abortion may carry a risk of death as much as 30 times that of legal abortion deaths to women of reproductive age in the US would be expected to increase.
