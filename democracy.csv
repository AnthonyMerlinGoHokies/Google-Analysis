https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy/England, Among the assemblies created in Europe during the Middle Ages the one that most profoundly influenced the development of representative government was the English Parliament. Less a product of design than an unintended consequence of opportunistic innovations Parliament grew out of councils that were called by kings for the purpose of redressing grievances and for exercising judicial functions. In time Parliament began to deal with important matters of state notably the raising of revenues needed to support the policies and decisions of the monarch. As its judicial functions were increasingly delegated to courts it gradually evolved into a legislative body. By the end of the 15th century the English system displayed some of the basic features of modern parliamentary government for example the enactment of laws now required the passage of bills by both houses of Parliament and the formal approval of the monarch. Other important features had yet to be established however. England s political life was dominated by the monarchy for centuries after the Middle Ages. During the English Civil Wars led on one side by radical Puritans the monarchy was abolished and a republic the Commonwealth was established 1649 though the monarchy was restored in 1660. By about 1800 significant powers notably including powers related to the appointment and tenure of the prime minister had shifted to Parliament. This development was strongly influenced by the emergence of political factions in Parliament during the early years of the 18th century. These factions known as Whigs and Tories later became fullfledged parties. To king and Parliament alike it became increasingly apparent that laws could not be passed nor taxes raised without the support of a Whig or Tory leader who could muster a majority of votes in the House of Commons. To gain that support the monarch was forced to select as prime minister the leader of the majority party in the Commons and to accept the leader s suggestions for the composition of the cabinet. That the monarch should have to yield to Parliament in this area became manifest during a constitutional crisis in 1782 when King George III reigned 1760 1820 was compelled much against his will to accept a Whig prime minister and cabinet a situation he regarded according to one scholar as a violation of the Constitution a defeat for his policy and a personal humiliation. By 1830 the constitutional principle that the choice of prime minister and thus the cabinet reposed with the House of Commons had become firmly entrenched in the unwritten British Constitution. Parliamentary government in Britain was not yet a democratic system however. Mainly because of property requirements the franchise was held by only about 5 percent of the British population over 20 years of age. The Reform Act of 1832 which is generally viewed as a historic threshold in the development of parliamentary democracy in Britain extended the suffrage to about 7 percent of the adult population see Reform Bill. It would require further acts of Parliament in 1867 1884 and 1918 to achieve universal male suffrage and one more law enacted in 1928 to secure the right to vote for all women. Whereas the feasibility of representative government was demonstrated by the development of Parliament the possibility of joining representation with democracy first became fully evident in the governments of the British colonies of North America and later in the founding of the United States of America. Conditions in colonial America favoured the limited development of a system of representation more broadly based than the one in use in Great Britain. These conditions included the vast distance from London which forced the British government to grant significant autonomy to the colonies the existence of colonial legislatures in which representatives in at least one house were elected by voters the expansion of the suffrage which in some colonies came to include most adult white males the spread of property ownership particularly in land and the strengthening of beliefs in fundamental rights and popular sovereignty including the belief that the colonists as British citizens should not have to pay taxes to a government in which they were not represented no taxation without representation . Until about 1760 most colonists were loyal to the mother country and did not think of themselves as constituting a separate nation of Americans. After Britain imposed direct taxation on the colonies through the Stamp Act 1765 however there were public and sometimes violent displays of opposition to the new law. In colonial newspapers there was also a sharp increase in the use of the term Americans to refer to the colonial population. Other factors that helped to create a distinct American identity were the outbreak of war with Britain in 1775 and the shared hardships and suffering of the people during many years of fighting the adoption of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 the flight of many loyalists to Canada and England and the rapid increase in travel and communication between the newly independent states. The colonists sense of themselves as a single people fragile as it may have been made possible the creation of a loose confederacy of states under the Articles of Confederation in 1781 89 and an even more unified federal government under the Constitution in 1789. Because of the new country s large population and enormous size it was obvious to the delegates to the Constitutional Convention 1787 that the People of the United States as the opening words of the Constitution referred to them could govern themselves at the federal level only by electing representatives a practice with which the delegates were already familiar given their experience of state government and more remotely their dealings with the government in Britain. The new representative government was barely in place however when it became evident that the task of organizing members of Congress and the electorate required the existence of political parties even though such parties had been regarded as pernicious and destructive the bane of republics by political thinkers and by many delegates to the Constitutional Convention. Eventually political parties in the United States would provide nominees for local state and national offices and compete openly and vigorously in elections see below Factions and parties. It was also obvious that a country as large as the United States would require representative government at lower levels e.g. territories states and municipalities with correspondingly limited powers. Although the governments of territories and states were necessarily representative in smaller associations a direct assembly of citizens was both feasible and desirable. In many New England towns for example citizens assembled in meetings Athenian style to discuss and vote on local matters. Thus the citizens of the United States helped to provide new answers to question 1 What is the appropriate unit or association within which a democratic government should be established? and question 3 How are citizens to govern? Yet the American answer to question 2 Who should constitute the d mos? though radical in its time was by later standards highly unsatisfactory. Even as the suffrage was broadly extended among adult white males it continued to exclude large segments of the adult population such as women slaves many freed Blacks and Native Americans. In time these exclusions like those of earlier democracies and republics would be widely regarded as undemocratic.,
https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy/The-value-of-democracy, Why should the people rule? Is democracy really superior to any other form of government? Although a full exploration of this issue is beyond the scope of this article see political philosophy history particularly 20thcentury history demonstrates that democracy uniquely possesses a number of features that most people whatever their basic political beliefs would consider desirable 1 democracy helps to prevent rule by cruel and vicious autocrats 2 modern representative democracies do not fight wars with one another 3 countries with democratic governments tend to be more prosperous than countries with nondemocratic governments and 4 democracy tends to foster human development as measured by health education personal income and other indicators more fully than other forms of government do. Other features of democracy also would be considered desirable by most people though some would regard them as less important than features 1 through 4 above 5 democracy helps people to protect their fundamental interests 6 democracy guarantees its citizens fundamental rights that nondemocratic systems do not and cannot grant and 7 democracy ensures its citizens a broader range of personal freedoms than other forms of government do. Finally there are some features of democracy that some people the critics of democracy would not consider desirable at all though most people upon reflection would regard them as at least worthwhile 8 only democracy provides people with a maximum opportunity to live under laws of their own choosing 9 only democracy provides people with a maximum opportunity to take moral responsibility for their choices and decisions about government policies and 10 only in a democracy can there be a relatively high level of political equality. These advantages notwithstanding there have been critics of democracy since ancient times. Perhaps the most enduring of their charges is that most people are incapable of participating in government in a meaningful or competent way because they lack the necessary knowledge intelligence wisdom experience or character. Thus Plato as noted above argued that the best government would be an aristocracy of philosopherkings whose rigorous intellectual and moral training would make them uniquely qualified to rule. The view that the people as a whole are incapable of governing themselves has been espoused not only by kings and aristocratic rulers but also by political theorists Plato foremost among them religious leaders and other authorities. The view was prevalent in one form or another throughout the world during most of recorded history until the early 20th century and since then it has been most often invoked by opponents of democracy in Europe and elsewhere to justify various forms of dictatorship and oneparty rule. No doubt there will be critics of democracy for as long as democratic governments exist. The extent of their success in winning adherents and promoting the creation of nondemocratic regimes will depend on how well democratic governments meet the new challenges and crises that are all but certain to occur. Democracies face growing challenges in the 21st century. There are new and serious obstacles to their stability and the diminished performance of many democratic governments in providing encompassing economic security has bred skepticism of the value of democracy among their citizens. As democratic governments have failed to meet their citizens political and economic demands disaffection has increased. This alienation is reflected in declining voter turnout opinion polls showing reduced commitment to democratic institutions increased admiration for autocratic leaders and growing vote shares for extremist candidates and parties proposing antidemocratic alternatives. Rising disaffection with democracy has also gone hand in hand with increasing support for exclusionary ethnic politics. Democracy works best when governments have incentives to pursue broadly encompassing policies that benefit the citizenry as a whole. This is most likely when political competition is robust and governments can legislate effectively. Diminishing competition between parties and political fragmentation which tends to increase with the number of parties in a national legislature are therefore bad for democracy. A group of legislators will find it easiest to make a collective decision if all of its members have similar preferences. If their preferences differ they can still manage their disagreements tolerably through negotiation compromise and sometimes logrolling the trading of votes by legislators to secure favourable action on projects of interest to each so long as none has preferences that are abhorrent to others. Fragmented governments find it harder to enact policies that benefit most people because they often depend on the support of voters with widely divergent preferences. This in turn reinforces the perception that one group s gain is another s loss. The problem fragmentation poses for democracy is particularly acute when there is substantial political polarization because under such circumstances some people are never willing to accommodate the preferences of others. A majority can outvote a minority in a democracy but democracies are healthiest when the defeated minority can plausibly look forward to winning elections in the future. Otherwise the minority will be encouraged to withdraw from democratic competition and pursue antidemocratic alternatives. This is one reason why polarization threatens democracy. Democracy discourages extremism when it generates centripetal tendencies and encourages competition but extremism threatens democracy by increasing the costs of regularly alternating governments and removing incentives to wait one s turn. Those whose preferences will never be satisfied through democratic channels have incentives to pursue their interests through violence if they think they can get away with it. Rising extremism undermines democracy in another way. Democracy counts on the loyal opposition for accountability. When the opposition is not credible because it is either sufficiently undesirable or widely perceived to be so undesirable as not to be likely to win power there is no electoral check on the incumbent and accountability suffers. The following sections examine the leading contemporary threats to the performance and durability of democratic systems centring on the sources of the dynamics just described. The discussion here focuses on trends that are secular and crossnational for the most part setting aside idiosyncratic features of particular systems in order to diagnose the predicaments of developed democracies generally. Some of the major obstacles to democratic performance and hence to democratic stability are structural making them particularly difficult to resolve but also particularly worth understanding. The survival of democratic regimes hinges above all on citizens economic wellbeing. Democracies endure when they deliver the goods. Historically democracies have always survived as long as citizens yearly per capita income has remained above about 16750 as measured in 2022 U.S. dollars. Democratic breakdown becomes a concern when per capita income falls below this threshold and it becomes increasingly likely the farther per capita income falls. There have been exceptions to this generalization notably India but democracy does not usually fare well in poor countries. Economic inequality also matters though democracy has sometimes endured along with high and even increasing levels of inequality as in countries like South Africa and Brazil. The direction of change seems to matter more than absolute levels of inequality. Historically revolutions and coups have been associated with defeated expectations of rising prosperity. Democracy becomes even more vulnerable when living standards actually fall as they did in Italy and Germany in the 1920s and 30s and in Egypt before the military coup in that country in 2013 so that large numbers of people suffer unexpected losses of economic security and social status. Democracy also does better in broadly diversified economies than in economies that depend on a small number of natural resources. Thus the oil curse affects democracy s durability because government leaders who control access to such a lucrative economic sector will be less willing to surrender their authority if there are few alternative sources of income. The older democracies of the OECD Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development today face unprecedented economic challenges that threaten democratic stability. The steady decline of manufacturing jobs in these countries since the mid20th century has resulted in a shift toward service economies and the growth of the whitecollar sector. Trade union membership has declined in almost all developed countries in many cases significantly. Lifetime employment which was widespread in older democracies a generation ago has been replaced by a world in which most adults must expect to change jobs multiple times during their working careers often to lowerstatus positions with fewer or no employment benefits. Family or household incomes have barely kept pace with inflation despite the fact that women have entered the labour market in large numbers with the result that singleearner households have largely been replaced by twoearner households. Relative inequalities between those in the top decile and the rest have grown relentlessly. Leftofcentre parties have become smaller and weaker as a result of these developments. They have failed to adequately respond to declining industrial employment enacting policies that protect the interests of a diminishing cadre of workers more than they do the interests of those who have been left behind by deindustrialization even as precarious employment has proliferated with the rise of independent contractors and zerohours contracts i.e. employment contracts that do not guarantee a minimum number of working hours for employees. This in turn has led social democratic parties to hemorrhage support often to populist parties and politicians who promise quick fixes like immigration bans and trade wars which produce further disenchantment when they fail to improve conditions. Mainstream parties have fragmented which makes governing more difficult and compounds the problem of precarity and its political consequences. As well as changing economic circumstances that sap political support for mainstream political parties demographic changes have compounded fiscal stress in the older democracies. In most OECD countries retired populations are growing and working populations are shrinking as people are living longer than ever before. These developments increase demand for tax revenues to support pension and health care expenses for the elderly at the same time as tax bases shrink diminishing government revenues. Exacerbating this fiscal stress the collapse of communism and the advent of an integrated global economy since the 1990s have meant that capital particularly financial capital is more mobile than ever before. The perpetual threat of capital flight keeps pressure on governments to limit tax increases. The mobility of capital creates another political obstacle to taxation the political influence of the wealthy. The wealthy by means of their greater financial resources have disproportionate power to influence the political process through various channels both licit and illicit. They can make substantial financial contributions to political campaigns. They can finance litigation and engage in advocacy before administrative agencies. They can invest in political advertising think tanks and even media organizations shaping how issues of interest to the public are framed and influencing what issues become part of the political agendas of governments and political parties. Although citizens tend to be more exercised by insecurity than inequality the resource advantage of the wealthy is one mechanism through which inequality has tangible effects on democratic performance and on the government s capacity to mitigate the vulnerability of insecure populations. Insecure populations contribute to political turmoil because they often blame existing parties with varying degrees of justification for their vulnerability and become available to support antidemocratic candidates. Economic resources can be divided. This means that competition over them can be managed in various ways. Importantly economic winners i.e. the wealthy can compensate economic losers i.e. the poor or at least protect them against severe vulnerability by supporting social welfare programs and institutions such as those established in the United States under the New Deal of the 1930s and the Great Society of the 1960s and in western European countries after World War II. The wealthy recognized that it was in their interest to accept and in some cases to actively support the redistribution of wealth partly because there was an alternative system embodied in the Soviet Union competing for the hearts and minds of workers in capitalist democracies. This incentive evaporated with the worldwide collapse of communism in 1989 91 see collapse of the Soviet Union one of the reasons that mainstream parties did so little for their most adversely affected populations in the wake of the Great Recession of 2007 09. A dramatic example was the response to the subprime mortgage crisis see financial crisis of 2007 08. Western governments regardless of their ruling party bailed out banks and other financial institutions while providing relatively little direct assistance to the millions of voters who lost their homes. This in turn contributed to the perception among vulnerable voters that none of the established parties was responding to their plight. Unlike economic resources racial ethnic or religious identities or affiliations are indivisible goods. Competition over indivisible goods is bad for democracy because it is much more often zerosum one group s gain is another s loss. This was a lesson of the religious wars in western Europe in the 16th and 17th centuries and later supplied an impetus to diminish the political power of the church if not to disestablish it entirely in modern democracies. Better to get religious groups out of politics than to have them vie for control of the commanding heights of the state. When electoral success hinges on religious ethnic or racial appeals candidates have few incentives to offer broadly encompassing policies such as those promoting inclusive economic growth and good public services. At its best democratic competition institutionalizes a marketplace of ideas encouraging candidates for office to make the strongest case for their proposed policies in order to rally support. Identity politics undermines this aspiration giving politicians incentives to court supporters along exclusionary sectarian lines. When politicians need only preach to the converted their incentive to offer powerful arguments rather than to appeal to sectarian loyalties is attenuated. The prominence of identity politics produces a more fragmented more polarized and less competitive political environment. Political mobilization along identitarian lines is a familiar problem in new democracies which often lack robust traditions of programmatic political competition. Elections all too easily amount to little more than an ethnic census where the minority has weak incentives to accept results and strong incentives to resort to violence. Since the late 20th century there has also been a resurgence of identity politics in the older democracies as political entrepreneurs have found it easy to mobilize alienated voters along ethnic racial religious and cultural lines. This kind of political mobilization tends to be selfreinforcing because it diverts attention from distributive and other economic matters where bargaining and compromise are possible. This in turn operates to the benefit of those such as the wealthy who do well from the status quo and would do less well from competition over matters relating to the distribution or division of material goods. Structuring politics around identity cleavages can reify and entrench these differences particularly because it contributes to the erosion of political parties that organize their appeals around unifying programmatic platforms. Across the developed world the established political organs of the left and right have lost strength and have been eclipsed by new nativist movements that frequently demonize immigrants and minority groups with ugly rhetoric. In some countries new extremist parties have displaced traditional parties and in others extremists have coopted traditional parties. The attrition of traditional parties and their replacement by parties and candidates that run on explicitly racist and xenophobic platforms threatens not just to elevate identity politics on the political stage but also to fan the flames of racial and ethnic antagonism in society broadly. Identity politics also undermines the benefits of political competition because it is largely symbolic. Political accountability depends on voters ability to assess the output that the government delivers and to decide whether to reward or punish incumbents on this basis. But symbolic politics yields few deliverables. When identity politics predominates voters decisions about whether to reward or punish officeholders correspond less to the tangible benefits that officeholders deliver to the electorate and more to how effectively they reinforce voters sense of belonging to one or another identitybased group. This can have adverse feedback effects by exacerbating economic insecurity and in turn voters disaffection from the political system. The polarization associated with identity politics undermines support for alternation of governance among political parties contributing to political instability. In other words when more of politics is zerosum every political faction faces higher costs if it loses in the political process. The identity politics of the right and the identity politics of the left are mutually dependent and mutually reinforcing. In a fragmented political environment where parties represent identitybased groups it becomes harder for politicians to succeed by offering encompassing programs and more congenial for them to focus on mobilizing their core supporters. Giving up power is more threatening to the interests of current winners and losers will be more likely to try to seize and hold on to power if they can. Institutions of political representation contribute to political fragmentation. In proportional representation PR systems fragmentation occurs between parties and in plurality voting PV systems fragmentation occurs within parties. Fragmentation facilitates clientlike relationships between voters and politicians the latter deliver benefits to particular groups rather than enacting policies that benefit society as a whole. PR gives rise to what one might think of as wholesale clientelism marked by catering to sectional interests at the expense of encompassing social interests whereas PV combined with weak political parties gives rise to retail clientelism where politicians cater to particular financial supporters or to cronies. PR enables a large number of parties to obtain legislative representation and to that extent diminishes parties incentive to advance encompassing policies that appeal to a large swathe of the electorate. As a result parties tend to cater to core supporters. Because they produce political fragmentation PR systems necessitate coalition governments which are frequently unwieldy increasingly so from the turn of the 21st century as the number of parties has increased in almost all PR systems. Accountability also suffers under coalition governments because no party is unambiguously responsible for the government s performance. Voters are more likely to support the party that represents their sectional interest regardless of government performance. Nor do the platforms parties run on in elections correspond closely with what they do once in power because coalition negotiations require compromise. And because parties decide on governing coalitions after elections the extent to which the government reflects popular will is more attenuated than it is when a single party is in power. Which parties succeed in joining the government can be quite arbitrary and the parties might emanate from a variety of points on the ideological spectrum. As a result there may be little direct connection between the preferences expressed by voters and the policies enacted by the government that their party has joined. PV systems of which the Westminster system the model of government in the United Kingdom which has traditionally centred on parliamentary supremacy and the absence of nonelectoral checks on parliamentary authority is the purest incarnation confront different challenges. They do not exhibit the interparty fragmentation seen in PR systems but problems regarding representation are created by the winner s bonus that might disproportionately reward the pluralityvote winner. In a PV system the party receiving the plurality of votes cast in an election typically wins a higher proportion indeed often a majority of seats. Depending on the geographical distribution of voters the pluralityvote winner may not even win the most legislative seats in a PV system. PV systems may therefore promote decisive governance at the expense of accurate representation of the electorate. There can also be fragmentation in PV systems but it occurs inside parties particularly when they are answerable to subsets of their members or to outside groups that they depend on for money. This weakens parties as institutions of effective governance. Intraparty fragmentation can therefore be exacerbated by institutions like primary elections and failures to effectively regulate the role of money in politics see campaign finance and campaign finance laws. Such fragmentation undermines the accountability of government to voters and contributes to gridlock impeding effective governance. The United States is an unusual hybrid wherein a PV system is counterbalanced by government institutions that stifle its advantages. The American disease as some critics of the system have named it is a profusion of veto points that amplify gridlock. The country has a bicameral system in which the two legislative chambers are governed by different rules and electoral cycles an independently elected president whose party often does not control at least one of the legislative chambers independent courts that can strike down duly enacted laws and a strong federal system that enables state legislatures and governors to frustrate national policies and priorities. The dramatic malapportionment of the U.S. Senate exacerbates the situation by enabling senators representing small minorities of the population to block legislation. These obstacles to effective government dramatically curtail the decisiveness typically associated with PV systems. They also encourage clientelism by requiring more logrolling and horse trading in the legislative process than would otherwise be required. And they advantage wealthy individuals and businesses which are better able than others to navigate the intricacies of the legislative process as well as its administrative and judicial accompaniments. Autocracies can pose threats to the healthy operation of democratic regimes. Russia s role as an important oil supplier to western Europe gives it some leverage over European politics just as China s foreign aid gives it influence over many developing countries. More discretely and dramatically autocracies may seek to influence democratic politics through strategies similar to those used by Russia to interfere in the 2016 U.S. presidential election including spreading disinformation to benefit certain candidates at the expense of others to foster extreme partisanship and hostility between political factions and to weaken the public s faith and trust in democratic institutions. If autocracies proliferate these kinds of external threats to democratic regimes might increase and become more serious. Another insidious mechanism for autocratic influence on democracies is ideological. Some political theorists have suggested that the apparent economic success of authoritarian countries like China Vietnam and Singapore undermines support for democracy by making alternative models of governance seem attractive. The mediumterm viability of their models is debatable however because authoritarian systems are highly susceptible to corruption and are notoriously poor at generating accurate information needed for sound decisionmaking in complex economies over time. Moreover some of the more successful Asian tigers are democracies like Taiwan and South Korea making it difficult to argue that Chinese economic success depends on an authoritarian governance model. More typical of authoritarian systems are the old Soviet bloc economies countries like North Korea and the African and Middle Eastern autocracies. The better economic performers among them are most often oil producers that reserve the great bulk of their financial gains for tiny elites. Thus if democracy s prestige is declining that trend has more to do with the struggling performance of democratic systems than with the viability of alternatives. This underperformance has fueled admiration within developed democracies for foreign autocrats like Russian Pres. Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orb n and for the kind of politics they represent. Propaganda and other means of manipulating public opinion have always been part of politics but technological developments in the 21st century have the potential to increase their potency. Internetbased social media was once seen as a potentially liberating technology that would facilitate the rapid spread of information and challenge both repressive regimes and the oligopoly of traditional news media but today the picture is more mixed. Authoritarian governments have succeeded in tightening control over Internet access and social media platforms have become vehicles for the spread of disinformation. While control of traditional media platforms remains an important vector for the spread of propaganda social media also enables the dissemination of disinformation via bottomup organizations that can circumvent gatekeepers or moderators of traditional platforms. Propaganda can thus be spread cheaply and in high volume making it difficult to combat. Recent technological developments also enable moreencompassing forms of surveillance with implications for political organization. Whether through physical surveillance of their movements or virtual surveillance of their online activities people are increasingly being monitored and recorded and they are likely to behave differently when they know that Big Brother might be watching. They might refrain from doing things that would result in social censure or other forms of punishment. Of particular concern is the fact that surveillance might subject dissidents to intimidation or retaliation for political activity. The availability of large amounts of data about citizens also facilitates political manipulation by enabling politicians to segment their messaging with targeted sometimes even mutually incompatible appeals to particular demographic groups. This contributes to political fragmentation further undermining accountability. There are possible cures for these worrying trends. Public policies can mitigate them through measures aimed at preserving election integrity freedom of speech and privacy. Civil society can also mitigate the antidemocratic effects of technology journalists can act in innovative ways to protect and disseminate accurate information and new techniques of social media governance can combat the prevalence of disinformation. Innovations in cryptography can enable people to avoid surveillance. On balance it is too soon to conclude that technological developments pose insuperable challenges to democratic competition. But the problems that they present will likely become more acute requiring an ongoing search for novel solutions.,

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/republic, Is the United States a democracy or a republic? One of the most commonly encountered questions about the word democracy has nothing to do with its spelling or pronunciation and isn t even directly related to the meaning of the word itself. That question is is the United States a democracy or a republic? The answer to this as with so many other questions about meaning may be phrased as some form of it depends.  Some people assert that a country calling itself a democracy must be engaged in direct or pure democracy in which the people of a state or region vote directly for policies rather than elect representatives who make choices on their behalf. People who follow this line of reasoning hold that the United States is more properly described as a republic using the following definition of that word a government in which supreme power resides in a body of citizens entitled to vote and is exercised by elected officers and representatives responsible to them and governing according to law. However both democracy and republic have more than a single meaning and one of the definitions we provide for democracy closely resembles the definition of republic given above a government in which the supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodically held free elections. So if someone asks you if the United States is a democracy or a republic you may safely answer the question with either both or it depends.

https://developers.democracy.works/, Democracy Works collects data about elections that happen in the US. We record this data in two entities one called an Election and onecalled an Authority. The Election has electionspecific dates and deadlines URLs to get moreinformation and take actions and detailed instructions. The informationincluded reflects the voter registration and voting methods available in thestate for that election such as online inperson and bymail registrationas well as bymail inperson and early voting. The Election also containssome information from the related Authority or Authorities in some cases. The Authority includes contact information available registrationmethods available voting methods statespecific URLs and more.Authorities do not contain electionspecific information such as dates andAuthority information generally does not change from election to election. Election and Authority data is based on Open Civic Data IDs OCDIDs soyou should familiarize yourself with how they work before jumping into therest of this document. Both Authorities and Elections are identified using an Open Civic Data IDOCDID. OCDIDs start with what is being identified and in our case it is alwaysocddivision. Then there is a treelike structure of strings where the longer theidentifier gets the more specific or finegrained the identifier becomes.In our case there is always countryus because we only cover USElections. We cover all 50 States and the District of Columbia.  Since all local Elections are contained within States every OCDID in oursystem except one starts with ocddivisioncountryusstate__ where__ is a twoletter state code.  The only exception to this is for the District of Columbia which has theOCDID ocddivisioncountryusdistrictdc. After the state the OCDID gets more specific by getting longer and usingvarious legal jurisdiction labels to indicate what area an Election orAuthority is covering. Some examples are  Sometimes a place is nested under a county and sometimes it is not. Thiscould indicate that the municipality is in multiple counties or that thereare multiple unique municipalities in the state with the same name but indifferent counties but not necessarily. curl H Accept applicationjson H Authorization apikey YOUR_API_KEY httpsapi.democracy.workselectionsupcoming?districtdivisionsocddivisioncountryusstateilplacechicagoThe response will contain an OCDID here curl H Accept applicationjson H Authorization apikey YOUR_API_KEY httpsapi.democracy.workselectionauthoritiesstatesThe response will contain an OCDID here There are two ways to get information on Election Authorities and both arefor the state level only.

https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/democracy, The United States is both a democracy and a republic. Democracies and republics are both forms of government in which supreme power resides in the citizens. The word republic refers specifically to a government in which those citizens elect representatives who govern according to the law. The word democracy can refer to this same kind of representational government or it can refer instead to what is also called a direct democracy in which the citizens themselves participate in the act of governing directly.  The word democracy most often refers to a form of government in which people choose leaders by voting. A democratic system of government is a form of government in which supreme power is vested in the people and exercised by them directly or indirectly through a system of representation usually involving periodic free elections.

https://www.coe.int/en/web/compass/democracy,  No one is born a good citizen no nation is born a democracy. Rather both are processes that continue to evolve over a lifetime. Young people must be included from birth.Kofi Annan Of the people by the people for the peopleAbraham Lincoln The word democracy comes from the Greek words demos meaning people and kratos meaning power so democracy can be thought of as power of the people a way of governing which depends on the will of the people. There are so many different models of democratic government around the world that it is sometimes easier to understand the idea of democracy in terms of what it definitely is not. Democracy then is not autocracy or dictatorship where one person rules and it is not oligarchy where a small segment of society rules. Properly understood democracy should not even be rule of the majority if that means that minorities interests are ignored completely. A democracy at least in theory is government on behalf of all the people according to their will. Question If democracy is government by the people are there any real democracies in the world? The idea of democracy derives its moral strength and popular appeal from two key principles1. Individual autonomy The idea that noone should be subject to rules which have been imposed by others. People should be able to control their own lives within reason.2. Equality The idea that everyone should have the same opportunity to influence the decisions that affect people in society. These principles are intuitively appealing and they help to explain why democracy is so popular. Of course we feel it is fair that we should have as much chance as anyone else to decide on common rules! The problems arise when we consider how the principles can be put into practice because we need a mechanism for deciding how to address conflicting views. Because it offers a simple mechanism democracy tends to be rule of the majority but rule of the majority can mean that some peoples interests are never represented. A more genuine way of representing everyones interests is to use decision making by consensus where the aim is to find common points of interest. Question What are the advantages and disadvantages of making decisions by consensus compared to using majority rule? How are decisions made in your youth group? The ancient Greeks are credited with creating the very first democracy although there were almost certainly earlier examples of primitive democracy in other parts of the world. The Greek model was established in the 5th century BC in the city of Athens. Among a sea of autocracies and oligarchies which were the normal forms of government at the time Athenian democracy stood out.However compared to how we understand democracy today the Athenian model had two important differences 1. Theirs was a form of direct democracy in other words instead of electing representatives to govern on the peoples behalf the people themselves met discussed questions of government and then implemented policy. Democracy is not the law of the majority but the protection of the minority.Albert Camus 2. Such a system was possible partly because the people was a very limited category. Those who could participate directly were a small part of the population since women slaves aliens and of course children were excluded. The numbers who participated were still far more than in a modern democracy perhaps 50000 males engaged directly in politics out of a population of around 300000 people. Question What are the advantages and disadvantages of direct democracy? While democracies share common features there is no single model of democracy.UN Resolution on promoting and consolidating democracy ARES627 Today there are as many different forms of democracy as there are democratic nations in the world. No two systems are exactly the same and no one system can be taken as a model. There are presidential and parliamentary democracies democracies that are federal or unitary democracies that use a proportional voting system and ones that use a majoritarian system democracies which are also monarchies and so on. One thing that unites modern systems of democracy and which also distinguishes them from the ancient model is the use of representatives of the people. Instead of taking part directly in law making modern democracies use elections to select representatives who are sent by the people to govern on their behalf. Such a system is known as representative democracy. It can lay some claim to being democratic because it is at least to some degree based on the two principles above equality of all one person one vote and the right of every individual to some degree of personal autonomy. Question What should an elected official do to make sure he or she is representing properly those who elected him or her? The right to vote is not a privilege. In the twentyfirst century the presumption in a democratic State must be in favour of inclusion ... Any departure from the principle of universal suffrage risks undermining the democratic validity of the legislature thus elected and the laws which it promulgates.Judgement of the European Court Hirst v. UK People often talk about countries becoming democracies once they start to have relatively free and open elections. But democracy includes far more than just elections and it really makes more sense to think about the will of the people idea rather than about institutional or voting structures when we are trying to assess how democratic a country is. Democracy is better understood as something that we can always have more or less of rather than something that either is or is not. Democratic systems can nearly always be made more inclusive more reflective of more peoples wishes and more responsive to their influence. In other words there is room to improve the people part of democracy by including more people in decision making there is also room to improve the power or will part of democracy by giving the people more real power. Struggles for democracy throughout history have normally concentrated on one or the other of these elements. Today in most countries of the world women do have the vote but the struggle has been won only relatively recently. New Zealand is said to be the first country in the world to have introduced universal suffrage in 1893 although even here women were only granted the right to stand for parliament in 1919. Many countries have granted women the right to vote first of all and only several years later have allowed them to stand for elected office. Saudi Arabia has only granted women the power to vote in elections in 2011. Today even in established democracies there are other sections of society which commonly include immigrants migrant workers prisoners and children who are not given the right to vote even though many of them might pay taxes and all are obliged to obey the laws of the land. Prisoners and voting rightsPrisoners are allowed to vote in 18 European countries.Prisoners rights to vote are restricted in 20 countries depending on such things as length of sentence or severity of the crime committed or the type of election.In 9 European countries prisoners are not allowed to vote at all.Prisoners voting rights Commons Library Standard Note SNPC01764 last updated in 2012 httpwww.parliament.ukbriefingpapersSN01764In the case of Hirst v. the United Kingdom in 2005 the European Court found that the universal ban on prisoners from voting in the UK was a violation of Article 3 Protocol 1 of the European Convention which says thatThe High Contracting Parties undertake to hold free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot under conditions which will ensure the freeexpression of the opinion of the people in the choice of the legislature. Question Can excluding certain sectors of society from the democratic process ever be justified? I dont have any formula for ousting a dictator or building democracy. All I can suggest is to forget about yourself and just think of your people. Its always the people who make things happen.Corazon Aquino The most obvious ways to participate in government are to vote or to stand for office and become a representative of the people. Democracy however is about far more than just voting and there are numerous other ways of engaging with politics and government. The effective functioning of democracy in fact depends on ordinary people using these other means as much as possible. If people only vote once every 4 or 5 years or do not vote at all and if they do nothing else in the interim then government really cannot be said to be by the people. It is hard to say that such a system is a democracy.You can read in more detail about ways of participating in the section on Citizenship and Participation. Here are a few ideas perhaps the minimum that might be needed for members of parliament to be able to act democratically on your behalfStay informed about what is happening what is being decided in the name of the people and in particular about the decisions and actions being taken by your own representative.Make your opinions known either to your representatives in parliament or to the media or to groups working on particular issues. Without feedback from the people leaders can only lead according to their own will and priorities.Where decisions appear to be undemocratic or against human rights or even when you just feel strongly about them make efforts to get your voice heard so that the policies may be reconsidered. The most effective way of doing this is probably by joining with other people so that your voice is louder.Vote when the possibility arises. If people do not vote then members are effectively unaccountable. Question Have you ever participated in any of these ways or others? The connection between human rights and democracy is deep and goes both ways each is in some way dependent on the other and incomplete without the other. Everyone has the right to take part in the government of his country directly or through freely chosen representatives.Article 21 part 1 UDHR First of all the values of equality and autonomy are also human rights values and the right to take part in government is itself a human right. Article 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights UDHR tells us that The will of the people shall be the basis of the authority of government so democracy is in fact the only form of government which is consistent with human rights. However a democracy is also incomplete without a thoroughgoing respect for human rights. Taking part in government in a genuine way is almost impossible to do without people having other basic rights respected. Consider the following as examples1. Freedom of thought conscience and religion UDHR Article 18. This is one of the first rights which are essential in a democracy people need to be able to think freely to hold whatever beliefs are important to them without being punished for doing so. Governments throughout history have tried to limit this right because they are afraid that if people think about other forms of government this will endanger the current system. So they have locked people away simply for thinking the wrong thoughts. Such people are known as prisoners of conscience. However a society without a pluralism of views is not just intolerant it also limits its own possibilities to develop in new and possibly improved directions. 2. Freedom of Expression UDHR Article 19. It is important not just to be able to think what you want but also to be able to express that opinion out loud whatever that opinion may be. If people are prevented from discussing their views with other people or presenting them in the media how can they take part in government? Their opinion has essentially been discounted from the possible alternatives under consideration. Democracy doesnt recognize east or west democracy is simply peoples will.Shirin Ebadi 3. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association UDHR Article 20. This right allows you to discuss ideas with others who want to do so to form interest groups or lobbying groups or to gather together for the purposes of protest against decisions you disagree with. Perhaps such an activity is sometimes inconvenient for governments however it is essential if different views are to be made known and taken into account. And that is part of what democracy is all about. These are just three human rights which are intrinsically bound up with the idea of democracy but any infringement of other human rights will also affect the extent to which different people are able to take part in government. Poverty poor health or the lack of a home can all make it more difficult for someone to have their voice heard and diminish the impact of their choice compared with others. Such infringements of rights almost certainly make it impossible for the person concerned to be elected to government office. Question How well are the three democratic rights listed above respected in your country? Democracy doesnt mean much if you are hungry or homeless or have no health care or your children cant go to school even if you have a vote democracy is not effective.Susan George President of ATTAC For a number of years there has been concern about the status of democracy perhaps particularly in the more established democracies. Much of this is based on the decreasing levels of citizen participation at elections which appear to indicate a lack of interest and involvement on the part of citizens. A low voter turnout calls into question the legitimacy of socalled democratically elected governments which are in some countries actually elected by a minority of the total electorate. Elections and apathyTurnout at elections to the European Parliament has fallen every year since the first elections in 1979. In 2009 only 43 of the electorate used their vote and in some countries turnout fell as low as 34.In national elections throughout Europe turnout ranges from just over 50 in some countries to over 90 in others.Some countries for example Greece and Belgium in Europe make voting compulsory. In such countries turnout is obviously much higher than the average for countries where voting is optional. Question What proportion of the electorate voted in your countrys most recent elections? Although it is undoubtedly a problem that people are increasingly failing to vote in elections there are some studies which indicate that participation in different forms may actually be on the increase for example pressure groups civic initiatives consultative organs and so on. These forms of participation are just as important to the effective functioning of democracy as voter turnout at elections if not more so. Democracy and civic participationThe socalled Arab Spring where masses of people many of them young took to the streets in order to express their dissatisfaction with the government has shown a new level of civic participation in countries which have not traditionally been regarded as democracies. In Europe as well even in the more traditional democracies people power appears to have found a new lease of life students have protested in many countries against moves by governments to impose fees on education. Trade unions have brought people onto the streets to protest about the impact of economic cuts. In addition autonomous groups of activists have invented new and creative forms of demonstrating against climate change the power of large corporations the withdrawal of key state services and also against oppressive measures of policing. A minority may be right and a majority is always wrong.Henrik Ibsen There are two problems that are more intricately connected to the notion of representative democracy and these concern minority interests. The first problem is that minority interests are often not represented through the electoral system this may happen if their numbers are too few to reach the minimum level necessary for any representation. The second problem is that even if their numbers are represented in the legislative body they will have a minority of representatives and these may not therefore be able to summon up the necessary votes to defeat the majority representatives. For these reasons democracy is often referred to as rule of the majority. Majority rule if not backed up by a guarantee of human rights for all can lead to decisions which are harmful to minorities and the fact that these decisions are the will of the people can provide no justification. The basic interests of minorities as well as majorities need to be safeguarded in any democratic system by adherence to human rights principles reinforced by an effective legal mechanism whatever the will of the majority may be. Question If the majority of the population is in favour of depriving certain people their human rights do you think the people should decide? Democracy is best conceived as a process of democratization.Patom kimTeivainen A related problem is the worrying trends across Europe towards support for extreme right parties. These parties have often played on nationalist feelings and have targeted nonindigenous members of the population particularly asylum seekers refugees and members of religious minorities and sometimes in violent ways. As a defence such parties often appeal to their support among the population and the democratic principle that they represent the opinions of a large number of people. However where a party advocates violence in any form and where it fails to respect the human rights of every member of the population it has little right to appeal to democratic principles. Depending on the extent of the problem and the particular cultural context it may be necessary to limit the right to freedom of expression of certain groups despite the importance of this right to the democratic process. Most countries for example have laws against inciting racial hatred. This is regarded by the European Court as an acceptable limitation of freedom of expression justified by the need to protect the rights of other members of society or the structure of society itself. Question Is nationalism any different from racism? Young people often do not even have the vote so how can they be a part of the democratic process?Many people would answer this question by saying that young people are not ready to be part of the process and that only when they are 18 or at whatever age their country gives them the vote will they be able to participate. In fact many young people are politically very active long before they get the vote and in some ways the impact of such activity can be stronger than the single vote they receive later on and may or may not decide to use once every 4 or 5 years. Politicians are often anxious to appeal to the youth vote so they may be more likely to listen to the concerns of young people. Many young people are engaged in environmental groups or in other protest groups campaigning against war against corporate exploitation or against child labour. Perhaps one of the most important ways that young people can begin to be engaged in community life and political activity is at a local level here they will be more aware of the particular issues that are of concern to them and those with whom they come into contact and they will be better able to have a direct impact. Democracy does not only deal with national or international issues it needs to begin in our own neighbourhoods!Youth organisations are one of the ways through which young people experience and practise democracy and therefore have an important role in democracy provided of course that they are independent and democratic in the way they function! Question If a 16yearold is considered mature enough to marry and get a job should he or she not be able to vote? We will strive for our common goal of promoting democracy and good governance of the highest quality nationally regionally and locally for all our citizens.Action Plan of the Warsaw Summit of the Council of Europe 2005 Democracy is one of the core values of the Council of Europe together with human rights and the rule of law. The Council of Europe has a number of programmes and publications looking at the improvement and future of democracy. In 2005 the Forum for the Future of Democracy was established by the Third Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Council of Europe. The aim of the Forum is to strengthen democracy political freedoms and citizens participation through the exchange of ideas information and examples of best practices. A meeting of the Forum takes place every year and brings together about 400 participants from the 47 Council of Europe member States and observer States. Support for development and implementation of standards for democracy is carried by the European Commission for Democracy through Law also known as the Venice Commission which is the Council of Europes advisory body on constitutional matters. The commission has been particularly active in assisting in the drafting of new constitutions or laws on constitutional courts electoral codes minority rights and the legal framework relating to democratic institutions. In addition to this standardsetting work the Council of Europe promotes democracy and its values by programmes on democratic participation education for democratic citizenship and youth participation because democracy is much more than voting in elections!

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_democracy, A democracy is a political system or a system of decisionmaking within an institution organization or state in which members have a share of power. 2 Modern democracies are characterized by two capabilities of their citizens that differentiate them fundamentally from earlier forms of government to intervene in society and have their sovereign e.g. their representatives held accountable to the international laws of other governments of their kind. Democratic government is commonly juxtaposed with oligarchic and monarchic systems which are ruled by a minority and a sole monarch respectively. Democracy is generally associated vague with the efforts of the ancient Greeks whom 18thcentury intellectuals who? considered the founders of Western civilization. These individuals attempted to leverage these early democratic experiments into a new template for postmonarchical political organization. 3 page needed The extent to which these 18thcentury democratic revivalists succeeded in turning the democratic ideals of the ancient Greeks into the dominant political institution of the next 300 years is hardly debatable even if the moral justifications they often employed might be. Nevertheless the critical historical juncture catalyzed by the resurrection of democratic ideals and institutions fundamentally transformed the ensuing centuries and has dominated the international landscape since the dismantling of the final vestige of the empire following the end of the Second World War. Modern representative democracies attempt to bridge the gap between Rousseaus depiction of the state of nature and Hobbess depiction of society as inevitably authoritarian through social contracts that enshrine the rights of the citizens curtail the power of the state and grant agency through the right to vote. 4  Anthropologists have identified forms of protodemocracy that date back to small bands of huntergatherers that predate the establishment of agrarian sedentary societies and still exist virtually unchanged disputed discuss in isolated indigenous groups today. In these groups of generally 50100 individuals often tied closely by familial bonds decisions are reached by consensus or majority and many times without the designation of any specific chief. 4  These types of democracy are commonly identified as tribalism or primitive democracy. In this sense a primitive democracy usually takes shape in small communities or villages when there are facetoface discussions in a village council or with a leader who has the backing of village elders or other cooperative forms of government. 5 verification needed This becomes more complex on a larger scale such as when the village and city are examined more broadly as political communities. All other forms of rule including monarchy tyranny aristocracy and oligarchy have flourished in more urban centers often those with concentrated populations. 6 verification needed disputed discuss David Graeber and David Wengrow in The Dawn of Everything however argue that cities and early settlements were more varied and unpredictable in terms of how their political systems alternated and evolved from more to less democratic. 7  The concepts and name of democracy and constitution as a form of government originated in ancient Athens circa 508 BCE. In ancient Greece where there were many citystates with different forms of government democracy was contrasted with governance by elites aristocracy by one person monarchy by tyrants tyranny etc. Although fifthcentury BC Athens is widely considered to have been the first state to develop a sophisticated system of rule that we today call democracy 8 9 10 11 12 13 in recent decades scholars have explored the possibility that advancements toward democratic government occurred independently in the Near East the Indian subcontinent and elsewhere before this. 14  The practice of governing by assembly was at least part of how ancient Phoenicians made important decisions. One source is the story of WenAmon an Egyptian trader who travelled north to the Phoenician city of Byblos around 1100 BCE to trade for Phoenician lumber. After loading his lumber a group of pirates surrounded WenAmon and his cargo ship. The Phoenician prince of Baylon was called in to fix the problem whereupon he summoned his mwdwt an old Semitic word meaning assembly to reach a decision. This shows that Byblos was ruled in part by a popular assembly drawn from what subpopulation and equipped with exactly what power is not known exactly. 15  Studying preBabylonian Mesopotamia Thorkild Jacobsen used Sumerian epic myth and historical records to identify what he has called primitive democracy. By this Jacobsen means a government in which ultimate power rests with the mass of free nonslave male citizens although the various functions of government are as yet little specialised and the power structure is loose. In early Sumer kings like Gilgamesh did not hold the autocratic power that later Mesopotamian rulers wielded. Rather major citystates functioned with councils of elders and young men likely free men bearing arms that possessed the final political authority and had to be consulted on all major issues such as war. 16 17  The work has gained little outright acceptance. Scholars criticize the use of the word democracy in this context since the same evidence also can be interpreted to demonstrate a power struggle between primitive monarchy and noble classes a struggle in which the common people function more like pawns rather than any kind of sovereign authority. 18 Jacobsen conceded that the vagueness of the evidence prohibits the separation between the Mesopotamian democracy from a primitive oligarchy. 19  Another claim for early democratic institutions comes from the independent republics of India sa ghas and ga as which existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century. In addition Diodorus a Greek historian who wrote two centuries after the time of Alexander the Greats invasion of India mentions that independent and democratic states existed in India. 20  Key characteristics of the ga a seem to include a monarch usually known by the name raja and a deliberative assembly. The assembly met regularly. It discussed all major state decisions. At least in some states attendance was open to all free men. This body also had full financial administrative and judicial authority. Other officers who rarely receive any mention obeyed the decisions of the assembly. Elected by the ga a the monarch apparently always belonged to a family of the noble class of Kshatriya Varna. The monarch coordinated his activities with the assembly in some states he did so with a council of other nobles. 21 The Licchavis had a primary governing body of 7077 rajas presumably the heads of the most important families. In contrast the Shakyas during the period around Gautama Buddha had the assembly open to all men rich and poor. 22 Early republics or ga asa gha 23 such as Mallakas centered in the city of Kusinagara and the Vajji or V ji League centered in the city of Vaishali existed as early as the 6th century BCE and persisted in some areas until the 4th century CE. 24 The most famous clan amongst the ruling confederate tribes of the Vajji Mahajanapada were the Licchavis. 25 The Magadha kingdom included republican communities such as the community of Rajakumara. Villages had their own assemblies under their local chiefs called Gramakas. Their administrations were divided into executive judicial and military functions. Scholars differ over how best to describe these governments and the vague sporadic quality of the evidence allows for wide disagreements. Some emphasize the central role of the assemblies and thus tout them as democracies other scholars focus on the upperclass domination of the leadership and possible control of the assembly and see an oligarchy or an aristocracy. 26 27 Despite the assemblys obvious power it has not yet been established whether the composition and participation were truly popular. The first main obstacle is the lack of evidence describing the popular power of the assembly. This is reflected in the Arthashastra an ancient handbook for monarchs on how to rule efficiently. It contains a chapter on how to deal with the sangas which includes injunctions on manipulating the noble leaders yet it does not mention how to influence the mass of the citizens a surprising omission if democratic bodies not the aristocratic families actively controlled the republican governments. 28 Another issue is the persistence of the fourtiered Varna class system. 26 The duties and privileges on the members of each particular caste rigid enough to prohibit someone sharing a meal with those of another order might have affected the roles members were expected to play in the state regardless of the formality of the institutions. A central tenet of democracy is the notion of shared decisionmaking power. The absence of any concrete notion of citizen equality across these caste system boundaries leads many scholars to claim that the true nature of ga as and sa ghas is not comparable to truly democratic institutions. 27  Ancient Greece in its early period was a loose collection of independent city states called poleis. Many of these poleis were oligarchies. 29 The most prominent Greek oligarchy and the state with which democratic Athens is most often and most fruitfully compared was Sparta. Yet Sparta in its rejection of private wealth as a primary social differentiator was a peculiar kind of oligarchy 30 and some scholars note its resemblance to democracy. 8 31 32 In Spartan government the political power was divided between four bodies two Spartan kings diarchy gerousia Council of Gerontes elders including the two kings the ephors representatives of the citizens who oversaw the kings and the ecclesia assembly of Spartans. The two kings served as the head of the government. They ruled simultaneously but they came from two separate lines. The dual kingship diluted the effective power of the executive office. The kings shared their judicial functions with other members of the gerousia. The members of the gerousia had to be over the age of 60 and were elected for life. In theory any Spartan over that age could stand for election. However in practice they were selected from wealthy aristocratic families. The gerousia possessed the crucial power of legislative initiative. Apella the most democratic element was the assembly where Spartans above the age of 30 elected the members of the gerousia and the ephors and accepted or rejected gerousias proposals. 33 Finally the five ephors were Spartans chosen in apella to oversee the actions of the kings and other public officials and if necessary depose them. They served for one year and could not be reelected for a second term. Over the years the ephors held great influence on the formation of foreign policy and acted as the main executive body of the state. Additionally they had full responsibility for the Spartan educational system which was essential for maintaining the high standards of the Spartan army. As Aristotle noted ephors were the most important key institution of the state but because often they were appointed from the whole social body it resulted in very poor men holding office with the ensuing possibility that they could easily be bribed. 34 35  The creator of the Spartan system of rule was the legendary lawgiver Lycurgus. He is associated with the drastic reforms that were instituted in Sparta after the revolt of the helots in the second half of the 7th century BCE. In order to prevent another helot revolt Lycurgus devised the highly militarized communal system that made Sparta unique among the citystates of Greece. All his reforms were directed towards the three Spartan virtues equality among citizens military fitness and austerity. It is also probable that Lycurgus delineated the powers of the two traditional organs of the Spartan government the gerousia and the apella. 36  The reforms of Lycurgus were written as a list of ruleslaws called Great Rhetra making it the worlds first written constitution. 37 In the following centuries Sparta became a military superpower and its system of rule was admired throughout the Greek world for its political stability. 38 In particular the concept of equality played an important role in Spartan society. The Spartans referred to themselves as Homoioi men of equal status. It was also reflected in the Spartan public educational system agoge where all citizens irrespective of wealth or status had the same education. 32 This was admired almost universally by contemporaries from historians such as Herodotus and Xenophon to philosophers such as Plato and Aristotle. In addition the Spartan women unlike elsewhere enjoyed every kind of luxury and intemperance including rights such as the right to inheritance property ownership and public education. 39  Overall the Spartans were relatively free to criticize their kings and they were able to depose and exile them. However despite these democratic elements in the Spartan constitution there are two cardinal criticisms classifying Sparta as an oligarchy. First individual freedom was restricted since as Plutarch writes no man was allowed to live as he wished but as in a military camp all were engaged in the public service of their polis. And second the gerousia effectively maintained the biggest share of power of the various governmental bodies. 40 41  The political stability of Sparta also meant that no significant changes in the constitution were made. The oligarchic elements of Sparta became even stronger especially after the influx of gold and silver from the victories in the Persian Wars. In addition Athens after the Persian Wars was becoming the hegemonic power in the Greek world and disagreements between Sparta and Athens over supremacy emerged. These led to a series of armed conflicts known as the Peloponnesian War with Sparta prevailing in the end. However the war exhausted both poleis and Sparta was in turn humbled by Thebes at the Battle of Leuctra in 371 BCE. It was all brought to an end a few years later when Philip II of Macedon crushed what remained of the power of the factional citystates to his South. Athens is often regardedi by western scholars as the birthplace of democracy and remains an important reference point for democracy as evidenced by the etymological origins of democracy in English and many other languages being traced back to the Greek words d mos common people and kr tos forcemight. 42 Literature about the Athenian democracy spans over centuries with the earliest works being The Republic of Plato and Politics of Aristotle continuing with Discourses of Niccol Machiavelli. Athens emerged in the 7th century BCE like many other poleis with a dominating powerful aristocracy. 43 However this domination led to exploitation creating significant economic political and social problems. These problems were exacerbated early in the 6th century and as the many were enslaved to few the people rose against the notables. 44 At the same time a number of popular revolutions disrupted traditional aristocracies. This included Sparta in the second half of the 7th century BCE. The constitutional reforms implemented by Lycurgus in Sparta introduced a hoplite state that showed in turn how inherited governments can be changed and lead to military victory. 45 After a period of unrest between the rich and poor Athenians of all classes turned to Solon to act as a mediator between rival factions and reached a generally satisfactory solution to their problems. 46 47  Solon c. 638 c. 558 BCE an Athenian Greek of noble descent but moderate means was a lyric poet and later a lawmaker Plutarch ranked him as one of the Seven Sages of the ancient world. 47 Solon attempted to satisfy all sides by alleviating the suffering of the poor majority without removing all the privileges of the rich minority. 48 Solon divided the Athenians into four property classes with different rights and duties for each. As the Rhetra did in Lycurgian Sparta Solon formalized the composition and functions of the governmental bodies. All citizens gained the right to attend the Ecclesia Assembly and to vote. The Ecclesia became in principle the sovereign body entitled to pass laws and decrees elect officials and hear appeals from the most important decisions of the courts. 47 All but those in the poorest group might serve a year at a time on a new Boule of 400 which was to prepare the agenda for the Ecclesia. The higher governmental posts those of the archons magistrates were reserved for citizens of the top two income groups. The retired archons became members of the Areopagus Council of the Hill of Ares which like the Gerousia in Sparta was able to check improper actions of the newly powerful Ecclesia. Solon created a mixed timocratic and democratic system of institutions. 49  Overall Solon devised the reforms of 594 BCE to avert the political economic and moral decline in archaic Athens and gave Athens its first comprehensive code of law. The constitutional reforms eliminated enslavement of Athenians by Athenians established rules for legal redress against overreaching aristocratic archons and assigned political privileges on the basis of productive wealth rather than of noble birth. Some of Solons reforms failed in the short term yet he is often quantify credited with having laid the foundations for Athenian democracy. 50 51  Even though the Solonian reorganization of the constitution improved the economic position of the Athenian lower classes it did not eliminate the bitter aristocratic contentions for control of the archonship the chief executive post. Peisistratus became tyrant of Athens three times from 561 BCE and remained in power until his death in 527 BCE. His sons Hippias and Hipparchus succeeded him. 52  After the fall of tyranny 510 BCE and before the year 508 507 was over Cleisthenes proposed a complete reform of the system of government which later was approved by the popular Ecclesia. 53 Cleisthenes reorganized the population of citizens into ten tribes with the aim to change the basis of political organization from the family loyalties to political ones 54 and improve the armys organization. 55 He also introduced the principle of equality of rights for all male citizens isonomia 53 by expanding access to power to more citizens. 56 During this period Athenians first used the word democracy Greek rule by the people to define their new system of government. 9 In the next generation Athens entered its Golden Age becoming a great center of literature and art. 57 Greek victories in Persian Wars 499 449 BCE encouraged the poorest Athenians who participated in the military campaigns to demand a greater say in the running of their city. In the late 460s Ephialtes and Pericles presided over a radicalization of power that shifted the balance decisively to the poorest sections of society by passing laws which severely limited the powers of the Council of the Areopagus and allowed thetes Athenians without wealth to occupy public office. 58 Pericles became distinguished as the Athenians greatest democratic leader even though he has been accused of running a political machine. citation needed In the following passage Thucydides recorded Pericles in the funeral oration describing the Athenian system of rule Its administration favors the many instead of the few this is why it is called a democracy. If we look to the laws they afford equal justice to all in their private differences if no social standing advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit nor again does poverty bar the way if a man is able to serve the state he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life. 59  The Athenian democracy of Cleisthenes and Pericles was based on freedom of citizens through the reforms of Solon and on equality of citizens isonomia introduced by Cleisthenes and later expanded by Ephialtes and Pericles. To preserve these principles the Athenians used lot for selecting officials. Casting lots aimed to ensure that all citizens were equally qualified for office and to avoid any corruption allotment machines were used. 60 Moreover in most positions chosen by lot Athenian citizens could not be selected more than once this rotation in office meant that noone could build up a power base through staying in a particular position. 61  The courts formed another important political institution in Athens they were composed of a large number of juries with no judges and they were selected by lot on a daily basis from an annual pool also chosen by lot. The courts had unlimited power to control the other bodies of the government and its political leaders. 6 Participation by the citizens selected was mandatory 62 and a modest financial compensation was given to citizens whose livelihood was affected by being drafted to office. The only officials chosen by elections one from each tribe were the strategoi generals where military knowledge was required and the treasurers who had to be wealthy since any funds revealed to have been embezzled were recovered from a treasurers private fortune. Debate was open to all present and decisions in all matters of policy were taken by majority vote in the Ecclesia compare direct democracy in which all male citizens could participate in some cases with a quorum of 6000. The decisions taken in the Ecclesia were executed by the Boule of 500 which had already approved the agenda for the Ecclesia. The Athenian Boule was elected by lot every year 63 and no citizen could serve more than twice. 64  Overall the Athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people but also directest in the sense that the people through the assembly boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. 65 And even though the rights of the individual probably were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern senseii the Athenians enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person. 9  Within the Athenian democratic environment many philosophers from all over the Greek world gathered to develop their theories. Socrates 470399 BCE was the first to raise the question further expanded by his pupil Plato died 348347 about the relationposition of an individual within a community. Aristotle 384 322 BCE continued the work of his teacher Plato and laid the foundations of political philosophy. The political philosophy developed in Athens was in the words of Peter Hall in a form so complete that hardly added anyone of moment to it for over a millennium. 66 Aristotle systematically analyzed the different systems of rule that the numerous Greek citystates had and divided them into three categories based on how many ruled the many democracypolity the few oligarchyaristocracy a single person tyranny or today autocracymonarchy. For Aristotle the underlying principles of democracy are reflected in his work Politics Now a fundamental principle of the democratic form of constitution is liberty that is what is usually asserted implying that only under this constitution do men participate in liberty for they assert this as the aim of every democracy. But one factor of liberty is to govern and be governed in turn for the popular principle of justice is to have equality according to number not worth and if this is the principle of justice prevailing the multitude must of necessity be sovereign and the decision of the majority must be final and must constitute justice for they say that each of the citizens ought to have an equal share so that it results that in democracies the poor are more powerful than the rich because there are more of them and whatever is decided by the majority is sovereign. This then is one mark of liberty which all democrats set down as a principle of the constitution. And one is for a man to live as he likes for they say that this is the function of liberty inasmuch as to live not as one likes is the life of a man that is a slave. This is the second principle of democracy and from it has come the claim not to be governed preferably not by anybody or failing that to govern and be governed in turns and this is the way in which the second principle contributes to equalitarian liberty. 67  The Athenian democracy in its two centuries of lifetime twice voted against its democratic constitution both times during the crisis at the end of the Pelopponesian War of 431 to 404 BCE establishing first the Four Hundred in 411 BCE and second Spartas puppet r gime of the Thirty Tyrants in 404 BCE. Both votes took place under manipulation and pressure but democracy was recovered in less than a year in both cases. Reforms following the restoration of democracy after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants removed most lawmaking authority from the Assembly and placed it in randomly selected lawmaking juries known as nomothetai. Athens restored its democratic constitution again after King Philip II of Macedon reigned 359336 BCE and later Alexander the Great reigned 336 323 BCE unified Greece but it was politically overshadowed by the Hellenistic empires. Finally after the Roman conquest of Greece in 146 BCE Athens was restricted to matters of local administration. However democracy in Athens declined not only due to external powers but due to its citizens such as Plato and his student Aristotle. Because of their influential works after the rediscovery of classics during the Renaissance Spartas political stability was praised 68 69 10 while the Periclean democracy was described as a system of rule where either the less wellborn the mob as a collective tyrant or the poorer classes held power. 9 Only centuries afterwards after the publication of A History of Greece by George Grote from 1846 onwards did modern political thinkers start to view the Athenian democracy of Pericles positively. 70 In the late 20th century scholars reexamined the Athenian system of rule as a model of empowering citizens and as a postmodern example for communities and organizations alike. 71  Romes history has helped preserve the concept of democracy over the centuries. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. 72 Additionally the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries 73 and todays modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models. 74  Rome was a citystate in Italy next to powerful neighbors Etruscans had built citystates throughout central Italy since the 13th century BCE and in the south were Greek colonies. Similar to other citystates Rome was ruled by a king elected by the Assemblies. However social unrest and the pressure of external threats led in 510 BCE the last king to be deposed by a group of aristocrats led by Lucius Junius Brutus. 75 76 A new constitution was crafted but the conflict between the ruling families patricians and the rest of the population the plebeians continued. The plebs were demanding for definite written and secular laws. The patrician priests who were the recorders and interpreters of the statutes by keeping their records secret used their monopoly against social change. After a long resistance to the new demands the Senate in 454 BCE sent a commission of three patricians to Greece to study and report on the legislation of Solon and other lawmakers. 75 76 When they returned the Assembly in 451 BCE chose ten men a decemviri to formulate a new code and gave them supreme governmental power in Rome for two years. This commission under the supervision of a resolute reactionary Appius Claudius transformed the old customary law of Rome into Twelve Tables and submitted them to the Assembly which passed them with some changes and they were displayed in the Forum for all who would and could read. The Twelve Tables recognised certain rights and by the 4th century BCE the plebs were given the right to stand for consulship and other major offices of the state. The political structure as outlined in the Roman constitution resembled a mixed constitution 77 and its constituent parts were comparable to those of the Spartan constitution two consuls embodying the monarchic form the Senate embodying the aristocratic form and the people through the assemblies. 78 The consul was the highest ranking ordinary magistrate. 79 Consuls had power in both civil and military matters. While in the city of Rome the consuls were the head of the Roman government and they would preside over the Senate and the assemblies. While abroad each consul would command an army. The Senate passed decrees which were called senatus consultum and were official advices to a magistrate. However in practice it was difficult for a magistrate to ignore the Senates advice. 79 The focus of the Roman Senate was directed towards foreign policy. Though it technically had no official role in the management of military conflict the Senate ultimately was the force that oversaw such affairs. Also it managed Romes civil administration. The requirements for becoming a senator included having at least 100000 denarii worth of land being born of the patrician noble aristocrats class and having held public office at least once before. New Senators had to be approved by the sitting members. 79 The people of Rome through the assemblies had the final say regarding the election of magistrates the enactment of new laws the carrying out of capital punishment the declaration of war and peace and the creation or dissolution of alliances. Despite the obvious power the assemblies had in practice the assemblies were the least powerful of the other bodies of government. An assembly was legal only if summoned by a magistrate 79 and it was restricted from any legislative initiative or the ability to debate. And even the candidates for public office as Livy writes levels were designed so that no one appeared to be excluded from an election and yet all of the clout resided with the leading men. 80 Moreover the unequal weight of votes was making a rare practice for asking the lowest classes for their votes. 80 81  Roman stability in Polybius assessment was owing to the checks each element put on the superiority of any other a consul at war for example required the cooperation of the Senate and the people if he hoped to secure victory and glory and could not be indifferent to their wishes. This was not to say that the balance was in every way even Polybius observes that the superiority of the Roman to the Carthaginian constitution another mixed constitution at the time of the Hannibalic War was an effect of the latters greater inclination toward democracy than to aristocracy. 82 Moreover recent attempts to posit for Rome personal freedom in the Greek sense eleutheria living as you like have fallen on stony ground since eleutheria which was an ideology and way of life in the democratic Athens 83 was anathema in the Roman eyes. 84 Romes core values included order hierarchy discipline and obedience. These values were enforced with laws regulating the private life of an individual. The laws were applied in particular to the upper classes since the upper classes were the source of Roman moral examples. Rome became the ruler of a great Mediterranean empire. The new provinces brought wealth to Italy and fortunes were made through mineral concessions and enormous slave run estates. Slaves were imported to Italy and wealthy landowners soon began to buy up and displace the original peasant farmers. By the late 2nd century this led to renewed conflict between the rich and poor and demands from the latter for reform of the constitution. The background of social unease and the inability of the traditional republican constitutions to adapt to the needs of the growing empire led to the rise of a series of overmighty generals championing the cause of either the rich or the poor in the last century BCE. Over the next few hundred years various generals would bypass or overthrow the Senate for various reasons mostly to address perceived injustices either against themselves or against poorer citizens or soldiers. One of those generals was Julius Caesar where he marched on Rome and took supreme power over the republic. Caesars career was cut short by his assassination at Rome in 44 BCE by a group of Senators including Marcus Junius Brutus. In the power vacuum that followed Caesars assassination his friend and chief lieutenant Marcus Antonius and Caesars grandnephew Octavian who also was the adopted son of Caesar rose to prominence. Their combined strength gave the triumvirs absolute power. However in 31 BCE war between the two broke out. The final confrontation occurred on 2 September 31 BCE at the naval Battle of Actium where the fleet of Octavian under the command of Agrippa routed Antonys fleet. Thereafter there was no one left in the Roman Republic who wanted to or could stand against Octavian and the adopted son of Caesar moved to take absolute control. Octavian left the majority of Republican institutions intact though he influenced everything using personal authority and ultimately controlled the final decisions having the military might to back up his rule if necessary. By 27 BCE the transition though subtle disguised and relying on personal power over the power of offices was complete. In that year Octavian offered back all his powers to the Senate and in a carefully staged way the Senate refused and titled Octavian Augustus the revered one. He was always careful to avoid the title of rex king and instead took on the titles of princeps first citizen and imperator a title given by Roman troops to their victorious commanders completing the transition from the Roman Republic to the Roman Empire.  Professor of anthropology Jack Weatherford has argued that the ideas leading to the United States Constitution and democracy derived from various indigenous peoples of the Americas including the Iroquois. Weatherford speculated that this democracy was founded between the years 1000 1450 that it lasted several hundred years and that the U.S. democratic system was continually changed and improved by the influence of Native Americans throughout North America. 96  Elizabeth Tooker a professor of anthropology at Temple University and an authority on the culture and history of the Northern Iroquois has reviewed Weatherfords claims and concluded they are myth rather than fact. The idea that North American Indians had a democratic culture is several decades old but not usually expressed within historical literature. The relationship between the Iroquois League and the Constitution is based on a portion of a letter written by Benjamin Franklin and a speech by the Iroquois chief Canassatego in 1744. Tooker concluded that the documents only indicate that some groups of Iroquois and white settlers realized the advantages of a confederation and that ultimately there is little evidence to support the idea that eighteenth century colonists were knowledgeable regarding the Iroquois system of governance. 97  What little evidence there is regarding this system indicates chiefs of different tribes were permitted representation in the Iroquois League council and this ability to represent the tribe was hereditary. The council itself did not practice representative government and there were no elections deceased chiefs successors were selected by the most senior woman within the hereditary lineage in consultation with other women in the clan. Decision making occurred through lengthy discussion and decisions were unanimous with topics discussed being introduced by a single tribe. Tooker concludes that ...there is virtually no evidence that the framers borrowed from the Iroquois and that the myth is largely based on a claim made by Iroquois linguist and ethnographer J.N.B. Hewitt which was exaggerated and misinterpreted after his death in 1937. 97 undue weight? discuss  The Aztecs also practiced elections but the elected officials elected a supreme speaker not a ruler. 96 However a contemporary civilisation Tlaxcallan along with other Mesoamerican city states are likely to have practiced collective rule. 98  The notion of a secret ballot where one is entitled to the privacy of their votes is taken for granted by most today by virtue of the fact that it is simply considered the norm. However this practice was highly controversial in the 19th century it was widely argued that no man would want to keep his vote secret unless he was ashamed of it. citation needed  The two earliest systems used were the Victorian method and the South Australian method. Both were introduced in 1856 to voters in Victoria and South Australia. The Victorian method involved voters crossing out all the candidates whom he did not approve of. The South Australian method which is more similar to what most democracies use today had voters put a mark in the preferred candidates corresponding box. The Victorian voting system also was not completely secret as it was traceable by a special number. The end of the First World War was a temporary victory for democracy in Europe as it was preserved in France and temporarily extended to Germany. Already in 1906 full modern democratic rights universal suffrage for all citizens was implemented constitutionally in Finland as well as a proportional representation open list system. Likewise the February Revolution in Russia in 1917 inaugurated a few months of liberal democracy under Alexander Kerensky until Lenin took over in October. The terrible economic consequences of the Great Depression hurt democratic forces in many countries. The 1930s became a decade of dictators in Europe and Latin America. In 1918 the United Kingdom granted the women over 30 who met a property qualification the right to vote a second one was later passed in 1928 granting women and men equal rights. On August 18 1920 the Nineteenth Amendment Amendment XIX to the United States Constitution was adopted which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote to citizens of the United States on the basis of sex. French women got the right to vote in 1944 but did not actually cast their ballot for the first time until April 29 1945. The Indian Citizenship Act of 1924 granted full U.S. citizenship to Americas indigenous peoples called Indians in this Act. The Fourteenth Amendment guarantees citizenship to persons born in the U.S. but only if subject to the jurisdiction thereof this latter clause excludes certain indigenous peoples. The act was signed into law by President Calvin Coolidge on 2 June 1924. The act further enfranchised the rights of peoples resident within the boundaries of the United States. World War II was ultimately a victory for democracy in Western Europe where representative governments were established that reflected the general will of their citizens. However many countries of Central and Eastern Europe became undemocratic Soviet satellite states. In Southern Europe a number of rightwing authoritarian dictatorships most notably in Spain and Portugal continued to exist. Japan had moved towards democracy during the Taish period during the 1920s but it was under effective military rule in the years before and during World War II. The country adopted a new constitution during the postwar Allied occupation with initial elections in 1946. World War II also planted seeds of democracy outside Europe and Japan as it weakened with the exception of the USSR and the United States all the old colonial powers while strengthening anticolonial sentiment worldwide. Many restive coloniespossessions were promised subsequent independence in exchange for their support for embattled colonial powers during the war. In 1946 the United States granted independence to the Philippines which preserved a democratic political system as a presidential republic until the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos. The aftermath of World War II also resulted in the United Nations decision to partition the British Mandate into two states one Jewish and one Arab. On 14 May 1948 the state of Israel declared independence and thus was born the first full democracy in the Middle East. Israel is a representative democracy with a parliamentary system and universal suffrage. 122 123  India became a Democratic Republic in 1950 after achieving independence from Great Britain in 1947. After holding its first national elections in 1952 India achieved the status of the worlds largest liberal democracy with universal suffrage which it continues to hold today. Most of the former British and French colonies were independent by 1965 and at least initially democratic those that were formerly part of the British Empire often adopted the Westminster parliamentary system. 124 The process of decolonisation created much political upheaval in Africa and parts of Asia with some countries experiencing often rapid changes to and from democratic and other forms of government. In the United States of America the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and the Civil Rights Act enforced the 15th Amendment. The 24th Amendment ended poll taxing by removing all tax placed upon voting which was a technique commonly used to restrict the African American vote. The Voting Rights Act also granted voting rights to all Native Americans irrespective of their home state. The minimum voting age was reduced to 18 by the 26th Amendment in 1971. New waves of democracy swept across Southern Europe in the 1970s as a number of rightwing nationalist dictatorships fell from power. Later in Central and Eastern Europe in the late 1980s the communist states in the USSR sphere of influence were also replaced with liberal democracies. Much of Eastern Europe Latin America East and Southeast Asia and several Arab central Asian and African states and the notyetstate that is the Palestinian Authority moved towards greater liberal democracy in the 1990s and 2000s. By the end of the century the world had changed from having in 1900 not a single liberal democracy with universal suffrage to 120 of the worlds 192 nations or 62 having become such democracies. 25 nations or 13 of the worlds nations had restricted democratic practices in 1900 and in 2000 16 or 8 of the worlds nations were such restricted democracies. Other nations had and have various forms of nondemocratic rule. 125 The numbers are indicative of the expansion of democracy during the twentieth century the specifics though may be open to debate for example New Zealand enacted universal suffrage in 1893 but this is discounted due to lack of complete sovereignty of the M ori vote. The 2003 USled invasion of Iraq led to a toppling of President Saddam Hussein and a new constitution with free and open elections. 126 citation needed neutrality is disputed . Later around 2011 the Arab Spring led to much upheaval as well as to the establishing of a democracy in Tunisia and some increased democratic rights in Morocco. Egypt saw a temporary democracy when? before the reestablishment of military rule. The Palestinian Authority also took action to address democratic rights. In Africa out of 55 countries democratization seems almost stalled since 2005 because of the resistance of some 20 nondemocratic regimes most of which originated in the 1980s. 127 In exception to this in 2016 after losing an election the president of the Gambia attempted to cling to power but a threatened regional military intervention forced him to leave.In 2018 dictatorships in Sudan and Algeria fell As of 2019 update it remains unclear what type of regimes will emerge in these two countries. In Asia Myanmar also known as Burma the ruling military junta in 2011 made changes to allow certain votingrights and released a prominent figure in the National League for Democracy Aung San Suu Kyi from house arrest. Myanmar did not allow Suu Kyi to run for election. However conditions partially changed with the election of Suu Kyis National League for Democracy party and her appointment as the de facto leader of Burma Myanmar with the title state councilor as she is still not allowed to become president and therefore leads through a figurehead Htin Kyaw. Human rights however have not improved. In Bhutan in December 2005 the 4th King Jigme Singye Wangchuck announced that the first general elections would take place in 2008 and that he would abdicate the throne in favor of his eldest son. Bhutan is currently when? undergoing further changes to allow for a constitutional monarchy. In the Maldives protests and political pressure led to a government reform which allowed democratic rights and presidential elections in 2008. These were however undone by a coup in 2018.Meanwhile in Thailand military junta twice overthrew democratically elected governments 2006 and 2014 and in 2014 changed the constitution in order to increase their own power. The authoritarian regime of Hun Sen in Cambodia 128 dissolved the main opposition party Cambodia National Rescue Party in 2017 and effectively implemented a oneman dictatorship. 129  In Europe Ukraine saw several protest movements leading to a switch from effective oligarchy to more democracy as of 2019 update since the Maidan revolution of February 2014 Ukraine has seen two presidential elections and the peaceful transfer of power.Not all movement has promoted democracy however. In Poland and Hungary socalled illiberal democracies have taken hold with the ruling parties in both countries considered by the EU and by civil society to be working to undermine democratic governance. citation needed Within Englishspeaking Western democracies protectionbased attitudes combining cultural conservatism and leftist economic attitudes were the strongest predictor of support for authoritarian modes of governance. 130  Despite the number of democratic states has continued to grow since 2006 the share of weaker electoral democracies has grown significantly. This is the strongest causal factor behind fragile democracies. 132 As of 2020 authoritarianism and populism are on the rise around the world 133 with the number of people living in democracies less than the end of the Cold War. 134 Democratic backsliding in the 2010s were attributed to economic inequality and social discontent 135 personalism 136 poor management of COVID19 pandemic 137 138 as well as other factors such as government manipulation of civil society toxic polarization foreign disinformation campaigns 139 racism and nativism excessive executive power 140 141 142 and decreased power of the opposition. 143 Large parts of the world such as China Russia Central and South East Asia the Middle East and much of Africa have consolidated authoritarian rule rather seeing it weaken. Determining the continuity and age of independent democracies depends on the criteria applied but generally the United States is identified as the oldest democracy while the country with longest history of universal suffrage is New Zealand. 146  Under the influence of the theory of deliberative democracy there have been several experiments where citizens and their representatives assemble to exchange reasons. The use of random selection to form a representative deliberative body is most commonly known as citizens assembly. Citizens assemblies have been used in Canada 2004 2006 and the Netherlands 2006 to debate electoral reform and in Iceland 2009 and 2010 for broader constitutional change.,

Rule of Law USAID continues to promote the rule of law as an enduring priority of our development efforts advancing justice rights and security for all. The Rule of Law is fundamental to USAID s development mission and serves as a foundation for democracy guardrail of good governance and facilitator of inclusive economic growth. USAID believes that the basic premise of the rule of law is that no one is above the law and that the law rules through public and legitimate laws that apply to everyone. Without the rule of law autocracy corruption impunity discrimination and a host of other societal ills go unchecked and unpunished. Without the rule of law to check corruption elites gain priority access to public social goods such as healthcare or education. Without the rule of law to guard against impunity the rights and freedoms of society s most vulnerable go unprotected. Without the rule of law access to economic opportunity is available only to the connected few able to game the system. The rule of law is not just linked to but necessary for every other development goal. With the April 2023 adoption of the firstever U.S. government Rule of Law Policy USAID renewed the Agency s commitment to promoting rule of law. The Policy sets forth a new paradigm for rule of law programming known as peoplecentered justice which places the person affected by the law at the core of the policies processes and practices that constitute justice systems and services. Promoting the rule of law has long meant improving the independence accountability transparency and efficiency of justice and related institutions and now we are working to transform these institutions the services they provide and their operating systems to be more datadriven userfriendly and problem solving. Through the Rule of Law Innovation Design Experimentation Acceleration and Solutions IDEAS Lab USAID also provides a provides a collaborative space to share knowledge generate data develop cuttingedge tools and ideate gamechanging and innovative approaches to strengthen the rule of law and promote peoplecentered justice. Examples of USAID rule of law programming can be found in the Rule of Law Achievements Report 20052020 that highlights achievements based on an analysis of 340 activities in 83 countries and focusing on activities in 16 countries. These lessons help USAID to reenvision rule of law programming to meet contemporary challenges particularly the critical links with other areas of development such as global health climate change economic development gender equality and labor rights.  BodyBuilding upon USAIDs decadeslong effort to promote the rule of law and ensure justice rights and security for all the Rule of Law Policy reelevates the rule of law within our development mission equips and empowers staff who promote it and leverages our comparative advantages to sustain it. Ghana USAID assistance enabled the Ghanaian judiciary to gain greater control over its funding and to continue to regularly advocate for increased resource allocations. Judicial officers now justify and defend allocations before the relevant parliamentary committees. Also the judiciary continues to increase its ability to conduct judicial review and legislative oversight engaging with the Parliament and the Ghana Audit Service.  BodyThe IDEAS Lab is the USAID Rule of Law Policy s primary implementation vehicle South Africa USAID s support empowered sexual and genderbased violence SGBV victims including programs for child witness preparation and raised public awareness across the country through education campaigns in schools. USAID strengthened civil society s capacity to oversee court processes and judicial decisions on SGBV and supported the development of a uniform information reporting and record keeping system for nongovernmental organizations to support advocacy for victims and improve government response. View USAID personnel from around the world share how they are reimagining rule of law and people centered justice. Colombia USAID was instrumental in Colombia s efforts to establish a new adversarial criminal justice system. A new criminal procedure code in 2002 and a series of other laws enacted during 20052020 have helped to make the administration of criminal justice more efficient transparent and equitable. USAID technical assistance helped Colombia implement new systems modernize justice institutions and expand reform from the national to subnational departmental and municipal levels. Indonesia USAID supported the Indonesian Supreme Court s Long Blueprint a strategy for administrative and transparencyrelated reforms across the judiciary. Capitalizing on local knowledge and expertise USAID supported the development of a series of Indonesianled strategic plans to improve the AntiCorruption Court the Commercial Court and the Supreme Court. The Blueprint process used data from the Central Statistics Agency to strengthen judicial career paths. Judiciary leaders developed standards for digital information dissemination and today judges demonstrate greater commitment to transparency regularly posting decisions and other court data online. Georgia USAID has supported civic organizations and legal professional institutions to build community awareness of and trust in the justice system. A core focus has been ensuring courts are responsive to the legal needs of the community providing a peoplecentered justice approach. By partnering with courts and legal professionals USAID has supported efforts to expand courtcommunity engagement practices using examples from around the world.,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy, List of forms of government Democracy from Ancient Greek romanized d mokrat a d mos people and kratos rule 1 is a system of government in which state power is vested in the people or the general population of a state. 2 Under a minimalist definition of democracy rulers are elected through competitive elections while more expansive definitions link democracy to guarantees of civil liberties and human rights in addition to competitive elections. 3 4  In a direct democracy the people have the direct authority to deliberate and decide legislation. In a representative democracy the people choose governing officials through elections to do so. Who is considered part of the people and how authority is shared among or delegated by the people has changed over time and at different rates in different countries. Features of democracy oftentimes include freedom of assembly association personal property freedom of religion and speech citizenship consent of the governed voting rights freedom from unwarranted governmental deprivation of the right to life and liberty and minority rights. The notion of democracy has evolved over time considerably. Throughout history one can find evidence of direct democracy in which communities make decisions through popular assembly. Today the dominant form of democracy is representative democracy where citizens elect government officials to govern on their behalf such as in a parliamentary or presidential democracy. Most democracies apply in most cases majority rule 5 6 but in some cases plurality rule supermajority rule e.g. constitution or consensus rule e.g. Switzerland are applied. They serve the crucial purpose of inclusiveness and broader legitimacy on sensitive issues counterbalancing majoritarianism and therefore mostly take precedence on a constitutional level. In the common variant of liberal democracy the powers of the majority are exercised within the framework of a representative democracy but a constitution and supreme court limit the majority and protect the minority usually through securing the enjoyment by all of certain individual rights such as freedom of speech or freedom of association. 7 8  The term appeared in the 5th century BC in Greek citystates notably Classical Athens to mean rule of the people in contrast to aristocracy aristokrat a meaning rule of an elite. 9 Western democracy as distinct from that which existed in antiquity is generally considered to have originated in citystates such as those in Classical Athens and the Roman Republic where various degrees of enfranchisement of the free male population were observed. In virtually all democratic governments throughout ancient and modern history democratic citizenship was initially restricted to an elite class which was later extended to all adult citizens. In most modern democracies this was achieved through the suffrage movements of the 19th and 20th centuries. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is not vested in the general population of a state such as authoritarian systems. World public opinion strongly favors democratic systems of government. 10 According to the VDem Democracy indices and The Economist Democracy Index less than half the worlds population lives in a democracy as of 2022 update . 11 12  Although democracy is generally understood to be defined by voting 1 8 no consensus exists on a precise definition of democracy. 13 Karl Popper says that the classical view of democracy is in brief the theory that democracy is the rule of the people and that the people have a right to rule. 14 One study identified 2234 adjectives used to describe democracy in the English language. 15  Democratic principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. 16 For example in a representative democracy every vote has in theory equal weight and the freedom of eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights and liberties which are typically enshrined in a constitution 17 18 while other uses of democracy may encompass direct democracy in which citizens vote on issues directly. According to the United Nations democracy provides an environment that respects human rights and fundamental freedoms and in which the freely expressed will of people is exercised. 19  One theory holds that democracy requires three fundamental principles upward control sovereignty residing at the lowest levels of authority political equality and social norms by which individuals and institutions only consider acceptable acts that reflect the first two principles of upward control and political equality. 20 Legal equality political freedom and rule of law 21 are often identified by commentators as foundational characteristics for a wellfunctioning democracy. 13  In some countries notably in the United Kingdom which originated the Westminster system the dominant principle is that of parliamentary sovereignty while maintaining judicial independence. 22 23 In India parliamentary sovereignty is subject to the Constitution of India which includes judicial review. 24 Though the term democracy is typically used in the context of a political state the principles also are potentially applicable to private organisations such as clubs societies and firms. Democracies may use many different decisionmaking methods but majority rule is the dominant form. Without compensation like legal protections of individual or group rights political minorities can be oppressed by the tyranny of the majority. Majority rule involves a competitive approach opposed to consensus democracy creating the need that elections and generally deliberation be substantively and procedurally fair i.e. just and equitable. In some countries freedom of political expression freedom of speech and freedom of the press are considered important to ensure that voters are well informed enabling them to vote according to their own interests and beliefs. 25 26  It has also been suggested that a basic feature of democracy is the capacity of all voters to participate freely and fully in the life of their society. 27 With its emphasis on notions of social contract and the collective will of all the voters democracy can also be characterised as a form of political collectivism because it is defined as a form of government in which all eligible citizens have an equal say in lawmaking. 28  Republics though often popularly associated with democracy because of the shared principle of rule by consent of the governed are not necessarily democracies as republicanism does not specify how the people are to rule. 29 Classically the term republic encompassed both democracies and aristocracies. 30 31 In a modern sense the republican form of government is a form of government without a monarch. Because of this democracies can be republics or constitutional monarchies such as the United Kingdom. Democratic assemblies are as old as the human species and are found throughout human history 33 but up until the nineteenth century major political figures have largely opposed democracy. 34 Republican theorists linked democracy to small size as political units grew in size the likelihood increased that the government would turn despotic. 35 36 At the same time small political units were vulnerable to conquest. 35 Montesquieu wrote If a republic be small it is destroyed by a foreign force if it be large it is ruined by an internal imperfection. 37 According to Johns Hopkins University political scientist Daniel Deudney the creation of the United States with its large size and its system of checks and balances was a solution to the dual problems of size. 35 pages needed  Retrospectively different polities outside of declared democracies have been described as protodemocratic. Forms of democracy occurred organically in societies around the world that had no contact with each other. 38 39  Vaishali capital city of the Vajjika League Vrijji mahajanapada of India is considered one of the first examples of a republic around the 6th century BC. 40 41 42  The term democracy first appeared in ancient Greek political and philosophical thought in the citystate of Athens during classical antiquity. 43 44 The word comes from d mos common people and kr tos forcemight. 45 Under Cleisthenes what is generally held as the first example of a type of democracy in 508 507 BC was established in Athens. Cleisthenes is referred to as the father of Athenian democracy. 46 The first attested use of the word democracy is found in prose works of the 430s BC such as Herodotus Histories but its usage was older by several decades as two Athenians born in the 470s were named Democrates a new political name likely in support of democracy given at a time of debates over constitutional issues in Athens. Aeschylus also strongly alludes to the word in his play The Suppliants staged in c.463 BC where he mentions the demoss ruling hand demou kratousa cheir. Before that time the word used to define the new political system of Cleisthenes was probably isonomia meaning political equality. 47  Athenian democracy took the form of a direct democracy and it had two distinguishing features the random selection of ordinary citizens to fill the few existing government administrative and judicial offices 48 and a legislative assembly consisting of all Athenian citizens. 49 All eligible citizens were allowed to speak and vote in the assembly which set the laws of the city state. However Athenian citizenship excluded women slaves foreigners m toikoi and youths below the age of military service. 50 51 contradictory Effectively only 1 in 4 residents in Athens qualified as citizens. Owning land was not a requirement for citizenship. 52 The exclusion of large parts of the population from the citizen body is closely related to the ancient understanding of citizenship. In most of antiquity the benefit of citizenship was tied to the obligation to fight war campaigns. 53  Athenian democracy was not only direct in the sense that decisions were made by the assembled people but also the most direct in the sense that the people through the assembly boule and courts of law controlled the entire political process and a large proportion of citizens were involved constantly in the public business. 54 Even though the rights of the individual were not secured by the Athenian constitution in the modern sense the ancient Greeks had no word for rights 55 those who were citizens of Athens enjoyed their liberties not in opposition to the government but by living in a city that was not subject to another power and by not being subjects themselves to the rule of another person. 56  Range voting appeared in Sparta as early as 700 BC. The Spartan ecclesia was an assembly of the people held once a month in which every male citizen of at least 20 years of age could participate. In the assembly Spartans elected leaders and cast votes by range voting and shouting the vote is then decided on how loudly the crowd shouts. Aristotle called this childish as compared with the stone voting ballots used by the Athenian citizenry. Sparta adopted it because of its simplicity and to prevent any biased voting buying or cheating that was predominant in the early democratic elections. 57  Even though the Roman Republic contributed significantly to many aspects of democracy only a minority of Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of weighted voting so most high officials including members of the Senate came from a few wealthy and noble families. 58 In addition the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom was the first case in the Western world of a polity being formed with the explicit purpose of being a republic although it didnt have much of a democracy. The Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries. 59  Other cultures such as the Iroquois Nation in the Americas also developed a form of democratic society between 1450 and 1660 and possibly in 1142 60 well before contact with the Europeans. This democracy continues to the present day and is the worlds oldest standing representative democracy. 61 62  While most regions in Europe during the Middle Ages were ruled by clergy or feudal lords there existed various systems involving elections or assemblies although often only involving a small part of the population. In Scandinavia bodies known as things consisted of freemen presided by a lawspeaker. These deliberative bodies were responsible for settling political questions and variants included the Althing in Iceland and the L gting in the Faeroe Islands. 63 64 The veche found in Eastern Europe was a similar body to the Scandinavian thing. In the Roman Catholic Church the pope has been elected by a papal conclave composed of cardinals since 1059. The first documented parliamentary body in Europe was the Cortes of Le n. Established by Alfonso IX in 1188 the Cortes had authority over setting taxation foreign affairs and legislating though the exact nature of its role remains disputed. 65 The Republic of Ragusa established in 1358 and centered around the city of Dubrovnik provided representation and voting rights to its male aristocracy only. Various Italian citystates and polities had republic forms of government. For instance the Republic of Florence established in 1115 was led by the Signoria whose members were chosen by sortition. In 10th 15th century Frisia a distinctly nonfeudal society the right to vote on local matters and on county officials was based on land size. The Kouroukan Fouga divided the Mali Empire into ruling clans lineages that were represented at a great assembly called the Gbara. However the charter made Mali more similar to a constitutional monarchy than a democratic republic. The Parliament of England had its roots in the restrictions on the power of kings written into Magna Carta 1215 which explicitly protected certain rights of the Kings subjects and implicitly supported what became the English writ of habeas corpus safeguarding individual freedom against unlawful imprisonment with right to appeal. 66 67 The first representative national assembly in England was Simon de Montforts Parliament in 1265. 68 69 The emergence of petitioning is some of the earliest evidence of parliament being used as a forum to address the general grievances of ordinary people. However the power to call parliament remained at the pleasure of the monarch. 70  Studies have linked the emergence of parliamentary institutions in Europe during the medieval period to urban agglomeration and the creation of new classes such as artisans 71 as well as the presence of nobility and religious elites. 72 Scholars have also linked the emergence of representative government to Europes relative political fragmentation. 73 Political scientist David Stasavage links the fragmentation of Europe and its subsequent democratization to the manner in which the Roman Empire collapsed Roman territory was conquered by small fragmented groups of Germanic tribes thus leading to the creation of small political units where rulers were relatively weak and needed the consent of the governed to ward off foreign threats. 74  In Poland noble democracy was characterized by an increase in the activity of the middle nobility which wanted to increase their share in exercising power at the expense of the magnates. Magnates dominated the most important offices in the state secular and ecclesiastical and sat on the royal council later the senate. The growing importance of the middle nobility had an impact on the establishment of the institution of the land sejmik local assembly which subsequently obtained more rights. During the fifteenth and first half of the sixteenth century sejmiks received more and more powers and became the most important institutions of local power. In 1454 Casimir IV Jagiellon granted the sejmiks the right to decide on taxes and to convene a mass mobilization in the Nieszawa Statutes. He also pledged not to create new laws without their consent. 75  In 17th century England there was renewed interest in Magna Carta. 76 The Parliament of England passed the Petition of Right in 1628 which established certain liberties for subjects. The English Civil War 1642 1651 was fought between the King and an oligarchic but elected Parliament 77 78 during which the idea of a political party took form with groups debating rights to political representation during the Putney Debates of 1647. 79 Subsequently the Protectorate 1653 59 and the English Restoration 1660 restored more autocratic rule although Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act in 1679 which strengthened the convention that forbade detention lacking sufficient cause or evidence. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688 the Bill of Rights was enacted in 1689 which codified certain rights and liberties and is still in effect. The Bill set out the requirement for regular elections rules for freedom of speech in Parliament and limited the power of the monarch ensuring that unlike much of Europe at the time royal absolutism would not prevail. 80 81 Economic historians Douglass North and Barry Weingast have characterized the institutions implemented in the Glorious Revolution as a resounding success in terms of restraining the government and ensuring protection for property rights. 82  Renewed interest in the Magna Carta the English Civil War and the Glorious Revolution in the 17th century prompted the growth of political philosophy on the British Isles. Thomas Hobbes was the first philosopher to articulate a detailed social contract theory. Writing in the Leviathan 1651 Hobbes theorized that individuals living in the state of nature led lives that were solitary poor nasty brutish and short and constantly waged a war of all against all. In order to prevent the occurrence of an anarchic state of nature Hobbes reasoned that individuals ceded their rights to a strong authoritarian power. In other words Hobbes advocated for an absolute monarchy which in his opinion was the best form of government. Later philosopher and physician John Locke would posit a different interpretation of social contract theory. Writing in his Two Treatises of Government 1689 Locke posited that all individuals possessed the inalienable rights to life liberty and estate property. 83 According to Locke individuals would voluntarily come together to form a state for the purposes of defending their rights. Particularly important for Locke were property rights whose protection Locke deemed to be a governments primary purpose. 84 Furthermore Locke asserted that governments were legitimate only if they held the consent of the governed. For Locke citizens had the right to revolt against a government that acted against their interest or became tyrannical. Although they were not widely read during his lifetime Lockes works are considered the founding documents of liberal thought and profoundly influenced the leaders of the American Revolution and later the French Revolution. 85 His liberal democratic framework of governance remains the preeminent form of democracy in the world. In the Cossack republics of Ukraine in the 16th and 17th centuries the Cossack Hetmanate and Zaporizhian Sich the holder of the highest post of Hetman was elected by the representatives from the countrys districts. In North America representative government began in Jamestown Virginia with the election of the House of Burgesses forerunner of the Virginia General Assembly in 1619. English Puritans who migrated from 1620 established colonies in New England whose local governance was democratic 86 although these local assemblies had some small amounts of devolved power the ultimate authority was held by the Crown and the English Parliament. The Puritans Pilgrim Fathers Baptists and Quakers who founded these colonies applied the democratic organisation of their congregations also to the administration of their communities in worldly matters. 87 88 89  The first Parliament of Great Britain was established in 1707 after the merger of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland under the Acts of Union. Two key documents of the UKs uncodified constitution the English Declaration of Right 1689 restated in the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Scottish Claim of Right 1689 had both cemented Parliaments position as the supreme lawmaking body and said that the election of members of Parliament ought to be free. 91 However Parliament was only elected by male property owners which amounted to 3 of the population in 1780. 92 The first known British person of African heritage to vote in a general election Ignatius Sancho voted in 1774 and 1780. 93  During the Age of Liberty in Sweden 1718 1772 civil rights were expanded and power shifted from the monarch to parliament. 94 The taxed peasantry was represented in parliament although with little influence but commoners without taxed property had no suffrage. The creation of the shortlived Corsican Republic in 1755 was an early attempt to adopt a democratic constitution all men and women above age of 25 could vote. 95 This Corsican Constitution was the first based on Enlightenment principles and included female suffrage something that was not included in most other democracies until the 20th century. Colonial America had similar property qualifications as Britain and in the period before 1776 the abundance and availability of land meant that large numbers of colonists met such requirements with at least 60 per cent of adult white males able to vote. 96 The great majority of white men were farmers who met the property ownership or taxpaying requirements. With few exceptions no blacks or women could vote. Vermont which on declaring independence of Great Britain in 1777 adopted a constitution modelled on Pennsylvanias with citizenship and democratic suffrage for males with or without property. 97 The United States Constitution of 1787 is the oldest surviving still active governmental codified constitution. The Constitution provided for an elected government and protected civil rights and liberties but did not end slavery nor extend voting rights in the United States instead leaving the issue of suffrage to the individual states. 98 Generally states limited suffrage to white male property owners and taxpayers. 99 At the time of the first Presidential election in 1789 about 6 of the population was eligible to vote. 100 The Naturalization Act of 1790 limited U.S. citizenship to whites only. 101 The Bill of Rights in 1791 set limits on government power to protect personal freedoms but had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 130 years after ratification. 102  In 1789 Revolutionary France adopted the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen and although shortlived the National Convention was elected by all men in 1792. 103 The PolishLithuanian Constitution of 3 May 1791 sought to implement a more effective constitutional monarchy introduced political equality between townspeople and nobility and placed the peasants under the protection of the government mitigating the worst abuses of serfdom. In force for less than 19 months it was declared null and void by the Grodno Sejm that met in 1793. 104 105 Nonetheless the 1791 Constitution helped keep alive Polish aspirations for the eventual restoration of the countrys sovereignty over a century later. In the United States the 1828 presidential election was the first in which nonpropertyholding white males could vote in the vast majority of states. Voter turnout soared during the 1830s reaching about 80 of the adult white male population in the 1840 presidential election. 106 North Carolina was the last state to abolish property qualification in 1856 resulting in a close approximation to universal white male suffrage however taxpaying requirements remained in five states in 1860 and survived in two states until the 20th century. 107 108 109 In the 1860 United States Census the slave population had grown to four million 110 and in Reconstruction after the Civil War three constitutional amendments were passed the 13th Amendment 1865 that ended slavery the 14th Amendment 1869 that gave black people citizenship and the 15th Amendment 1870 that gave black males a nominal right to vote. 111 112 nb 1 Full enfranchisement of citizens was not secured until after the civil rights movement gained passage by the US Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 113 114  The voting franchise in the United Kingdom was expanded and made more uniform in a series of reforms that began with the Reform Act 1832 and continued into the 20th century notably with the Representation of the People Act 1918 and the Equal Franchise Act 1928. Universal male suffrage was established in France in March 1848 in the wake of the French Revolution of 1848. 115 During that year several revolutions broke out in Europe as rulers were confronted with popular demands for liberal constitutions and more democratic government. 116  In 1876 the Ottoman Empire transitioned from an absolute monarchy to a constitutional one and held two elections the next year to elect members to her newly formed parliament. 117 Provisional Electoral Regulations were issued stating that the elected members of the Provincial Administrative Councils would elect members to the first Parliament. Later that year a new constitution was promulgated which provided for a bicameral Parliament with a Senate appointed by the Sultan and a popularly elected Chamber of Deputies. Only men above the age of 30 who were competent in Turkish and had full civil rights were allowed to stand for election. Reasons for disqualification included holding dual citizenship being employed by a foreign government being bankrupt employed as a servant or having notoriety for ill deeds. Full universal suffrage was achieved in 1934. 118  In 1893 the selfgoverning colony New Zealand became the first country in the world except for the shortlived 18thcentury Corsican Republic to establish active universal suffrage by recognizing women as having the right to vote. 119  20thcentury transitions to liberal democracy have come in successive waves of democracy variously resulting from wars revolutions decolonisation and religious and economic circumstances. 120 Global waves of democratic regression reversing democratization have also occurred in the 1920s and 30s in the 1960s and 1970s and in the 2010s. 121 122  World War I and the dissolution of the autocratic Ottoman and AustroHungarian empires resulted in the creation of new nationstates in Europe most of them at least nominally democratic. In the 1920s democratic movements flourished and womens suffrage advanced but the Great Depression brought disenchantment and most of the countries of Europe Latin America and Asia turned to strongman rule or dictatorships. Fascism and dictatorships flourished in Nazi Germany Italy Spain and Portugal as well as nondemocratic governments in the Baltics the Balkans Brazil Cuba China and Japan among others. 123  World War II brought a definitive reversal of this trend in western Europe. The democratisation of the American British and French sectors of occupied Germany disputed 124 Austria Italy and the occupied Japan served as a model for the later theory of government change. However most of Eastern Europe including the Soviet sector of Germany fell into the nondemocratic Sovietdominated bloc. The war was followed by decolonisation and again most of the new independent states had nominally democratic constitutions. India emerged as the worlds largest democracy and continues to be so. 125 Countries that were once part of the British Empire often adopted the British Westminster system. 126 127 By 1960 the vast majority of countrystates were nominally democracies although most of the worlds populations lived in nominal democracies that experienced sham elections and other forms of subterfuge particularly in Communist states and the former colonies. A subsequent wave of democratisation brought substantial gains toward true liberal democracy for many states dubbed third wave of democracy. Portugal Spain and several of the military dictatorships in South America returned to civilian rule in the 1970s and 1980s. nb 2 This was followed by countries in East and South Asia by the midtolate 1980s. Economic malaise in the 1980s along with resentment of Soviet oppression contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union the associated end of the Cold War and the democratisation and liberalisation of the former Eastern bloc countries. The most successful of the new democracies were those geographically and culturally closest to western Europe and they are now either part of the European Union or candidate states. In 1986 after the toppling of the most prominent Asian dictatorship the only democratic state of its kind at the time emerged in the Philippines with the rise of Corazon Aquino who would later be known as the Mother of Asian Democracy. The liberal trend spread to some states in Africa in the 1990s most prominently in South Africa. Some recent examples of attempts of liberalisation include the Indonesian Revolution of 1998 the Bulldozer Revolution in Yugoslavia the Rose Revolution in Georgia the Orange Revolution in Ukraine the Cedar Revolution in Lebanon the Tulip Revolution in Kyrgyzstan and the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia. According to Freedom House in 2007 there were 123 electoral democracies up from 40 in 1972. 129 According to World Forum on Democracy electoral democracies now represent 120 of the 192 existing countries and constitute 58.2 per cent of the worlds population. At the same time liberal democracies i.e. countries Freedom House regards as free and respectful of basic human rights and the rule of law are 85 in number and represent 38 per cent of the global population. 130 Also in 2007 the United Nations declared 15 September the International Day of Democracy. 131  Many countries reduced their voting age to 18 years the major democracies began to do so in the 1970s starting in Western Europe and North America. 132 failed verification 133 134 Most electoral democracies continue to exclude those younger than 18 from voting. 135 The voting age has been lowered to 16 for national elections in a number of countries including Brazil Austria Cuba and Nicaragua. In California a 2004 proposal to permit a quarter vote at 14 and a half vote at 16 was ultimately defeated. In 2008 the German parliament proposed but shelved a bill that would grant the vote to each citizen at birth to be used by a parent until the child claims it for themselves. According to Freedom House starting in 2005 there have been 17 consecutive years in which declines in political rights and civil liberties throughout the world have outnumbered improvements 136 137 as populist and nationalist political forces have gained ground everywhere from Poland under the Law and Justice Party to the Philippines under Rodrigo Duterte. 136 121 In a Freedom House report released in 2018 Democracy Scores for most countries declined for the 12th consecutive year. 138 The Christian Science Monitor reported that nationalist and populist political ideologies were gaining ground at the expense of rule of law in countries like Poland Turkey and Hungary. For example in Poland the President appointed 27 new Supreme Court judges over legal objections from the European Commission. In Turkey thousands of judges were removed from their positions following a failed coup attempt during a government crackdown . 139  Democratic backsliding in the 2010s were attributed to economic inequality and social discontent 141 personalism 142 poor governments management of the COVID19 pandemic 143 144 as well as other factors such as manipulation of civil society toxic polarization foreign disinformation campaigns 145 racism and nativism excessive executive power 146 147 148 and decreased power of the opposition. 149 Within Englishspeaking Western democracies protectionbased attitudes combining cultural conservatism and leftist economic attitudes were the strongest predictor of support for authoritarian modes of governance. 150  Aristotle contrasted rule by the many democracytimocracy with rule by the few oligarchyaristocracy and with rule by a single person tyranny or today autocracyabsolute monarchy. He also thought that there was a good and a bad variant of each system he considered democracy to be the degenerate counterpart to timocracy. 151 152  A common view among early and renaissance Republican theorists was that democracy could only survive in small political communities. 153 Heeding the lessons of the Roman Republics shift to monarchism as it grew larger or smaller these Republican theorists held that the expansion of territory and population inevitably led to tyranny. 153 Democracy was therefore highly fragile and rare historically as it could only survive in small political units which due to their size were vulnerable to conquest by larger political units. 153 Montesquieu famously said if a republic is small it is destroyed by an outside force if it is large it is destroyed by an internal vice. 153 Rousseau asserted It is therefore the natural property of small states to be governed as a republic of middling ones to be subject to a monarch and of large empires to be swayed by a despotic prince. 153  Among modern political theorists there are three contending conceptions of democracy aggregative democracy deliberative democracy and radical democracy. 154  The theory of aggregative democracy claims that the aim of the democratic processes is to solicit citizens preferences and aggregate them together to determine what social policies society should adopt. Therefore proponents of this view hold that democratic participation should primarily focus on voting where the policy with the most votes gets implemented. Different variants of aggregative democracy exist. Under minimalism democracy is a system of government in which citizens have given teams of political leaders the right to rule in periodic elections. According to this minimalist conception citizens cannot and should not rule because for example on most issues most of the time they have no clear views or their views are not wellfounded. Joseph Schumpeter articulated this view most famously in his book Capitalism Socialism and Democracy. 155 Contemporary proponents of minimalism include William H. Riker Adam Przeworski Richard Posner. According to the theory of direct democracy on the other hand citizens should vote directly not through their representatives on legislative proposals. Proponents of direct democracy offer varied reasons to support this view. Political activity can be valuable in itself it socialises and educates citizens and popular participation can check powerful elites. Most importantly citizens do not rule themselves unless they directly decide laws and policies. Governments will tend to produce laws and policies that are close to the views of the median voter with half to their left and the other half to their right. This is not a desirable outcome as it represents the action of selfinterested and somewhat unaccountable political elites competing for votes. Anthony Downs suggests that ideological political parties are necessary to act as a mediating broker between individual and governments. Downs laid out this view in his 1957 book An Economic Theory of Democracy. 156  Robert A. Dahl argues that the fundamental democratic principle is that when it comes to binding collective decisions each person in a political community is entitled to have hisher interests be given equal consideration not necessarily that all people are equally satisfied by the collective decision. He uses the term polyarchy to refer to societies in which there exists a certain set of institutions and procedures which are perceived as leading to such democracy. First and foremost among these institutions is the regular occurrence of free and open elections which are used to select representatives who then manage all or most of the public policy of the society. However these polyarchic procedures may not create a full democracy if for example poverty prevents political participation. 157 Similarly Ronald Dworkin argues that democracy is a substantive not a merely procedural ideal. 158  Deliberative democracy is based on the notion that democracy is government by deliberation. Unlike aggregative democracy deliberative democracy holds that for a democratic decision to be legitimate it must be preceded by authentic deliberation not merely the aggregation of preferences that occurs in voting. Authentic deliberation is deliberation among decisionmakers that is free from distortions of unequal political power such as power a decisionmaker obtained through economic wealth or the support of interest groups. 159 160 161 If the decisionmakers cannot reach consensus after authentically deliberating on a proposal then they vote on the proposal using a form of majority rule. Citizens assemblies are considered by many scholars as practical examples of deliberative democracy 162 163 164 with a recent OECD report identifying citizens assemblies as an increasingly popular mechanism to involve citizens in governmental decisionmaking. 165  Radical democracy is based on the idea that there are hierarchical and oppressive power relations that exist in society. Democracys role is to make visible and challenge those relations by allowing for difference dissent and antagonisms in decisionmaking processes.  Democracy indices are quantitative and comparative assessments of the state of democracy 166 for different countries according to various definitions of democracy. 167  The democracies indices differ in whether they are categorical such as classifying countries into democracies hybrid regimes and autocracies 168 169 or continuous values. 170 The qualitative nature of democracy indices enables data analytical approaches for studying causal mechanisms of regime transformation processes. Democracy has taken a number of forms both in theory and practice. Some varieties of democracy provide better representation and more freedom for their citizens than others. 179 180 However if any democracy is not structured to prohibit the government from excluding the people from the legislative process or any branch of government from altering the separation of powers in its favour then a branch of the system can accumulate too much power and destroy the democracy. 181 182 183  The following kinds of democracy are not exclusive of one another many specify details of aspects that are independent of one another and can coexist in a single system. Several variants of democracy exist but there are two basic forms both of which concern how the whole body of all eligible citizens executes its will. One form of democracy is direct democracy in which all eligible citizens have active participation in the political decision making for example voting on policy initiatives directly. 184 In most modern democracies the whole body of eligible citizens remain the sovereign power but political power is exercised indirectly through elected representatives this is called a representative democracy. Direct democracy is a political system where the citizens participate in the decisionmaking personally contrary to relying on intermediaries or representatives. A direct democracy gives the voting population the power to Within modernday representative governments certain electoral tools like referendums citizens initiatives and recall elections are referred to as forms of direct democracy. 185 However some advocates of direct democracy argue for local assemblies of facetoface discussion. Direct democracy as a government system currently exists in the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Glarus 186 the Rebel Zapatista Autonomous Municipalities 187 communities affiliated with the CIPORFM 188 the Bolivian city councils of FEJUVE 189 and Kurdish cantons of Rojava. 190  Some modern democracies that are predominantly representative in nature also heavily rely upon forms of political action that are directly democratic. These democracies which combine elements of representative democracy and direct democracy are termed semidirect democracies or participatory democracies. Examples include Switzerland and some U.S. states where frequent use is made of referendums and initiatives. The Swiss confederation is a semidirect democracy. 186 At the federal level citizens can propose changes to the constitution federal popular initiative or ask for a referendum to be held on any law voted by the parliament. 186 Between January 1995 and June 2005 Swiss citizens voted 31 times to answer 103 questions during the same period French citizens participated in only two referendums. 186 Although in the past 120 years less than 250 initiatives have been put to referendum. 191  Examples include the extensive use of referendums in the US state of California which is a state that has more than 20 million voters. 192  In New England town meetings are often used especially in rural areas to manage local government. This creates a hybrid form of government with a local direct democracy and a representative state government. For example most Vermont towns hold annual town meetings in March in which town officers are elected budgets for the town and schools are voted on and citizens have the opportunity to speak and be heard on political matters. 193  The use of a lot system a characteristic of Athenian democracy is a feature of some versions of direct democracies. In this system important governmental and administrative tasks are performed by citizens picked from a lottery. 194  Representative democracy involves the election of government officials by the people being represented. If the head of state is also democratically elected then it is called a democratic republic. 195 The most common mechanisms involve election of the candidate with a majority or a plurality of the votes. Most western countries have representative systems. 186  Representatives may be elected or become diplomatic representatives by a particular district or constituency or represent the entire electorate through proportional systems with some using a combination of the two. Some representative democracies also incorporate elements of direct democracy such as referendums. 196 A characteristic of representative democracy is that while the representatives are elected by the people to act in the peoples interest they retain the freedom to exercise their own judgement as how best to do so. Such reasons have driven criticism upon representative democracy 197 198 pointing out the contradictions of representation mechanisms with democracy 199 200  Parliamentary democracy is a representative democracy where government is appointed by or can be dismissed by representatives as opposed to a presidential rule wherein the president is both head of state and the head of government and is elected by the voters. Under a parliamentary democracy government is exercised by delegation to an executive ministry and subject to ongoing review checks and balances by the legislative parliament elected by the people. 201 202 203 204  In a parliamentary system the Prime Minister may be dismissed by the legislature at any point in time for not meeting the expectations of the legislature. This is done through a Vote of No Confidence where the legislature decides whether or not to remove the Prime Minister from office with majority support for dismissal. 205 In some countries the Prime Minister can also call an election at any point in time typically when the Prime Minister believes that they are in good favour with the public as to get reelected. In other parliamentary democracies extra elections are virtually never held a minority government being preferred until the next ordinary elections. An important feature of the parliamentary democracy is the concept of the loyal opposition. The essence of the concept is that the second largest political party or opposition opposes the governing party or coalition while still remaining loyal to the state and its democratic principles. Presidential Democracy is a system where the public elects the president through an election. The president serves as both the head of state and head of government controlling most of the executive powers. The president serves for a specific term and cannot exceed that amount of time. The legislature often has limited ability to remove a president from office. Elections typically have a fixed date and arent easily changed. The president has direct control over the cabinet specifically appointing the cabinet members. 205  The executive usually has the responsibility to execute or implement legislation and may have the limited legislative powers such as a veto. However a legislative branch passes legislation and budgets. This provides some measure of separation of powers. In consequence however the president and the legislature may end up in the control of separate parties allowing one to block the other and thereby interfere with the orderly operation of the state. This may be the reason why presidential democracy is not very common outside the Americas Africa and Central and Southeast Asia. 205  A semipresidential system is a system of democracy in which the government includes both a prime minister and a president. The particular powers held by the prime minister and president vary by country. 205  Many countries such as the United Kingdom Spain the Netherlands Belgium Scandinavian countries Thailand Japan and Bhutan turned powerful monarchs into constitutional monarchs often gradually with limited or symbolic roles. For example in the predecessor states to the United Kingdom constitutional monarchy began to emerge and has continued uninterrupted since the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and passage of the Bill of Rights 1689. 22 80 Strongly limited constitutional monarchies such as the United Kingdom have been referred to as crowned republics by writers such as H. G. Wells. 206  In other countries the monarchy was abolished along with the aristocratic system as in France China Russia Germany Austria Hungary Italy Greece and Egypt. An elected person with or without significant powers became the head of state in these countries. Elite upper houses of legislatures which often had lifetime or hereditary tenure were common in many states. Over time these either had their powers limited as with the British House of Lords or else became elective and remained powerful as with the Australian Senate. The term republic has many different meanings but today often refers to a representative democracy with an elected head of state such as a president serving for a limited term in contrast to states with a hereditary monarch as a head of state even if these states also are representative democracies with an elected or appointed head of government such as a prime minister. 207  The Founding Fathers of the United States often criticised direct democracy which in their view often came without the protection of a constitution enshrining inalienable rights James Madison argued especially in The Federalist No. 10 that what distinguished a direct democracy from a republic was that the former became weaker as it got larger and suffered more violently from the effects of faction whereas a republic could get stronger as it got larger and combats faction by its very structure. 208  Professors Richard Ellis of Willamette University and Michael Nelson of Rhodes College argue that much constitutional thought from Madison to Lincoln and beyond has focused on the problem of majority tyranny. They conclude The principles of republican government embedded in the Constitution represent an effort by the framers to ensure that the inalienable rights of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness would not be trampled by majorities. 209 What was critical to American values John Adams insisted 210 was that the government be bound by fixed laws which the people have a voice in making and a right to defend. As Benjamin Franklin was exiting after writing the U.S. constitution Elizabeth Willing Powel 211 asked him Well Doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy?. He replied A republic if you can keep it. 212  A liberal democracy is a representative democracy in which the ability of the elected representatives to exercise decisionmaking power is subject to the rule of law and moderated by a constitution or laws that emphasise the protection of the rights and freedoms of individuals and which places constraints on the leaders and on the extent to which the will of the majority can be exercised against the rights of minorities see civil liberties. In a liberal democracy it is possible for some largescale decisions to emerge from the many individual decisions that citizens are free to make. In other words citizens can vote with their feet or vote with their dollars resulting in significant informal governmentbythemasses that exercises many powers associated with formal government elsewhere. Socialist thought has several different views on democracy. Social democracy democratic socialism and the dictatorship of the proletariat are some examples. Many democratic socialists and social democrats believe in a form of participatory industrial economic andor workplace democracy combined with a representative democracy. Within Marxist orthodoxy there is a hostility to what is commonly called liberal democracy which is referred to as parliamentary democracy because of its centralised nature. Because of orthodox Marxists desire to eliminate the political elitism they see in capitalism Marxists Leninists and Trotskyists believe in direct democracy implemented through a system of communes which are sometimes called soviets. This system can begin with workplace democracy and ultimately manifests itself as council democracy. Anarchists are split in this domain depending on whether they believe that a majorityrule is tyrannic or not. To many anarchists the only form of democracy considered acceptable is direct democracy. PierreJoseph Proudhon argued that the only acceptable form of direct democracy is one in which it is recognised that majority decisions are not binding on the minority even when unanimous. 213 However anarchocommunist Murray Bookchin criticised individualist anarchists for opposing democracy 214 and says majority rule is consistent with anarchism. 215  Some anarchocommunists oppose the majoritarian nature of direct democracy feeling that it can impede individual liberty and optin favour of a nonmajoritarian form of consensus democracy similar to Proudhons position on direct democracy. 216  Sortition is the process of choosing decisionmaking bodies via a random selection. These bodies can be more representative of the opinions and interests of the people at large than an elected legislature or other decisionmaker. The technique was in widespread use in Athenian Democracy and Renaissance Florence 217 and is still used in modern jury selection and citizens assemblies. Consociational democracy also called consociationalism is a form of democracy based on powersharing formula between elites representing the social groups within the society. In 1969 Arendt Lijphart argued this would stabilize democracies with factions. 218 A consociational democracy allows for simultaneous majority votes in two or more ethnoreligious constituencies and policies are enacted only if they gain majority support from both or all of them. The Qualified majority voting rule in European Council of Ministers is a consociational democracy approach for supranational democracies. This system in Treaty of Rome allocates votes to member states in part according to their population but heavily weighted in favour of the smaller states. A consociational democracy requires consensus of representatives while consensus democracy requires consensus of electorate. needs update  Consensus democracy 219 requires consensus decisionmaking and supermajority to obtain a larger support than majority. In contrast in majoritarian democracy minority opinions can potentially be ignored by votewinning majorities. 220 Constitutions typically require consensus or supermajorities. 221  Inclusive democracy is a political theory and political project that aims for direct democracy in all fields of social life political democracy in the form of facetoface assemblies which are confederated economic democracy in a stateless moneyless and marketless economy democracy in the social realm i.e. selfmanagement in places of work and education and ecological democracy which aims to reintegrate society and nature. The theoretical project of inclusive democracy emerged from the work of political philosopher Takis Fotopoulos in Towards An Inclusive Democracy and was further developed in the journal Democracy Nature and its successor The International Journal of Inclusive Democracy. A Parpolity or Participatory Polity is a theoretical form of democracy that is ruled by a Nested Council structure. The guiding philosophy is that people should have decisionmaking power in proportion to how much they are affected by the decision. Local councils of 25 50 people are completely autonomous on issues that affect only them and these councils send delegates to higher level councils who are again autonomous regarding issues that affect only the population affected by that council. A council court of randomly chosen citizens serves as a check on the tyranny of the majority and rules on which body gets to vote on which issue. Delegates may vote differently from how their sending council might wish but are mandated to communicate the wishes of their sending council. Delegates are recallable at any time. Referendums are possible at any time via votes of lowerlevel councils however not everything is a referendum as this is most likely a waste of time. A parpolity is meant to work in tandem with a participatory economy. Cosmopolitan democracy also known as Global democracy or World Federalism is a political system in which democracy is implemented on a global scale either directly or through representatives. An important justification for this kind of system is that the decisions made in national or regional democracies often affect people outside the constituency who by definition cannot vote. By contrast in a cosmopolitan democracy the people who are affected by decisions also have a say in them. 222  According to its supporters any attempt to solve global problems is undemocratic without some form of cosmopolitan democracy. The general principle of cosmopolitan democracy is to expand some or all of the values and norms of democracy including the rule of law the nonviolent resolution of conflicts and equality among citizens beyond the limits of the state. To be fully implemented this would require reforming existing international organisations e.g. the United Nations as well as the creation of new institutions such as a World Parliament which ideally would enhance public control over and accountability in international politics. Cosmopolitan Democracy has been promoted among others by physicist Albert Einstein 223 writer Kurt Vonnegut columnist George Monbiot and professors David Held and Daniele Archibugi. 224 The creation of the International Criminal Court in 2003 was seen as a major step forward by many supporters of this type of cosmopolitan democracy. Creative Democracy is advocated by American philosopher John Dewey. The main idea about Creative Democracy is that democracy encourages individual capacity building and the interaction among the society. Dewey argues that democracy is a way of life in his work of Creative Democracy The Task Before Us 225 and an experience built on faith in human nature faith in human beings and faith in working with others. Democracy in Deweys view is a moral ideal requiring actual effort and work by people it is not an institutional concept that exists outside of ourselves. The task of democracy Dewey concludes is forever that of creation of a freer and more humane experience in which all share and to which all contribute. Guided democracy is a form of democracy that incorporates regular popular elections but which often carefully guides the choices offered to the electorate in a manner that may reduce the ability of the electorate to truly determine the type of government exercised over them. Such democracies typically have only one central authority which is often not subject to meaningful public review by any other governmental authority. Russianstyle democracy has often been referred to as a Guided democracy. 226 Russian politicians have referred to their government as having only one center of power authority as opposed to most other forms of democracy which usually attempt to incorporate two or more naturally competing sources of authority within the same government. 227  Aside from the public sphere similar democratic principles and mechanisms of voting and representation have been used to govern other kinds of groups. Many nongovernmental organisations decide policy and leadership by voting. Most trade unions and cooperatives are governed by democratic elections. Corporations are ultimately governed by their shareholders through shareholder democracy. Corporations may also employ systems such as workplace democracy to handle internal governance. Amitai Etzioni has postulated a system that fuses elements of democracy with sharia law termed Islamocracy. 228 There is also a growing number of Democratic educational institutions such as Sudbury schools that are cogoverned by students and staff. Shareholder democracy is a concept relating to the governance of corporations by their shareholders. In the United States shareholders are typically granted voting rights according to the one share one vote principle. Shareholders may vote annually to elect the companys board of directors who themselves may choose the companys executives. The shareholder democracy framework may be inaccurate for companies which have different classes of stock that further alter the distribution of voting rights. Several justifications for democracy have been postulated. Social contract theory argues that the legitimacy of government is based on consent of the governed i.e. an election and that political decisions must reflect the general will. Some proponents of the theory like JeanJacques Rousseau advocate for a direct democracy on this basis. 229  Condorcets jury theorem is logical proof that if each decisionmaker has a better than chance probability of making the right decision then having the largest number of decisionmakers i.e. a democracy will result in the best decisions. This has also been argued by theories of the wisdom of the crowd. In Why Nations Fail economists Daron Acemoglu and James A. Robinson argue that democracies are more economically successful because undemocratic political systems tend to limit markets and favor monopolies at the expense of the creative destruction which is necessary for sustained economic growth. A 2019 study by Acemoglu and others estimated that countries switching to democratic from authoritarian rule had on average a 20 higher GDP after 25 years than if they had remained authoritarian. The study examined 122 transitions to democracy and 71 transitions to authoritarian rule occurring from 1960 to 2010. 230 Acemoglu said this was because democracies tended to invest more in health care and human capital and reduce special treatment of regime allies. 231  Democracy promotion also referred to as democracy building can be domestic policy to increase the quality of already existing democracy or a strand of foreign policy adopted by governments and international organizations that seek to support the spread of democracy as a system of government. Among the reasons for supporting democracy include the belief that countries with a democratic system of governance are less likely to go to war are likely to be economically better off and socially more harmonious. 232 In democracy building the process includes the building and strengthening of democracy in particular the consolidation of democratic institutions including courts of law police forces and constitutions. 233 Some critics have argued that the United States has used democracy promotion to justify military intervention abroad. 234 235  Much experience was gained after the Revolutions of 1989 resulted in the fall of the Iron Curtain and a wave of democratic transitions in former Communist states particularly in Central and Eastern Europe. According to Freedom House the number of democracies increased from 41 of 150 existing states in 1974 to 123 of 192 states in 2006. 236 The pace of transition slowed considerably since the beginning of the twentyfirst century which encouraged discussion of whether democracy was under threat. 237 In the early twentyfirst century a democratic deficit was noticed in countries where democratic systems already existed including Britain the US and the European Union. 238 In the financial sense democracy promotion grew from 2 of aid in 1990 to nearly 20 in 2005. 239  Democracy promotion can increase the quality of already existing democracies reduce political apathy and the chance of democratic backsliding. Democracy promotion measures include voting advice applications 241 participatory democracy 242 increasing youth suffrage increasing civic education 243 reducing barriers to entry for new political parties 244 increasing proportionality 245 and reducing presidentialism. 246  A democratic transition describes a phase in a countries political system often created as a result of an incomplete change from an authoritarian regime to a democratic one or vice versa. 247 248  Several philosophers and researchers have outlined historical and social factors seen as supporting the evolution of democracy.Other commentators have mentioned the influence of economic development. 251 In a related theory Ronald Inglehart suggests that improved livingstandards in modern developed countries can convince people that they can take their basic survival for granted leading to increased emphasis on selfexpression values which correlates closely with democracy. 252 253  Douglas M. Gibler and Andrew Owsiak in their study argued about the importance of peace and stable borders for the development of democracy. It has often been assumed that democracy causes peace but this study shows that historically peace has almost always predated the establishment of democracy. 254  Carroll Quigley concludes that the characteristics of weapons are the main predictor of democracy 255 256 Democracy this scenario tends to emerge only when the best weapons available are easy for individuals to obtain and use. 257 By the 1800s guns were the best personal weapons available and in the United States of America already nominally democratic almost everyone could afford to buy a gun and could learn how to use it fairly easily. Governments could not do any better it became the age of mass armies of citizen soldiers with guns. 257 Similarly Periclean Greece was an age of the citizen soldier and democracy. 258  Other theories stressed the relevance of education and of human capital and within them of cognitive ability to increasing tolerance rationality political literacy and participation. Two effects of education and cognitive ability are distinguished 259 need quotation to verify 260 261  Evidence consistent with conventional theories of why democracy emerges and is sustained has been hard to come by. Statistical analyses have challenged modernisation theory by demonstrating that there is no reliable evidence for the claim that democracy is more likely to emerge when countries become wealthier more educated or less unequal. 262 In fact empirical evidence shows that economic growth and education may not lead to increased demand for democratization as modernization theory suggests historically most countries attained high levels of access to primary education well before transitioning to democracy. 263 Rather than acting as a catalyst for democratization in some situations education provision may instead be used by nondemocratic regimes to indoctrinate their subjects and strengthen their power. 263  The assumed link between education and economic growth is called into question when analyzing empirical evidence. Across different countries the correlation between education attainment and math test scores is very weak .07. A similarly weak relationship exists between perpupil expenditures and math competency .26. Additionally historical evidence suggests that average human capital measured using literacy rates of the masses does not explain the onset of industrialization in France from 1750 to 1850 despite arguments to the contrary. 264 Together these findings show that education does not always promote human capital and economic growth as is generally argued to be the case. Instead the evidence implies that education provision often falls short of its expressed goals or alternatively that political actors use education to promote goals other than economic growth and development. Some scholars have searched for the deep determinants of contemporary political institutions be they geographical or demographic. 265 266  An example of this is the disease environment. Places with different mortality rates had different populations and productivity levels around the world. For example in Africa the tsetse fly which afflicts humans and livestock reduced the ability of Africans to plough the land. This made Africa less settled. As a consequence political power was less concentrated. 267 This also affected the colonial institutions European countries established in Africa. 268 Whether colonial settlers could live or not in a place made them develop different institutions which led to different economic and social paths. This also affected the distribution of power and the collective actions people could take. As a result some African countries ended up having democracies and others autocracies. An example of geographical determinants for democracy is having access to coastal areas and rivers. This natural endowment has a positive relation with economic development thanks to the benefits of trade. 269 Trade brought economic development which in turn broadened power. Rulers wanting to increase revenues had to protect propertyrights to create incentives for people to invest. As more people had more power more concessions had to be made by the ruler and in many quantify places this process lead to democracy. These determinants defined the structure of the society moving the balance of political power. 270  Robert Michels asserts that although democracy can never be fully realised democracy may be developed automatically in the act of striving for democracy The peasant in the fable when on his deathbed tells his sons that a treasure is buried in the field. After the old mans death the sons dig everywhere in order to discover the treasure. They do not find it. But their indefatigable labor improves the soil and secures for them a comparative wellbeing. The treasure in the fable may well symbolise democracy. 271  Democracy in modern times has almost always faced opposition from the previously existing government and many times it has faced opposition from social elites. The implementation of a democratic government from a nondemocratic state is typically brought by peaceful or violent democratic revolution. Some democratic governments have experienced sudden state collapse and regime change to an undemocratic form of government. Domestic military coups or rebellions are the most common means by which democratic governments have been overthrown. 285 See List of coups and coup attempts by country and List of civil wars. Examples include the Spanish Civil War the Coup of 18 Brumaire that ended the First French Republic and the 28 May 1926 coup d tat which ended the First Portuguese Republic. Some military coups are supported by foreign governments such as the 1954 Guatemalan coup d tat and the 1953 Iranian coup d tat. Other types of a sudden end to democracy include Democratic backsliding can end democracy in a gradual manner by increasing emphasis on national security and eroding free and fair elections freedom of expression independence of the judiciary rule of law. A famous example is the Enabling Act of 1933 which lawfully ended democracy in Weimar Germany and marked the transition to Nazi Germany. 287  Temporary or longterm political violence and government interference can prevent free and fair elections which erode the democratic nature of governments. This has happened on a local level even in wellestablished democracies like the United States for example the Wilmington insurrection of 1898 and AfricanAmerican disfranchisement after the Reconstruction era. Criticism of democracy or debate on democracy and the different aspects of how to implement democracy best have been widely discussed. There are both internal critics those who call upon the constitutional regime to be true to its own highest principles and external ones who reject the values promoted by constitutional democracy. 288  Criticism of democracy has been a key part of democracy its functions and its development throughout history. Plato famously opposed democracy arguing for a government of the best qualified James Madison extensively studied the historic attempts at and arguments on democracy in his preparation for the Constitutional Convention and Winston Churchill remarked that No one pretends that democracy is perfect or allwise. Indeed it has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all those other forms that have been tried from time to time. 289  The theory of democracy relies on the implicit assumption that voters are well informed about social issues policies and candidates so that they can make a truly informed decision. Since the late 20th century there has been a growing concern that voters may be poorly informed because the news media are focusing more on entertainment and gossip and less on serious journalistic research on political issues. 293 294  The media professors Michael Gurevitch and Jay Blumler have proposed a number of functions that the mass media are expected to fulfill in a democracy 295  This proposal has inspired a lot of discussions over whether the news media are actually fulfilling the requirements that a well functioning democracy requires. 296 Commercial mass media are generally not accountable to anybody but their owners and they have no obligation to serve a democratic function. 296 297 They are controlled mainly by economic market forces. Fierce economic competition may force the mass media to divert themselves from any democratic ideals and focus entirely on how to survive the competition. 298 299  The tabloidization and popularization of the news media is seen in an increasing focus on human examples rather than statistics and principles. There is more focus on politicians as personalities and less focus on political issues in the popular media. Election campaigns are covered more as horse races and less as debates about ideologies and issues. The dominating media focus on spin conflict and competitive strategies has made voters perceive the politicians as egoists rather than idealists. This fosters mistrust and a cynical attitude to politics less civic engagement and less interest in voting. 300 301 302 The ability to find effective political solutions to social problems is hampered when problems tend to be blamed on individuals rather than on structural causes. 301 This personcentered focus may have farreaching consequences not only for domestic problems but also for foreign policy when international conflicts are blamed on foreign heads of state rather than on political and economic structures. 303 304 A strong media focus on fear and terrorism has allowed military logic to penetrate public institutions leading to increased surveillance and the erosion of civil rights. 305  The responsiveness 306 and accountability of the democratic system is compromised when lack of access to substantive diverse and undistorted information is handicapping the citizens capability of evaluating the political process. 297 302 The fast pace and trivialization in the competitive news media is dumbing down the political debate. Thorough and balanced investigation of complex political issues does not fit into this format. The political communication is characterized by short time horizons short slogans simple explanations and simple solutions. This is conducive to political populism rather than serious deliberation. 297 305  Commercial mass media are often differentiated along the political spectrum so that people can hear mainly opinions that they already agree with. Too much controversy and diverse opinions are not always profitable for the commercial news media. 307 Political polarization is emerging when different people read different news and watch different TV channels. This polarization has been worsened by the emergence of the social media that allow people to communicate mainly with groups of likeminded people the socalled echo chambers. 308 Extreme political polarization may undermine the trust in democratic institutions leading to erosion of civil rights and free speech and in some cases even reversion to autocracy. 309  Many media scholars have discussed noncommercial news media with public service obligations as a means to improve the democratic process by providing the kind of political contents that a free market does not provide. 310 311 The World Bank has recommended public service broadcasting in order to strengthen democracy in developing countries. These broadcasting services should be accountable to an independent regulatory body that is adequately protected from interference from political and economic interests. 312 Public service media have an obligation to provide reliable information to voters. Many countries have publicly funded radio and television stations with public service obligations especially in Europe and Japan 313 while such media are weak or nonexistent in other countries including the US. 314 Several studies have shown that the stronger the dominance of commercial broadcast media over public service media the less the amount of policyrelevant information in the media and the more focus on horse race journalism personalities and the pecadillos of politicians. Public service broadcasters are characterized by more policyrelevant information and more respect for journalistic norms and impartiality than the commercial media. However the trend of deregulation has put the public service model under increased pressure from competition with commercial media. 313 315 316  The emergence of the internet and the social media has profoundly altered the conditions for political communication. The social media have given ordinary citizens easy access to voice their opinion and share information while bypassing the filters of the large news media. This is often seen as an advantage for democracy. 317 The new possibilities for communication have fundamentally changed the way social movements and protest movements operate and organize. The internet and social media have provided powerful new tools for democracy movements in developing countries and emerging democracies enabling them to bypass censorship voice their opinions and organize protests. 318 319  A serious problem with the social media is that they have no truth filters. The established news media have to guard their reputation as trustworthy while ordinary citizens may post unreliable information. 318 In fact studies show that false stories are going more viral than true stories. 320 321 The proliferation of false stories and conspiracy theories may undermine public trust in the political system and public officials. 321 309  Reliable information sources are essential for the democratic process. Less democratic governments rely heavily on censorship propaganda and misinformation in order to stay in power while independent sources of information are able to undermine their legitimacy. 322 ,

Summit for Democracy 2023On March 2930 2023 the United States will cohost the second Summit for Democracy with the governments of Costa Rica the Netherlands Republic of Korea and Republic of Zambia. The second Summit for Democracy will assemble world leaders in a virtual plenary format followed by gatherings in each of the cohosted countries with representatives from government civil society and the private sector. Building on the first Summit for Democracy held in December 2021 this gathering will highlight how democracies deliver for their citizens and are best equipped to address the world s most pressing challenges. At the first Summit in December 2021 approximately 100 governments made nearly 750 commitments to advance democracy counter authoritarianism and fight corruption. The 2023 Summit will be an opportunity for world leaders to showcase progress made on their commitments to build more resilient democracies announce new commitments and initiatives to build on that momentum and underscore the effectiveness of collective action. During the first Summit for Democracy President Biden announced the establishment of the Presidential Initiative for Democratic Renewal a landmark set of policy and foreign assistance initiatives that build upon the U.S. Government s significant ongoing work to bolster democracy and defend human rights globally.  USAID will participate in the Summit for Democracy and highlight our work that strengthens democracy and supports democratic ambitions. We will champion a vision of our world that is grounded in democratic values transparent responsive and accountable governance rule of law and respect for human rights. In this inflection point in history the United States with our partners and allies is committed to leading the world toward a more peaceful prosperous future for all. No matter how challenging the problems we face we know that democracy remains the best tool we have to unleash our human potential and deliver for all our people and we will continue to champion it.

BodySo first before talking about what I think we can do and what the Media Viability Accelerator will do which youve already alluded to just to stay in the darkness a moment longer. You know I think its we have the data to show the importance of independent media in actually just improving citizen welfare. BodyThank you to Secretary Blinken for being such a powerful partner in the work to affirm democratic values through technology. And thank you to our panelists who in the face of rising digital repression are showing us how technologies can build more democratic societies still. BodyI think you know one way to think about the importance of independent media is to reflect on moments when people are forced to live without it. And I was struck last year Internews Ukraine an NGO produced a documentary that showed what happened when Putin s illegal invasion of Ukraine cut off one community s access to internet and to TV in Eastern Ukraine. And we re all so besieged with information and social media and regular media this was like a throwback because the community had no almost no access to any media for weeks. And there they were at the center of the biggest story in the world with no way of knowing how their fellow Ukrainians were inspiring the world with their resilience how other nations were rallying behind Ukraine including of course the Netherlands. BodyPeople s trust in each other and their institutions is fundamental to an effective democracy. Yet in recent decades political polarization has intensified globally and has been a disruptive force in societies across the world even in the U.S. These divisions are often caused by economic exclusion the rise of identity politics and the powerful influence of social media and they can leave countries paralyzed by inaction and worse yet vulnerable to violence.,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Economist_Democracy_Index, The Democracy Index published by the Economist Group is an index measuring the quality of democracy across the world. This quantitative and comparative assessment is centrally concerned with democratic rights and democratic institutions. The methodology for assessing democracy used in this democracy index is according to Economist Intelligence Unit which is part of the Economist Group a UKbased private company which publishes the weekly newspaper The Economist. The index is based on 60 indicators grouped into five categories measuring pluralism civil liberties and political culture. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking the index categorizes each country into one of four regime types full democracies flawed democracies hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes. The first Democracy Index report was published in 2006. Reports were published every two years until 2010 and annually thereafter. The index includes 167 countries and territories of which 166 are sovereign states and 164 are UN member states. Other democracy indices with similar assessments of the state of democracy 1 include VDem Democracy indices or Bertelsmann Transformation Index. As described in the report 2 the Democracy Index produces a weighted average based on the answers to 60 questions each one with either two or three permitted answers. Most answers are experts assessments. Some answers are provided by publicopinion surveys from the respective countries. In the case of countries for which survey results are missing survey results for similar countries and expert assessments are used in order to fill in gaps. Each answer is converted to a score either 0 or 1 or for the threeanswer questions 0 0.5 or 1. With the exceptions mentioned below within each category the scores are added multiplied by ten and divided by the total number of questions within the category. There are a few modifying dependencies which are explained much more precisely than the main rule procedures. In a few cases an answer yielding zero for one question voids another question e.g. if the elections for the national legislature and head of government are not considered free question 1 then the next question Are elections... fair? is not considered but automatically scored zero. Likewise there are a few questions considered so important that a low score on them yields a penalty on the total score sum for their respective categories namely The five category indices which are listed in the report are then averaged to find the overall score for a given country. Finally the score rounded to two decimals decides the regimetype classification of the country. The report discusses other indices of democracy as defined e.g. by Freedom House and argues for some of the choices made by the team from the Economist Intelligence Unit. In this comparison a higher emphasis is placed on the public opinion and attitudes as measured by surveys but on the other hand economic livingstandards are not weighted as one criterion of democracy as seemingly some other investigators have done. 3 4  The report is widely cited in the international press as well as in peerreviewed academic journals. 5  The following table indicates the number of nations and the percentage of world population for each type of regime. Some microstates are not considered in the calculation. The following table lists the average of each country scored by geographic region as defined by the Economist Democracy Index. The following table lists the number of countries in each of the four democracy classifications. The following table shows each nations score over the years. The regions are assigned by the Economist Intelligence Unit and may differ from conventional classifications for example Turkey is grouped in Western Europe. The following table shows the five parameters that made up the score of each nation in 2023 and the changes that had occurred since 2022. In 2016 the United States was downgraded from a full democracy to a flawed democracy 8 its score which had been declining for some years crossed the threshold from 8.05 in 2015 to 7.98 in 2016. The report stated that this was caused by myriad factors dating back to at least the late 1960s which have eroded Americans trust in governmental institutions. 9 10 Nigeria was also upgraded from an authoritarian regime to a hybrid regime. The 2017 Democracy Index registered at the time the worst year for global democracy since 2010 11. Asia was the region with the largest decline since 2016. Venezuela was downgraded from a hybrid regime to an authoritarian regime. In China Xi Jinping General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party CCP further entrenched his power by writing his contribution to the CCPs ideology dubbed Xi Jinping Thought into the partys constitution. Moldova was downgraded from a flawed democracy to a hybrid regime as a result of problematic elections. By contrast Armenia was reupgraded from an authoritarian regime to a hybrid regime as a result of constitutional changes that shifted power from the presidency to parliament. 11 In 2017 the Gambia was upgraded again from an authoritarian regime to a hybrid regime after Yahya Jammeh who was president from 1996 to 2017 was defeated by Adama Barrow an opposition candidate in the 2016 presidential elections. In 2019 France Portugal and Chile were upgraded from flawed democracies to full democracies. In fact this was not a new experience for the former two which suffered from the eurozone crisis many years before. By contrast Malta was downgraded from a full democracy to a flawed democracy. Thailand and Albania were upgraded from hybrid regimes to flawed democracies. 12 Algeria was upgraded again from an authoritarian regime to a hybrid regime. In 2020 Taiwan was upgraded from flawed democracy to full democracy following reforms in the judiciary 13 and soared to 11th position from its previous position at 33. Japan and South Korea were also upgraded again to a full democracy while France and Portugal were once again relegated to flawed democracies. Hong Kong was downgraded from a flawed democracy to a hybrid regime. Algeria was downgraded again from a hybrid regime to an authoritarian regime. The Economist Intelligence Unit noted that democracy was dealt a major blow in 2020. 14 Almost 70 of countries covered by the Democracy Index recorded a decline in their overall score as most of them imposed lockdowns and other restrictions in response to the COVID19 pandemic in addition to some arresting journalists and citizens accused of spreading COVID19 misinformation. The global average score fell to its lowest level since the index began in 2006. In 2021 both the global and regional average scores continued downward trends with the exception of the Central and Eastern Europe region. Spain and Chile were downgraded from full democracies to flawed democracies while Ecuador Mexico Paraguay and Tunisia were downgraded from flawed democracies to hybrid regimes. Haiti Lebanon and Kyrgyzstan were downgraded from hybrid regimes to authoritarian regimes. In addition Moldova Montenegro and North Macedonia were upgraded from hybrid regimes to flawed democracies whereas Mauritania was upgraded from authoritarian to hybrid regime. For the first time two countries displaced North Korea as the lowestranked states in the Democracy Index in Myanmar the elected government was overthrown in a military coup and protests were suppressed by the junta which ultimately resulted in its score going down by 2.02 points Afghanistan as a result of the 2021 Taliban offensive and subsequent takeover of government registered the lowest score of any state ever recorded on the Democracy Index at 0.32. In 2022 the global average score stagnated with the lifting of COVIDrelated restrictions being largely canceled out by other negative developments globally. In 2023 the global average score deteriorated further with most declines occurring in authoritarian and hybrid regimes with the former becoming more entrenched and the latter struggling to democratize. The threshold for each color has also been changed from greater than the integer to greater than or equal to. 15  Investment analyst Peter Tasker has criticised the Democracy Index for lacking transparency and accountability beyond the numbers. To generate the index the Economist Intelligence Unit has a scoring system in which various experts are asked to answer 60 questions and assign each reply a number with the weighted average deciding the ranking. However the final report does not indicate what kinds of experts nor their number nor whether the experts are employees of the Economist Intelligence Unit or independent scholars nor the nationalities of the experts. 16 ,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-democracy, List of forms of government Edemocracy a blend of the terms electronic and democracy also known as digital democracy or Internet democracy uses information and communication technology ICT in political and governance processes. 1 2 The term is credited to digital activist Steven Clift. 3 4 5 By using 21stcentury ICT edemocracy seeks to enhance democracy including aspects like civic technology and Egovernment. Proponents argue that by promoting transparency in decisionmaking processes edemocracy can empower all citizens to observe and understand the proceedings. Also if they possess overlooked data perspectives or opinions they can contribute meaningfully. This contribution extends beyond mere informal disconnected debate it facilitates citizen engagement in the proposal development and actual creation of a countrys laws. In this way edemocracy has the potential to incorporate crowdsourced analysis more directly into the policymaking process. 6  Electronic democracy incorporates a diverse range of tools that use both existing and emerging information sources. These tools provide a platform for the public to express their concerns interests and perspectives and to contribute evidence that may influence decisionmaking processes at the community national or global level. Edemocracy leverages both traditional broadcast technologies such as television and radio as well as newer interactive internetenabled devices and applications including polling systems. These emerging technologies have become popular means of public participation allowing a broad range of stakeholders to access information and contribute directly via the internet. Moreover large groups can offer realtime input at public meetings using electronic polling devices. 7  Utilizing information and communication technology ICT edemocracy bolsters political selfdetermination. It collects social economic and cultural data to enhance democratic engagement. As a concept that encompasses various applications within differing democratic structures edemocracy has substantial impacts on political norms and public engagement. It emerges from theoretical explorations of democracy and practical initiatives to address societal challenges through technology. The extent and manner of its implementation often depend on the specific form of democracy adopted by a society thus shaped by both internal dynamics and external technological developments. When designed to present both supporting and opposing evidence and arguments for each issue apply conflict resolution and Cost benefit analysis techniques and actively address confirmation bias and other cognitive biases EDemocracy could potentially foster a more informed citizenry. However the development of such a system poses significant challenges. These include designing sophisticated platforms to achieve these aims navigating the dynamics of populism while acknowledging that not everyone has the time or resources for fulltime policy analysis and debate promoting inclusive participation and addressing cybersecurity and privacy concerns. Despite these hurdles some envision edemocracy as a potential facilitator of more participatory governance a countermeasure to excessive partisan dogmatism a problemsolving tool a means for evaluating the validity of procon arguments and a method for balancing power distribution within society. Throughout history social movements have adapted to use the prevailing technologies as part of their civic engagement and social change efforts. This trend persists in the digital era illustrating how technology shapes democratic processes. As technology evolves it inevitably impacts all aspects of society including governmental operations. This ongoing technological advancement brings new opportunities for public participation and policymaking while presenting challenges such as cybersecurity threats issues related to the digital divide and privacy concerns. Society is actively grappling with these complexities striving to balance leveraging technology for democratic enhancement and managing its associated risks. Edemocracy incorporates elements of both representative and direct democracy. In representative democracies which characterize most modern systems responsibilities such as lawmaking policy formation and regulation enforcement are entrusted to elected officials. This differs from direct democracies where citizens undertake these duties themselves. Motivations for edemocracy reforms are diverse and reflect the desired outcomes of its advocates. Some aim to align government actions more closely with the publics interest akin to Populism diminish the influence of media political parties and lobbyists or use public input to assess potential costs and benefits of each policy. Edemocracy in its unstructured form emphasizes direct participation and has the potential to redistribute political power from elected officials to individuals or groups. However reforms aimed at maximizing benefits and minimizing costs might require structures that mimic a form of representation conceivable if the public had the capacity to debate and analyze issues fulltime. Given the design of electronic forums that can accommodate extensive debate edemocracy has the potential to mimic aspects of representation on a much larger scale. These structures could involve public education initiatives or systems that permit citizens to contribute based on their interests or expertise. From this standpoint edemocracy appears less concerned with what the public believes to be true and more focused on the evidence the public can demonstrate as true. This view reveals a tension within edemocratic reforms between populism and an evidencebased approach akin to the scientific method or the Enlightenment principles. A key indicator of the effectiveness of a democratic system is the successful implementation of policy. To facilitate this voters must comprehend the implications of each policy approach evaluate its costs and benefits and consider historical precedents for policy effectiveness. Some proponents of edemocracy argue that technology can enable citizens to perform these tasks as effectively if not more so than traditional political parties within representative democracies. By harnessing technological advancements edemocracy has the potential to foster more informed decisionmaking and enhance citizen involvement in the democratic process. Edemocracy traces back to the development of information and communication technology ICT and the evolution of democratic structures. It encompasses initiatives from governments to interact with citizens through digital means and grassroots activities using electronic platforms to influence governmental practices. The inception of edemocracy corresponds with the rise of the Internet in the late 20th century. The diffusion of personal computers and the Internet during the 1990s led to the initiation of electronic government initiatives. Digital platforms such as forums chat rooms and email lists were pivotal in fostering public discourse thereby encouraging informal civic engagement online. These platforms provided an accessible medium for individuals to discuss ideas and issues and they were utilized by both governments and citizens to promote dialogue advocate for change and involve the public in decisionmaking processes. The structure of the Internet which currently embodies characteristics such as decentralization open standards and universal access has been observed to align with principles often associated with democracy. These democratic principles have their roots in federalism and Enlightenment values like openness and individual liberty. 8  Steven Clift a notable proponent of edemocracy suggests that the Internet should be utilized to enhance democratic processes and provide increased opportunities for interaction between individuals communities and the government. He emphasizes the importance of structuring citizentocitizen discussions online within existing power structures and maintaining significant reach within the community for these discussions to hold agendasetting potential. 8  The concept involves endorsing individuals or policies committed to leveraging internet technologies to amplify public engagement without modifying or substituting existing constitutions. The approach includes data collection analysis of advantages and disadvantages evaluation of interests and facilitating discussions around potential outcomes. 9  In the late 20th century and early into the 21st century edemocracy started to become more structured as governments worldwide started to explore its potential. One major development was the rise of egovernment initiatives which aimed to provide public services online. One of the first instances of such an initiative was the establishment of the Government Information Locator Service GILS by the United States government in 1994. 10 GILS was a searchable database of government information accessible to citizens and businesses and it served as a tool to improve agency electronic records management practices. Along with the rise of egovernment services government websites started to spring up aiming to improve communication with citizens increase transparency and make administrative tasks easier to accomplish online. The mid2000s ushered in the era of Web 2.0 emphasizing usergenerated content interoperability and collaboration. This period witnessed the rise of social media platforms blogs and other collaborative tools further amplifying the potential for edemocracy through increasing opportunities for public participation and interaction. Concepts like crowdsourcing and opensource governance gained traction advocating for broader and more direct public involvement in policymaking. 11  As the digital age progressed so too did the interaction between governments and citizens. The advent and rapid adoption of the internet globally catalyzed this transformation. With high internet penetration in many regions politics have increasingly relied on the internet as a primary source of information for numerous people. This digital shift has been supported by the rise in online advertising among political candidates and groups actively trying to sway public opinion or directly influence legislators. 12  This trend is especially noticeable among younger voters who often regard the internet as their primary source of information due to its convenience and ability to streamline their informationgathering process. The userfriendly nature of search engines like Google and social networks encourages increased citizen engagement in political research and discourse. Social networks for instance offer platforms where individuals can voice their opinions on governmental issues without fear of judgement. 13 The vast scale and decentralized structure of the internet enable anyone to create viral content and influence a wide audience. The Internet facilitates citizens in accessing and disseminating information about politicians while simultaneously providing politicians with insights from a broader citizen base. This collaborative approach to decisionmaking and problemsolving empowers citizens. It accelerates decisionmaking processes by politicians thereby fostering a more efficient society. Gathering citizen feedback and perspectives is essential to a politicians role. The Internet functions as a conduit for effective engagement with a larger audience. Consequently this enhanced communication with the public strengthens the capability and effectiveness of the American government as a democracy. 14  The 2016 U.S. presidential election is an example of social media integration in political campaigns where both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton actively utilized Twitter as a communication tool. These platforms allow candidates to shape public perceptions while also humanizing their personas suggesting that political figures are as approachable and relatable as ordinary individuals. Through resources such as Google the Internet enables every citizen to readily research political topics. Social media platforms like Facebook Twitter and Instagram encourage political engagement allowing users to share their political views and connect with likeminded individuals. citation needed  Generation Xs disillusionment with political processes epitomized by largescale public protests such as the U.K. miners strike of 19841985 that appeared to fail predated the widespread availability of information technology to individual citizens. 15 There is a perception that edemocracy could address some of these concerns by offering a counter to the insularity power concentration and postelection accountability deficit often associated with traditional democratic processes organized primarily around political parties. citation needed Tom Watson the Deputy Leader of the U.K. Labour Party once stated It feels like the Labour frontbench is further away from our members than at any point in our history and the digital revolution can help bring the party closer together Im going to ask our NEC to see whether we can have digital branches and digital delegates to the conference. Not replacing what we do but providing an alternative platform. Its a way of organizing for a different generation of people who do their politics differently get their news differently. Despite the benefits of the digital shift one of the challenges of edemocracy is the potential disconnect between politics and actual government implementation. While the internet provides a platform for robust political discourse translating these discussions into effective government action can be complex. This gap can often be exacerbated by the rapid pace of digital dialogue which may outpace the slower more deliberative processes of policymaking. The rise of digital media has created new opportunities for citizens to participate in politics and to hold governments accountable. However it has also created new challenges such as the potential for echo chambers and the need for governments to be responsive to citizen concerns. 17 The challenge for edemocracy therefore is to ensure that the digital discourse contributes constructively to the functioning of the government and the decisionmaking processes rather than becoming an echo chamber of opinions with little practical impact. As of the 2020s edemocracys landscape continues to evolve alongside advancements in technologies such as artificial intelligence blockchain and big data. These technologies promise to expand citizen participation further enhance transparency and boost the overall efficiency and responsiveness of democratic governance. 18  The history of edemocracy exhibits significant progress but it is also characterized by ongoing debates and challenges such as the digital divide data privacy cybersecurity and the impact of misinformation. As this journey continues the emphasis remains on leveraging technology to enhance democratic processes and ensure all citizens voices are heard and valued. 19  Edemocracy promotes wider access to information and its inherent decentralization challenges censorship practices. It embodies elements of the internets origins including strong libertarian support for freedom of speech widespread sharing culture and the National Science Foundations commercial use prohibition. The internets capacity for mass communication evident in newsgroups chat rooms and MUDs surpasses traditional boundaries associated with broadcast media like newspapers or radio as well as personal media such as letters or landline telephones. As the Internet represents a vast digital network supporting open standards achieving widespread costeffective access to a diverse range of communication media and models is feasible. 20  Practical issues pertaining to edemocracy include managing the agenda while encouraging meaningful participation and fostering enlightened understanding. Furthermore efforts are evaluated based on their ability to ensure voting equality and promote inclusivity. The success or failure of edemocracy largely depends on its capability to accurately delineate each issues relevant costs and benefits identify their likelihood and significance and align votes with this analysis. In addition all internet forums including Wikipedia must address cybersecurity and protect sensitive data. 21  The Occupy movement which proposed various demonstrations in response to the financial crisis of 2007 08 extensively utilized social networks. 22  Originating in Spain and subsequently spreading to other European countries the 15M Movement gave rise to proposals by the Partido X X Party in Spain. 23 24  During the Arab Spring uprisings across North Africa and the Middle East were spearheaded by online activists. Initially prodemocracy movements harnessed digital media to challenge authoritarian regimes. These regimes however adapted and integrated social media into their counterinsurgency strategies over time. Digital media served as a critical tool in transforming localized and individual dissent into structured movements with a shared awareness of common grievances and opportunities for collective action. 25  The Egyptian Revolution began on 25 January 2011 prompted by mass protests in Cairo Egypt against the long reign of President Hosni Mubarak high unemployment governmental corruption poverty and societal oppression. The 18day revolution gained momentum not through initial acts of violence or protests but via a single Facebook page which quickly attracted the attention of thousands and eventually millions of Egyptians evolving into a global phenomenon. 26  The Internet became a tool of empowerment for the protestors facilitating participation in their governments democratization process. Protestors effectively utilized digital platforms to communicate organize and collaborate generating realtime impact. 27  In response to the regimes failed attempt to disrupt political online discussions by severing all internet access Google and Twitter collaborated to create a system that allowed information to reach the public without internet access. 28  The interactive nature of media during this revolution enhanced civic participation and played a significant role in shaping the political outcome of the revolution and the democratization of the entire nation. The Egyptian Revolution has been interpreted by some as a paradigm shift from a groupcontrolled system to one characterized by networked individualism. This transformation is tied to the posttriple revolution of technology consisting of three key developments. First the shift towards social networks second the widespread propagation of the instantaneous internet and third the ubiquity of mobile phones. 29  These elements significantly impacted change through the Internet providing an alternative unregulated sphere for idea formation and protests. For instance the 6 April Youth Movement in Egypt established their political group on Facebook and called for a national strike. Despite the subsequent suppression of this event the Facebook group persisted encouraging other activist groups to utilize online media. Moreover the Internet served as a medium for building international connections amplifying the impact of the revolt. The rapid transmission of information via Twitter hashtags for example made the uprising globally known. In particular over three million tweets contained popular hashtags such as Egypt and sidibouzid further facilitating the spread of knowledge and fostering change in Egypt. 29  The Kony 2012 video released on 5 March 2012 by the nonprofit organization Invisible Children launched an online grassroots campaign aimed at locating and arresting Joseph Kony the leader of the Lords Resistance Army LRA in Central Africa. The videos mission was to raise global awareness about Konys activities with Jason Russell a founder of Invisible Children emphasizing the necessity of public support to urge the governments continued search for Kony. 30 The organization leveraged the extensive reach of social media and contemporary technology to spotlight Konys crimes. In response to the campaign on 21 March 2012 a resolution was introduced by 33 Senators denouncing the crimes against humanity perpetrated by Kony and the LRA. This resolution supported the US governments ongoing efforts to boost the capabilities of regional military forces for civilian protection and the pursuit of LRA commanders. It also advocated for crossborder initiatives to augment civilian protection and aid populations affected by the LRA. Cosponsor Senator Lindsey Graham noted the significant impact of public attention driven by social media stating that the YouTube sensation would help the Congress be more aggressive and will do more to lead to his demise than all other action combined. 31  The India Against Corruption IAC movement was an influential anticorruption crusade in India garnering substantial attention during the anticorruption protests of 2011 and 2012. Its primary focus was the contention surrounding the proposed Jan Lokpal bill. IAC sought to galvanize the populace in their pursuit of a less corrupt Indian society. However internal divisions within the IACs central committee led to the movements split. Arvind Kejriwal left to establish the Aam Aadmi Party while Anna Hazare created the Jantantra Morcha. Long March is a sociopolitical movement in Pakistan initiated by Qadri after returning from a sevenyear residence in Toronto Ontario Canada in December 2012. Qadri called for a millionmen march in Islamabad to protest government corruption. 32 The march commenced on 14 January 2013 with thousands pledging to participate in a sitin until their demands were met. 33 The march began in Lahore with about 25000 participants. 34 During a rally in front of the parliament Qadri critiqued the legislators saying There is no Parliament there is a group of looters thieves and dacoits bandits ... Our lawmakers are the lawbreakers.. 35 After four days of sitin Qadri and the government reached an agreement termed the Islamabad Long March Declaration which pledged electoral reforms and enhanced political transparency. 36 Despite Qadris call for a millionmen march the government estimated the sitin participants in Islamabad to number around 50000. The Five Star Movement M5S a prominent political party in Italy has been utilizing online voting since 2012 to select its candidates for Italian and European elections. These votes are conducted through a webbased application called Rousseau accessible to registered members of Beppe Grillos blog. 37  Within this platform M5S users are able to discuss approve or reject legislative proposals. These proposals are then presented in Parliament by the M5S group. 38 For instance the M5Ss electoral law and the selection of its presidential candidate were determined via online voting. 39 40 Notably the decision to abolish a law against immigrants was made by online voting among M5S members in opposition to the views of Grillo and Casaleggio. 41  M5Ss alliance with the UK Independence Party was also determined by online voting albeit with limited options for the choice of European Parliament group for M5S. These were Europe of Freedom and Democracy EFD European Conservatives and Reformists ECR and Stay independent NonInscrits. The possibility of joining the GreensEFA group was discussed but not available at the time due to the groups prior rejection of M5S. 42 43  When the Conte I Cabinet collapsed a new coalition between the Democratic Party and M5S was endorsed after over 100000 members voted online with 79.3 supporting the new coalition. 44  The COVID19 pandemic has underscored the importance and impact of edemocracy. citation needed In 2020 45 the advent of COVID19 led countries worldwide to implement safety measures as recommended by public health officials. This abrupt societal shift constrained social movements causing a temporary halt to certain political issues. Despite these limitations individuals leveraged digital platforms to express their views create visibility for social movements and strive to instigate change and raise awareness through democracy in social media. As reported by news analysis firm The ASEAN Post the pandemicinduced limitations on traditional democratic spaces such as public meetings have led Filipinos among others to resort to social media digital media and collaborative platforms for engaging in public affairs and practising active citizenship in the virtual domain. 45 This shift has enabled active participation in social written or visual interaction and the rectification of misinformation in a virtual setting. citation needed  Edemocracy has the potential to inspire greater community involvement in political processes and policy decisions interlacing its growth with complex internal aspects such as political norms and public pressure. 12 The manner in which it is implemented is also closely connected to the specific model of democracy employed. 46 Consequently edemocracy is profoundly influenced by a countrys internal dynamics as well as the external drivers defined by standard innovation and diffusion theory. 12  In the current age where the internet and social networking dominate daily life individuals are increasingly advocating for their public representatives to adopt practices similar to those in other states or countries concerning the online dissemination of government information. By making government data easily accessible and providing straightforward channels to communicate with government officials edemocracy addresses the needs of modern society. Edemocracy promotes more rapid and efficient dissemination of political information encourages public debate and boosts participation in decisionmaking processes. 47 Social media platforms have emerged as tools of empowerment particularly among younger individuals stimulating their participation in electoral processes. These platforms also afford politicians opportunities for direct engagement with constituents. A notable example is the 2016 United States presidential elections in which Donald Trump primarily used Twitter to communicate policy initiatives and goals. Similar practices have been observed among various global leaders such as Justin Trudeau Jair Bolsonaro and Hassan Rouhani who maintain active Twitter accounts. Some observers who? argue that the governments online publication of public information enhances its transparency enabling more extensive public scrutiny and consequently promoting a more equitable distribution of power within society. 48  Jane Fountain in her 2001 work Building the Virtual State delves into the expansive reach of edemocracy and its interaction with traditional governmental structures. She offers a comprehensive model to understand how preexisting norms procedures and rules within bureaucracies impact the adoption of new technological forms. Fountain suggests that this form of egovernment in its most radical manifestation would necessitate a significant overhaul of the modern administrative state with routine electronic consultations involving elected politicians civil servants pressure groups and other stakeholders becoming standard practice at all stages of policy formulation. States where legislatures are controlled by the Republican Party as well as those characterized by a high degree of legislative professionalization and active professional networks have shown a greater propensity to embrace egovernment and edemocracy. 49  Edemocracy provides numerous benefits contributing to a more engaged public sphere. It encourages increased public participation by offering platforms for citizens to express their opinions through websites emails and other electronic communication channels influencing planning and decisionmaking processes. 7  This digital democracy model broadens the number and diversity of individuals who exercise their democratic rights by conveying their thoughts to decisionmaking bodies about various proposals and issues. Moreover it cultivates a virtual public space fostering interaction discussion and the exchange of ideas among citizens. Edemocracy also promotes convenience allowing citizens to participate at their own pace and comfort. Its digital nature enables it to reach vast audiences with relative ease and minimal cost. The system promotes interactive communication encouraging dialogue between authorities and citizens. It also serves as an effective platform for disseminating large amounts of information maintaining clarity and minimizing distortion. While edemocracy platforms also known as digital democracy platforms offer enhanced opportunities for exercising voting rights they are also susceptible to disruption. Digital voting platforms for example have faced attacks aimed at influencing election outcomes. As Dobrygowski states cybersecurity threats to the integrity of both electoral mechanisms and government institutions are quite uncomfortably more intangible. 50 While traditional paper ballots are often considered the most secure method for conducting elections digital voting provides the convenience of electronic participation. However the successful implementation of this system necessitates continual innovations and contributions from third parties. To foster a robust digital democracy its imperative to promote digital inclusion that ensures all citizens regardless of income education gender religion ethnicity language physical and mental health have equal opportunities to participate in public policy formulation. During the 2020 elections digital communications were utilized by various communities to cultivate a sense of inclusivity. 51  Specifically the COVID19 pandemic saw a surge in online political participation among the youth demonstrated by the signing of online petitions and participation in digital protests. Even as youth participation in traditional politics dwindles young people show significant support for pressure groups mobilized through social media. 52  For instance the Black Lives Matter movement gained widespread recognition on social media enabling many young people to participate in meaningful ways including online interactions and protests. 53  EDemocracy is facilitated by its significance in fostering participation promoting social inclusivity displaying sensitivity to individual perspectives and offering flexible means of engagement. The Internet endows a sense of relevance to participation by giving everyone a platform for their voices to be heard and articulated. It also facilitates a structure of social inclusivity through a broad array of websites groups and social networks each representing diverse viewpoints and ideas. Individual needs are met by enabling the public and rapid expression of personal opinions. Furthermore the Internet offers an exceptionally flexible environment for engagement it is costeffective and widely accessible. Through these attributes edemocracy and the deployment of the Internet can play a pivotal role in societal change. 54  The progression of edemocracy is impeded by the digital divide which separates those actively engaged in electronic communities from those who do not participate. Proponents of edemocracy often recommend governmental actions to bridge this digital gap. 55 The divergence in egovernance and edemocracy between the developed and the developing world is largely due to the digital divide. 56 Practical concerns include the digital divide that separates those with access from those without and the opportunity cost associated with investments in edemocracy innovations. There also exists a degree of skepticism regarding the potential impact of online participation. 57  The government has a responsibility to ensure that online communications are both secure and respectful of individuals privacy. This aspect gains prominence when considering electronic voting. The complexity of electronic voting systems surpasses other digital transaction mechanisms necessitating authentication measures that can counter ballot manipulation or its potential threat. These measures may encompass the use of smart cards which authenticate a voters identity while maintaining the confidentiality of the cast vote. Electronic voting in Estonia exemplifies a successful approach to addressing the privacyidentity dilemma inherent in internet voting systems. However the ultimate goal should be to match the security and privacy standards of existing manual systems. Despite these advancements recent research has indicated through a SWOT analysis that the risks of an egovernment are related to data loss privacy and security and user adoption. 58  To encourage citizens to engage in online consultations and discussions the government needs to be responsive and clearly demonstrate that public engagement influences policy outcomes. Its crucial for citizens to have the opportunity to contribute at a time and place that suits them and when their viewpoints will make a difference. The government should put structures in place to accommodate increased participation. Considering the role that intermediaries and representative organizations might play could be beneficial to ensure issues are debated in a manner that is democratic inclusive tolerant and productive. To amplify the efficacy of existing legal rights allowing public access to information held by public authorities citizens ought to be granted the right to productive public deliberation and moderation. 59  Some researchers argue that many initiatives have been driven by technology rather than by the core values of government which has resulted in weakened democracy.  Edemocracy presents an opportunity to reconcile the conventional tradeoff between the size of the group involved in democratic processes and the depth of will expression refer to the Figure. Historically broad group participation was facilitated via simple ballot voting but the depth of will expression was confined to predefined options those on the ballot. Depth of will expression was obtained by limiting participant numbers through representative democracy refer to the Table. The social media Web 2.0 revolution has demonstrated the possibility of achieving both large group sizes and depth of will expression. However expressions of will in social media are unstructured making their interpretation challenging and often subjective see Table. Novel information processing methods including big data analytics and the semantic web suggest potential ways to exploit these capabilities for future edemocracy implementations. 60 Currently edemocracy processes are facilitated by technologies such as electronic mailing lists peertopeer networks collaborative software and apps like GovernEye Countable VoteSpotter wikis internet forums and blogs.  The examination of edemocracy encompasses its various stages including information provision deliberation and participation in decisionmaking. 61 This assessment also takes into account the different hierarchical levels of governance such as local communities statesregions nations and the global stage. 62 Further the scope of involvement is also considered which includes the participation of citizensvoters the media elected officials political organizations and governments. 63 Therefore edemocracys evolution is influenced by such broad changes as increased interdependency technological multimediation partnership governance and individualism. 64  Social media platforms such as Facebook Twitter WordPress and Blogspot are increasingly significant in democratic dialogues. 65 66 The role of social media in edemocracy is an emerging field of study along with technological developments such as argument maps and the semantic web. 60  Another notable development is the combination of open social networking communication with structured communication from closed expert andor policymaker panels such as through the modified Delphi method HyperDelphi. 67 68  This approach seeks to balance distributed knowledge and selforganized memories with critical control responsibility and decisionmaking in electronic democracy. Social networking serves as an entry point within the citizens environment engaging them on their terms. Proponents of egovernment believe this helps the government act more in tune with its public. Examples of state usage include The Official Commonwealth of Virginia Homepage 69 where citizens can find Google tools and open social forums considered significant steps towards the maturity of edemocracy. 60  Civic engagement encompasses three key aspects understanding public affairs political knowledge trust in the political system political trust and involvement in governmental decisionmaking processes political participation. 70 The internet enhances civic engagement by creating a new medium for interaction with government institutions. 71  Advocates of edemocracy propose that it can facilitate more active government engagement 72 and inspire citizens to actively influence decisions that directly affect them. 73  Numerous studies indicate an increased use of the internet for obtaining political information. From 1996 to 2002 the percentage of adults claiming that the internet played a significant role in their political choices rose from around 14 to 20 percent. 74 In 2002 almost a quarter of the population stated that they had visited a website to research specific public policy issues. Research has indicated that people are more likely to visit websites that challenge their viewpoints rather than those that align with their own beliefs. citation needed Around 16 percent of the population has participated in online political activities such as joining campaigns volunteering time donating money or participating in polls. A survey conducted by Philip N. Howard revealed that nearly twothirds of the adult population in the United States has interacted with online political news information or other content over the past four election cycles. 74 People tend to reference the websites of special interest groups more frequently than those of specific elected leaders political candidates political parties nonpartisan groups and local community groups. The vast informational capacity of the Internet empowers citizens to gain a deeper understanding of governmental and political affairs while its interactive nature fosters new forms of communication with elected officials and public servants. By providing access to contact information legislation agendas and policies governments can enhance transparency thereby potentially facilitating more informed participation both online and offline. 75  As articulated by Matt Leighninger the internet bolsters government by enhancing individual empowerment and reinforcing group agency. 76 The internet avails vital information to citizens empowering them to influence public policy more effectively. The utilization of online tools for organizing allows citizens to participate more easily in the governments policymaking process leading to a surge in public engagement. Social media platforms foster networks of individuals whose online activities can shape the political process including prompting politicians to intensify public appeal efforts in their campaigns. Edemocracy offers a digital platform for public dialogue enhancing the interaction between government and its residents. This form of online engagement enables the government to concentrate on key issues the community wishes to address. The underpinning philosophy is that every citizen should have the potential to influence their local governance. Edemocracy aligns with local communities and provides an opportunity for any willing citizen to make a contribution. The essence of an effective edemocracy lies not just in citizen contribution to government activities but in promoting mutual communication and collaboration among citizens for the improvement of their own communities. 77 397  Edemocracy utilizes information and communication technologies ICT to bolster the democratic processes of decisionmaking. These technologies play a pivotal role in informing and organizing citizens in different avenues of civic participation. Moreover ICTs enhance the active engagement of citizens and foster collaboration among stakeholders for policy formation within political processes across all stages of governance. 78 79  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD identifies three key aspects regarding the role of ICTs in fostering civic engagement. The first aspect is timing with most civic engagement activities occurring during the agendasetting phase of a cycle. The second factor is adaptation which refers to how ICTs evolve to facilitate increased civic participation. The final aspect is integration representing how emerging ICTs blend new and traditional methods to maximize civic engagement. 80  ICT fosters the possibility of a government that is both more democratic and better informed by facilitating open online collaborations between professionals and the public. The responsibility of collecting information and making decisions is shared between those possessing technological expertise and the traditionally recognized decisionmakers. This broadened public involvement in the exchange of ideas and policies results in more democratic decisionmaking. Furthermore ICT enhances the notion of pluralism within a democracy introducing fresh issues and viewpoints. 81  Ordinary citizens have the opportunity to become creators of political content and commentary for instance by establishing individual blogs and websites. Collaborative efforts in the online political sphere similar to ABC News Campaign Watchdog initiative allow citizens to report any rule violations committed by any political party during elections. 82  In the 2000 United States presidential race candidates frequently utilized their websites to not only encourage their supporters to vote but to motivate their friends to vote as well. This dualprocess approach urging an individual to vote and then to prompt their friends to vote was just beginning to emerge during that time. Today political participation through various social media platforms is typical and civic involvement via online forums is common. Through the use of ICTs individuals interested in politics have the ability to become more engaged. 82  In previous years individuals belonging to Generation X Generation Y and Generation Z typically encompassing those aged 35 and below as of the mid2000s have been noted for their relative disengagement from political activities. 83 The implementation of electronic democracy has been proposed as a potential solution to foster increased voter turnout democratic participation and political literacy among these younger demographics. 84 85  Youth ecitizenship presents a dichotomy between two predominant approaches management and autonomy. The strategy of targeting younger individuals prompting them to play their part can be interpreted as either an incentive for youth activism or a mechanism to regulate it. 86  Autonomous ecitizens argue that despite their relative inexperience young people should have the right to voice their perspectives on issues that they personally consider important. Conversely proponents of managed ecitizenship view youth as nascent citizens transitioning from childhood to adulthood and hence not yet fully equipped to engage in political discourse without proper guidance. Another significant concern is the role of the Internet with advocates of managed ecitizenship arguing that young people may be especially susceptible to misinformation or manipulation online. This discord manifests as two perspectives on democracy one that sees democracy as an established and reasonably just system where young people should be motivated to participate and another that views democracy as a political and cultural goal best achieved through networks where young people interact. What might initially appear as mere differences in communication styles ultimately reveals divergent strategies for accessing and influencing power. 86  The Highland Youth Voice an initiative in Scotland is an exemplar of efforts to bolster democratic participation particularly through digital means. 87 Despite an increasing emphasis on the youth demographic in UK governmental policy and issues their engagement and interest have been waning. During the 2001 elections to the Westminster Parliament in the UK voter turnout among 18 to 24yearolds was estimated to be a mere 40. This contrasts starkly with the fact that over 80 of 16 to 24yearolds have accessed the internet at some point. 88  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child emphasizes the importance of educating young individuals as citizens of their respective nations. It advocates for the promotion of active political participation which they can shape through robust debate and communication. The Highland Youth Voice strives to boost youth participation by understanding their governmental needs perspectives experiences and aspirations. It provides young Scots aged 14 to 18 an opportunity to influence decisionmakers in the Highlands. 89  This body consisting of approximately 100 elected members represents youth voices. Elections occur biennially and candidates are chosen directly from schools and youth forums. The Highland Youth Voice website serves as a pivotal platform where members can discuss issues pertinent to them partake in online policy debates and experience a model of edemocracy through simplified online voting. Thus the website encompasses three key features forming an online forum that enables youth selfeducation participation in policy discourse and engagement in the edemocracy process. Civil society organizations have a pivotal role in democracies as highlighted by theorists such as Alexis de Tocqueville acting as platforms for citizens to gain knowledge about public affairs and as sources of power beyond the states reach. According to Hans Klein a public policy researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology there exist several obstacles to participation in these forums including logistical challenges of physical meetings. 90 Kleins study of a civic association in the northeastern US revealed that electronic communication significantly boosted the organizations capacity to achieve its objectives. Given the relatively low cost of exchanging information over the Internet and its potential for wide reach the medium has become an attractive venue for disseminating political information especially among interest groups and parties operating on smaller budgets. For example environmental or social interest groups might leverage the Internet as a costeffective mechanism to raise awareness around their causes. Unlike traditional media outlets like television or newspapers which often necessitate substantial financial investments the Internet provides an affordable and extensive platform for information dissemination. As such the Internet could potentially supplant certain traditional modes of political communication such as telephone television newspapers and radio. Consequently civil society has been increasingly integrating into the online realm. 91  Civic society encompasses various types of associations. The term interest group is typically used to refer to formal organizations focused on specific social groups economic sectors like trade unions business and professional associations or specific issues such as abortion gun control or the environment. 92 Many of these traditional interest groups have wellestablished organizational structures and formal membership rules primarily oriented towards influencing government and policymaking processes. Transnational advocacy networks assemble loose coalitions of these organizations under common umbrella organizations that cross national borders. Innovative tools are increasingly being developed to empower bloggers webmasters and social media owners. These aim to transition from the Internets strictly informational use to its application as a medium for social organization independent of topdown initiatives. For instance the concept of Calls to action is a novel approach that enables webmasters to inspire their audience into action without the need for explicit leadership. This trend is global with countries like India cultivating an active blogosphere that encourages internet users to express their perspectives and opinions. 93  The Internet serves multifaceted roles for these organizations. It functions as a platform for lobbying elected officials public representatives and policy elites networking with affiliated associations and groups mobilizing organizers activists and members through action alerts newsletters and emails raising funds and recruiting support and conveying their messages to the public via traditional news media channels. The Internet holds a pivotal role in deliberative democracy a model that underscores dialogue open discussion and access to diverse perspectives in decisionmaking. 94 It provides an interactive platform and functions as a vital instrument for research within the deliberative process. The Internet facilitates the exchange of ideas through a myriad of platforms such as websites blogs and social networking sites like Twitter all of which champion freedom of expression.citation needed It allows for easily accessible and costeffective information paving the way for change. One of the intrinsic attributes of the Internet is its unregulated nature offering a platform for all viewpoints regardless of their accuracy. The autonomy granted by the Internet can foster and advocate change a critical factor in edemocracy. A notable development in the application of edemocracy in the deliberative process is the California Report Card. This tool was created by the Data and Democracy Initiative of the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society at the University of California Berkeley in collaboration with Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom. 95 Launched in January 2014 the California Report Card is a web application optimized for mobile use aimed at facilitating online deliberative democracy. The application features a brief opinion poll on six pertinent issues after which participants are invited to join an online caf . In this space they are grouped with users sharing similar views through Principal Component Analysis and are encouraged to participate in the deliberative process by suggesting new political issues and rating the suggestions of other participants. The design of the California Report Card is intended to minimize the influence of private agendas on the discussion. Openforum.com.au also exemplifies eDemocracy. This nonprofit Australian project facilitates highlevel policy discussions drawing participants such as politicians senior public servants academics business professionals and other influential stakeholders. The Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act OPEN Act presented as an alternative to SOPA and PIPA garners the support of major companies like Google and Facebook. Its website Keep The Web Open 96 not only provides full access to the bill but also incorporates public input over 150 modifications have been made through user contributions. 97 98  The peertopatent project allows public participation in the patent review process by providing research and prior art publications for patent examiners to assess the novelty of an invention. In this process the community nominates ten pieces of prior art to be reviewed by the patent examiner. This not only enables direct communication between the public and the patent examiner but also creates a structured environment that prompts participants to provide relevant information to aid in decisionmaking. By allowing experts and the general public to collaborate in finding solutions the project aims to enhance the efficacy of the decisionmaking process. It offers a platform for citizens to participate and express their ideas beyond merely checking boxes that limit their opinions to predefined options. 99  One significant challenge in implementing edemocracy is ensuring the security of internetvoting systems. The potential interference from viruses and malware which could alter or inhibit citizens votes on critical issues hinders the widespread adoption of edemocracy as long as such cybersecurity threats persist. citation needed  Evoting presents several practical challenges that can affect its legitimacy in elections. For instance electronic voting machines can be vulnerable to physical interference as they are often left unattended prior to elections making them susceptible to tampering. This issue led to a decision by the Netherlands in 2017 to count election votes manually. 100 Furthermore Direct Recording Electronic DRE systems used in numerous US states are quickly becoming outdated and prone to faults. A study by USENIX discovered that certain DREs in New Jersey inaccurately counted votes potentially casting votes for unintended candidates without voters knowledge. The study found these inconsistencies to be widespread with that specific machine. 101 Despite the potential of electronic voting to increase voter turnout the absence of a paper trail in DREs can lead to untraceable errors which could undermine its application in digital democracy. Diminished participation in democracy may stem from the proliferation of polls and surveys potentially leading to a condition known as survey fatigue. 102  Through Listservs RSS feeds mobile messaging microblogging services and blogs government and its agencies can disseminate information to citizens who share common interests and concerns. For instance many government representatives including Rhode Island State Treasurer Frank T. Caprio have begun to utilize Twitter as an easy medium for communication. Several nongovernmental websites like transparent.gov.com 103 and USA.gov 104 have developed crossjurisdiction customerfocused applications that extract information from thousands of governmental organizations into a unified system making it easier for citizens to access information. Edemocracy has led to a simplified process and access to government information for publicsector agencies and citizens. For example the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles simplified the process of certifying driver records for admission in county court proceedings. Indiana became the first state to allow government records to be digitally signed legally certified and delivered electronically using Electronic Postmark technology. 105  The internet has increased government accessibility to news policies and contacts in the 21st century. In 2000 only two percent of government sites offered three or more services online in 2007 that figure was 58 percent. Also in 2007 89 percent of government sites allowed the public to email a public official directly rather than merely emailing the webmaster West 2007Issuu. Information and communications technologies can be utilized for both democratic and antidemocratic purposes. For instance digital technology can be used to promote both coercive control and active participation. 46 The vision of antidemocratic use of technology is exemplified in George Orwells Nineteen EightyFour. Critiques associated with direct democracy are also considered applicable to edemocracy. This includes the potential for direct governance to cause the polarization of opinions populism and demagoguery. 46  The current inability to protect internet traffic from interference and manipulation has significantly limited the potential of edemocracy for decisionmaking. As a result most experts express opposition to the use of the internet for widespread voting. 106 107 108 109 110  In countries with severe government censorship the full potential of edemocracy might not be realized. Internet clampdowns often occur during extensive political protests. For instance the series of internet blackouts in the Middle East in 2011 termed as the Arab Net Crackdown provides a significant example. Governments in Libya Egypt Bahrain Syria Iran and Yemen have all implemented total internet censorship in response to the numerous prodemocracy demonstrations within their respective nations. 111 These lockdowns were primarily instituted to prevent the dissemination of cell phone videos that featured images of government violence against protesters. 112  Joshua A. Tucker and his colleagues critique edemocracy pointing out that the adaptability and openness of social media may allow political entities to manipulate it for their own ends. 113 They suggest that authorities could use social media to spread authoritarian practices in several ways. Firstly by intimidating opponents monitoring private conversations and even jailing those who voice undesirable opinions. Secondly by flooding online spaces with proregime messages thereby diverting and occupying these platforms. Thirdly by disrupting signal access to hinder the flow of information. Lastly by banning globalized platforms and websites. 113  A study that interviewed elected officials in Austrias parliament revealed a broad and strong opposition to edemocracy. These officials held the view that citizens generally uninformed should limit their political engagement to voting. The task of sharing opinions and ideas they contended belonged solely to elected representatives. 114 12  Contrary to this view theories of epistemic democracy suggest that greater public engagement contributes to the aggregation of knowledge and intelligence. This active participation proponents argue enables democracies to better discern the truth. The introduction of H.R. 3261 the Stop Online Piracy Act SOPA in the United States House of Representatives was perceived by many internet users as an attack on internet democracy. 115 116 A contributor to the Huffington Post argued that defeating SOPA was crucial for the preservation of democracy and freedom of speech. 115  Significantly SOPA was indefinitely postponed following widespread protests which included a site blackout by popular websites like Wikipedia on 18 January 2012. 117  A comparable event occurred in India towards the end of 2011 when the countrys Communication and IT Minister Kapil Sibal suggested prescreening content for offensive material before its publication on the internet with no clear mechanism for appeal. 65 Subsequent reports however quote Sibal as stating that there would be no restrictions on internet use. 118  A radical shift from a representative government to an internetmediated direct democracy is not considered likely. citation needed Nonetheless proponents suggest that a hybrid model which leverages the internet for enhanced governmental transparency and greater community involvement in decisionmaking could be forthcoming. 119 The selection of committees local town and city decisions and other peoplecentric decisions could be more readily facilitated through this approach. This doesnt indicate a shift in the principles of democracy but rather an adaptation in the tools utilized to uphold them. Edemocracy would not serve as a means to enact direct democracy but rather as a tool to enable a more participatory form of democracy as it exists currently. 120  Supporters of edemocracy often foresee a transition from a representative democracy to a direct democracy facilitated by technology viewing this transition as an ultimate goal of edemocracy. 121 In an electronic direct democracy EDD also referred to as open source governance or collaborative edemocracy citizens are directly involved in the legislative function through electronic means. They vote electronically on legislation propose new legislation and recall representatives if any are retained. Technology to support electronic direct democracy EDD has been researched and developed at the Florida Institute of Technology where it has been applied within student organizations. 122 Many other software development projects are currently underway 123 along with numerous supportive and related projects. 124 Several of these projects are now collaborating on a crossplatform architecture within the framework of the Metagovernment project. 125  EDD as a system is not fully implemented in a political government anywhere in the world although several initiatives are currently forming. Ross Perot was a prominent advocate of EDD when he advocated electronic town halls during his 1992 and 1996 Presidential campaigns in the United States. Switzerland already partially governed by direct democracy is making progress towards such a system. 126 Senator OnLine an Australian political party established in 2007 proposes to institute an EDD system so that Australians can decide which way the senators vote on each and every bill. 127 A similar initiative was formed 2002 in Sweden where the party Direktdemokraterna running for the Swedish parliament offers its members the power to decide the actions of the party over all or some areas of decision or to use a proxy with immediate recall for one or several areas. Liquid democracy or direct democracy incorporating a delegable proxy enables citizens to appoint a proxy for voting on their behalf while retaining the ability to cast their own vote on legislation. This voting and proxy assignment could be conducted electronically. Extending this concept proxies could establish proxy chains for instance if citizen A appoints citizen B and B appoints citizen C and only C votes on a proposed bill Cs vote will represent all three of them. Citizens could also rank their proxies by preference meaning that if their primary proxy does not vote their vote could be cast by their secondchoice proxy. One form of edemocracy that has been proposed is wikidemocracy where the codex of laws in a government legislature could be editable via a wiki similar to Wikipedia. In 2012 J Manuel FelizTeixeira suggested that the resources necessary for implementing wikidemocracy were already accessible. He envisages a system in which citizens can participate in legislative executive and judiciary roles via a wikisystem. Every citizen would have free access to this wiki and a personal ID to make policy reforms continuously until the end of December when all votes would be tallied. 128 Perceived benefits of wikidemocracy include a costfree system that eliminates elections and the need for parliament or representatives as citizens would directly represent themselves and the ease of expressing ones opinion. However there are several potential obstacles and disagreements. The digital divide and educational inequality could hinder the full potential of a wikidemocracy. Similarly differing rates of technological adoption mean that some people might readily accept new methods while others reject or are slow to adapt. 129 Security is also a concern we would need to trust that the system administrators would ensure a high level of integrity to safeguard votes in the public domain. Peter Levine concurs that wikidemocracy could increase discussion on political and moral issues but disagrees with FelizTeixeira arguing that representatives and formal governmental structures would still be needed. 130  The term wikidemocracy is also used to refer to more specific instances of edemocracy. For example in August 2011 in Argentina the voting records from the presidential election were made available to the public in an online format for scrutiny. 131 More broadly the term can refer to the democratic values and environments facilitated by wikis. 132  In 2011 a group in Finland explored the concept of wikidemocracy by creating an online shadow government program. This initiative was essentially a compilation of the political views and goals of various Finnish groups assembled on a wiki. 133  Egora also known as intelligent democracy is a free software application developed for political opinion formation and decisionmaking. It is filed under the copyleft licensing system. The name Egora is a blend of electronic and agora a term from Ancient Greek denoting the central public space in citystates polis. The ancient agora was the hub of public life facilitating social interactions business transactions and discussions. Drawing from this Ancient Greek concept Egora aims to foster a new rational efficient and incorruptible form of democratic organization. It allows users to form their own political philosophies from diverse ideas ascertain the most popular ideas among the public organize meetings to scrutinize and debate these ideas and employ a simple algorithm to identify true representatives of the public will. 134  The theme of edemocracy has frequently appeared in science fiction. Works such as Davids Sling by Marc Stiegler and Enders Game by Orson Scott Card notably predicted forms of the internet before it actually came into existence. These early conceptualizations of the internet and their implications for democracy served as major plot drivers in these stories. In Davids Sling Marc Stiegler presents edemocracy as a strategy leveraged by a team of hackers to construct a computercontrolled smart weapon. They utilize an online debate platform the Information Decision Duel where two parties delve deeply into the intricacies of their arguments dissecting the pros and cons before a neutral referee selects the more convincing side. This fictional portrayal of an internetlike system for public discourse echoes realworld aspirations for edemocracy underscoring thorough issue analysis technological enablement and transparency. 135 The books dedication To those who never stop seeking the third alternatives epitomizes this emphasis on comprehensive issue scrutiny. Orson Scott Cards Enders Game also explores edemocracy with the internet portrayed as a powerful platform for political discourse and social change. Two of the characters siblings Valentine and Peter use this platform to anonymously share their political views gaining considerable influence. Their activities lead to a significant political shift even though they are just children posing as adults. This highlights the issue of true identity within online participation and raises questions about the potential for manipulation in edemocracy. 136  These works provide varied perspectives on the potential benefits and challenges of edemocracy.,
https://www.britannica.com/topic/e-democracy, Our editors will review what you ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. edemocracy the use of information and communication technologies to enhance and in some accounts replace representative democracy. Theorists of edemocracy differ but most share the belief that some of the traditional limits to citizenship in contemporary liberaldemocratic polities problems of scale scarcity of time decline of community and lack of opportunities for policy deliberation can be overcome by new forms of online communication. A distinct body of ideas forms the backdrop to edemocracy in both theory and practice. During the 1960s a generation of political theorists including Benjamin Barber C.B. Macpherson and Carole Pateman established an agenda for participatory democracy that persisted well into the 21st century. During the 1980s many sociologists and political scientists reconsidered the concept of community. Some such as Robert Bellah and colleagues bemoaned the intensification of individualism in American society and called for a new communitarian ethic. Others such as Amitai Etzioni argued in favour of strong emotionally powerful community bonds based around family and locality. The final theoretical inspiration for edemocracy is J rgen Habermas s concept of the public sphere an idealized autonomous sphere of communication in which citizens can freely engage in reasoned debate away from the controlling influence of the state large media corporations and structures of social inequality. The idea of citizens deliberating in freely formed associations in civil society before taking that knowledge up to the level of government recalls the direct democracy of ancient Athens but edemocracy updates this by focusing on how political discourse is mediated. The Internet emerges as a communication medium uniquely suited to providing multiple arenas for public debate that are relatively spontaneous flexible and above all selfgoverned. Community networks first emerged during the 1970s but proliferated in many liberal democracies during the 1990s as the costs of software computers and networking equipment began to fall. Early networks such as the Berkeley Community Memory Project near San Francisco and the Santa Monica Public Electronic Network near Los Angeles used basic technologies such as textbased bulletin boards email and publicaccess terminals in physical public spaces such as stores community centres and libraries. Most community networks are publicprivate schemes that incorporate three main features a highspeed network offered free of charge or at a subsidized rate to households some form of community technology center often based in a community building and an emphasis on creating content specific to the local community. Community networks are based on the idea that by handing to ordinary people the power to shape the production of online information about their local neighbourhood virtual communities can improve geographical communities by creating new social ties and reciprocal trust the ingredients of social capital. Some edemocracy projects have attempted to connect social networks with broader political processes while remaining independent of government parties or interest groups. Foremost among these is Minnesota EDemocracy later EDemocracy.org which was established in 1994 and became one of the world s largest subnationallevel political discussion forums. In the early 21st century there was a significant shift toward attempting to plug online networks into formal political processes. Central and local government agencies as well as legislatures slowly but surely started to experiment with online policy discussions and citizen consultations. These initiatives attempted to provide a bridge between informal online deliberations among citizens and structures of governance that provide an interface with real decisionmaking processes. The deliberative turn in governance has already generated a range of nonInternet methods for involving citizens in policy making such as citizens juries peoples panels local policy forums focus groups minireferendums and petitions. Edemocratic projects introduce the Internet into the mix. These have generally followed two broad models consultative and deliberative. Consultative approaches stress the communication of citizen opinion to government. The assumption is that information is a resource that can be used to provide better policy and administration. Probably the best example of the consultative model in action is the U.S. federal government s erulemaking program. This is designed to allow interest groups and individual citizens to comment on department and agency rules as they are being developed. Deliberative models conceive of a more complex horizontal and multidirectional interactivity. The United Kingdom was a pioneer in experimental attempts to integrate online deliberative forums directly into policy discussions. The U.K. s Hansard Society conducted several experiments from the late 1990s including a discussion on flood management a pathbreaking forum on experiences of domestic violence involving more than 200 women in interactive discussion and an online evidence and discussion forum on the 2002 draft Communications Bill. The latter was the first genuine attempt to integrate an online forum with an established parliamentary committee. Edemocracy has provoked much theoretical discussion. Yet its main themes are increasingly embedded in political practice. They have been enshrined in a wide variety of national and local experiments in many different settings using different forms of computermediated communication in countries as diverse as Australia Canada Denmark Estonia Finland France Germany Italy the Netherlands and Sweden.,

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenian_democracy, Athenian democracy developed around the 6th century BC in the Greek citystate known as a polis of Athens comprising the city of Athens and the surrounding territory of Attica. Although Athens is the most famous ancient Greek democratic citystate it was not the only one nor was it the first multiple other citystates adopted similar democratic constitutions before Athens. 1 2 By the late 4th century BC as many as half of the over one thousand existing Greek cities might have been democracies. 3 Athens practiced a political system of legislation and executive bills. Participation was open to adult free male citizens i.e. not a metic women or slaves. The metics probably constituted no more than 30 percent of the total adult population. 4  Solon in 594 BC Cleisthenes in 508 07 BC and Ephialtes in 462 BC contributed to the development of Athenian democracy. Cleisthenes broke up the unlimited power of the nobility by organizing citizens into ten groups based on where they lived rather than on their wealth. 5 The longestlasting democratic leader was Pericles. After his death Athenian democracy was twice briefly interrupted by oligarchic revolutions in 411 and 404 BC towards the end of the Peloponnesian War. It was modified somewhat after it was restored under Eucleides the most detailed accounts of the system are of this fourthcentury modification rather than the Periclean system. Democracy was suppressed by the Macedonians in 322 BC. The Athenian institutions were later revived but how close they were to a real democracy is debatable. The word democracy Greek d mokratia combines the elements d mos traditionally interpreted people and kr tos which means force or power and thus means literally people power. In the words monarchy and oligarchy the second element comes from arch meaning beginning that which comes first and hence also first place or power sovereignty. One might expect by analogy that the term demarchy would have been adopted for the new form of government introduced by Athenian democrats. However the word demarchy had already been taken and meant mayoralty the office or rank of a high municipal magistrate. In presentday use the term demarchy has acquired a new meaning. It is unknown whether the word democracy was in existence when systems that came to be called democratic were first instituted. The first conceptual articulation of the term is generally accepted to be c. 470 BC with Aeschylus The Suppliants l. 604 with the line sung by the Chorus d mou kratousa cheir . This approximately translates as the peoples hand of power and in the context of the play it acts as a counterpoint to the inclination of the votes cast by the people i.e. that authority as implemented by the people in the Assembly has power. The word is then completely attested in the works of Herodotus Histories 6.43.3 in both a verbal passive and nominal sense with the terms d mokrateomai and d mokratia . Herodotus wrote some of the earliest surviving Greek prose but this might not have been before 440 or 430 BC. Around 460 BC an individual is known with the name of Democrats 6 a name possibly coined as a gesture of democratic loyalty the name can also be found in Aeolian Temnus. 7  Athens was never the only polis in Ancient Greece that instituted a democratic regime. Aristotle points to other cities that adopted governments in the democratic style. However accounts of the rise of democratic institutions are in reference to Athens since only this citystate had sufficient historical records to speculate on the rise and nature of Greek democracy. 8  Before the first attempt at democratic government Athens was ruled by a series of archons or magistrates and the council of the Areopagus made up of exarchons. The members of these institutions were generally aristocrats. In 621 BC Draco replaced the prevailing system of oral law by a written code to be enforced only by a court of law. 9 10 While the laws later come to be known as the Draconian Constitution were largely harsh and restrictive with nearly all of them later being repealed the written legal code was one of the first of its kind and considered to be one of the earliest developments of Athenian democracy. 11 In 594 BC Solon was appointed premier archon and began issuing economic and constitutional reforms in an attempt to alleviate some of the conflict that was beginning to arise from the inequities that permeated throughout Athenian society. His reforms ultimately redefined citizenship in a way that gave each free resident of Attica a political function Athenian citizens had the right to participate in assembly meetings. Solon sought to break away at the strong influence noble families had on the government by broadening the governments structure to include a wider range of property classes rather than just the aristocracy. His constitutional reforms included establishing four property classes the pentakosiomedimnoi the hippeis the zeugitai and the thetes. 12 The classifications were based on how many medimnoi a mans estate made per year with the pentakosiomedimnoi making at least 500 medimnoi the hippeis making 300500 medimnoi the zeugitai making 200300 medimnoi and the thetes making under 200 medimnoi. 12 By granting the formerly aristocratic role to every free citizen of Athens who owned property Solon reshaped the social framework of the citystate. Under these reforms the boule a council of 400 members with 100 citizens from each of Athenss four tribes ran daily affairs and set the political agenda. 9 The Areopagus which formerly took on this role remained but thereafter carried on the role of guardianship of the laws. 13 Another major contribution to democracy was Solons setting up of an Ecclesia or Assembly which was open to all the male citizens. Solon also made significant economic reforms including cancelling existing debts freeing debtors and no longer allowing borrowing on the security of ones own person as a means of restructuring enslavement and debt in Athenian society. 14  In 561 BC the nascent democracy was overthrown by the tyrant Peisistratos but was reinstated after the expulsion of his son Hippias in 510. Cleisthenes issued reforms in 508 and 507 BC that undermined the domination of the aristocratic families and connected every Athenian to the citys rule. Cleisthenes formally identified free inhabitants of Attica as citizens of Athens which gave them power and a role in a sense of civic solidarity. 15 He did this by making the traditional tribes politically irrelevant and instituting ten new tribes each made up of about three trittyes geographical divisions each consisting of several demes further subdivisions. Every male citizen over 18 had to be registered in his deme. 16  The third set of reforms was instigated by Ephialtes in 4621. While Ephialtess opponents were away attempting to assist the Spartans he persuaded the Assembly to reduce the powers of the Areopagus to a criminal court for cases of homicide and sacrilege. At the same time or soon afterward the membership of the Areopagus was extended to the lower level of the propertied citizenship. 17  In the wake of Athenss disastrous defeat in the Sicilian campaign in 413 BC a group of citizens took steps to limit the radical democracy they thought was leading the city to ruin. Their efforts initially conducted through constitutional channels culminated in the establishment of an oligarchy the Council of 400 in the Athenian coup of 411 BC. The oligarchy endured for only four months before it was replaced by a more democratic government. Democratic regimes governed until Athens surrendered to Sparta in 404 BC when the government was placed in the hands of the socalled Thirty Tyrants who were proSpartan oligarchs. 18 After a year prodemocracy elements regained control and democratic forms persisted until the Macedonian army of Phillip II conquered Athens in 338 BC. 19  Philip II had led a coalition of the Greek states to war with Persia in 336 BC but his Greek soldiers were hostages for the behavior of their states as much as allies. Alexander The Greats relations with Athens later strained when he returned to Babylon in 324 BC after his death Athens and Sparta led several states to war with Macedonia and lost. 20  This led to the Hellenistic control of Athens with the Macedonian king appointing a local agent as political governor in Athens. However the governors like Demetrius of Phalerum appointed by Cassander kept some of the traditional institutions in formal existence although the Athenian public would consider them to be nothing more than Macedonian puppet dictators. Once Demetrius Poliorcetes ended Cassanders rule over Athens Demetrius of Phalerum went into exile and the democracy was restored in 307 BC. However by now Athens had become politically impotent. 21 An example of this was that in 307 in order to curry favour with Macedonia and Egypt three new tribes were created two in honour of the Macedonian king and his son and the other in honour of the Egyptian king. However when Rome fought Macedonia in 200 the Athenians abolished the first two new tribes and created a twelfth tribe in honour of the Pergamene king. The Athenians declared for Rome and in 146 BC Athens became an autonomous civitas foederata able to manage internal affairs. This allowed Athens to practice the forms of democracy though Rome ensured that the constitution strengthened the citys aristocracy. 22  Under Roman rule the archons ranked as the highest officials. They were elected and even foreigners such as Domitian and Hadrian held the office as a mark of honour. Four presided over the judicial administration. The council whose numbers varied at different times from 300 to 750 was appointed by lot. It was superseded in importance by the Areopagus which recruited from the elected archons had an aristocratic character and was entrusted with wide powers. From the time of Hadrian an imperial curator superintended the finances. The shadow of the old constitution lingered on and archons and Areopagus survived the fall of the Roman Empire. 22  In 88 BC there was a revolution under the philosopher Athenion who as tyrant forced the Assembly to agree to elect whomever he might ask to office. Athenion allied with Mithridates of Pontus and went to war with Rome he was killed during the war and was replaced by Aristion. The victorious Roman general Publius Cornelius Sulla left the Athenians their lives and did not sell them into slavery he also restored the previous government in 86 BC. 23  After Rome became an Empire under Augustus the nominal independence of Athens dissolved and its government converged to the normal type for a Roman municipality with a Senate of decuriones. 24  Estimates of the population of ancient Athens vary. During the 4th century BC there might well have been some 250000 300000 people in Attica. 4 Citizen families could have amounted to 100000 people and out of these some 30000 would have been adult male citizens entitled to vote in the assembly. In the mid5th century the number of adult male citizens was perhaps as high as 60000 but this number fell precipitously during the Peloponnesian War. 25 This slump was permanent due to the introduction of a stricter definition of citizen described below. From a modern perspective these figures may seem small but among Greek citystates Athens was huge most of the thousand or so Greek cities could only muster 1000 1500 adult male citizens each and Corinth a major power had at most 15000. 26  The noncitizen component of the population was made up of resident foreigners metics and slaves with the latter perhaps somewhat more numerous. Around 338 BC the orator Hyperides fragment 13 claimed that there were 150000 slaves in Attica but this figure is probably no more than an impression slaves outnumbered those of citizen stock but did not swamp them. 27  Only adult male Athenian citizens who had completed their military training as ephebes had the right to vote in Athens. The percentage of the population that actually participated in the government was 10 to 20 of the total number of inhabitants but this varied from the fifth to the fourth century BC. 25 This excluded a majority of the population slaves freed slaves children women and metics foreign residents in Athens. 28 The women had limited rights and privileges had restricted movement in public and were very segregated from the men. 29  For the most part Athens followed a citizenshipthroughbirth criterion. This criterion could be further divided into three categories free birth from an Athenian father free and legitimate birth from an Athenian father and free and legitimate birth from an Athenian father and an Athenian mother. 30 Athenians considered circumstances of ones birth to be relevant to the type of political identity and positions they could hold as citizens. Citizenry in ancient Athens is speculated to have not simply been a legal obligation to the state but also a form of ethnicnationality. The title of Athenian was given to free residents deeming them citizens and granted them special privileges and protections over other residents in the city who were considered noncitizens. 30 In the timeline of Athenian laws Solons laws outlined a clear boundary between the protections that exist between citizens Athenians who were considered free and noncitizens nonAthenians who legally could be subjected to slavery. 30  Also excluded from voting were citizens whose rights were under suspension typically for failure to pay a debt to the city see atimia for some Athenians this amounted to permanent and in fact inheritable disqualification. Given the exclusive and ancestral concept of citizenship held by Greek citystates a relatively large portion of the population took part in the government of Athens and of other radical democracies like it compared to oligarchies and aristocracies. 25  Some Athenian citizens were far more active than others but the vast numbers required for the system to work testify to a breadth of direct participation among those eligible that greatly surpassed any presentday democracy. 25 Athenian citizens had to be descended from citizens after the reforms of Pericles and Cimon in 450 BC only those descended from two Athenian parents could claim citizenship. 31 Although the legislation was not retrospective five years later when a free gift of grain had arrived from the Egyptian king to be distributed among all citizens many illegitimate citizens were removed from the registers. 32  Citizenship applied to both individuals and their descendants. It could also be granted by the assembly and was sometimes given to large groups e.g. Plateans in 427 BC and Samians in 405 BC. However by the 4th century citizenship was given only to individuals and by a special vote with a quorum of 6000. This was generally done as a reward for some service to the state. In the course of a century the number of citizenships so granted was in the hundreds rather than thousands. 33  Xenias Graphe was an action brought against any one who unlawfully exercised the rights of citizenship. If convicted the person was sold as a slave and the property was forfeited to the state. 34  With participation in Athenian Democracy only being available to adult male Athenian citizens women were always left out of government and public roles. Even in the case of citizenry the term was rarely used in reference to women. Rather women were often referred to as an ast which meant a woman belonging to the city or Attik gun which meant an Attic womanwife. Even the term Athenian was largely reserved for just male citizens. 35 Before Pericles law that decreed citizenship to be restricted to children of both Athenian men and women the polis did not register women as citizens or keep any form of registration for them which resulted in many court cases of witnesses having to prove that women were wives of Athenian men. 35  In addition to being barred from any form of formal participation in government women were also largely left out of public discussions and speeches with orators going as far as leaving out the names of wives and daughters of citizens or finding round about ways of referring to them. Pushed out of the public sphere womens role was confined to the private sphere of working in the home and being cast as a secondrate human subservient to her male guardian whether that be a father or husband. In the realm of Athenian mens rationalization part of the reasons for excluding women from politics came from widely held views that women were more sexual and intellectually handicapped. Athenian men believed that women had a higher sex drive and consequentially if given free range to engage in society would be more promiscuous. With this in mind they feared that women may engage in affairs and have sons out of wedlock which would jeopardize the Athenian system of property and inheritance between heirs as well as the citizenry of potential children if their parentage was called into question. 35 In terms of intelligence Athenian men believed that women were less intelligent than men and therefore similarly to barbarians and slaves of the time were considered to be incapable of effectively participating and contributing to public discourse on political issues and affairs. These rationales as well as the barring women from fighting in battle another requirement of citizens meant that in the eyes of Athenian men by nature women were not meant to be allowed citizenship. Despite being barred from the right to vote and citizenship overall women were granted the right to practice religion. 35  Throughout its history Athens had many different constitutions under its different leaders. Some of the history of Athens reforms as well as a collection of constitutions from other Ancient Greek citystates was compiled and synthesized into a large allencompassing constitution created by either Aristotle or one of his students called the Constitution of the Athenians. 36 The Constitution of the Athenians provides a rundown of the structure of Athens government and its processes. There were three political bodies where citizens gathered in numbers running into the hundreds or thousands. These are the assembly in some cases with a quorum of 6000 the council of 500 boule and the courts a minimum of 200 people on some occasions up to 6000. Of these three bodies the assembly and the courts were the true sites of power although courts unlike the assembly were never simply called the demos the people as they were manned by just those citizens over thirty. Crucially citizens voting in both were not subject to review and prosecution as were council members and all other officeholders. In the 5th century BC there is often a record of the assembly sitting as a court of judgment itself for trials of political importance and it is not a coincidence that 6000 is the number both for the full quorum for the assembly and for the annual pool from which jurors were picked for particular trials. By the mid4th century however the assemblys judicial functions were largely curtailed though it always kept a role in the initiation of various kinds of political trial. The central events of the Athenian democracy were the meetings of the assembly ekkles a. Unlike a parliament the assemblys members were not elected but attended by right when they chose. Greek democracy created at Athens was direct rather than representative any adult male citizen over the age of 20 could take part 37 and it was a duty to do so. The officials of the democracy were in part elected by the Assembly and in large part chosen by lottery in a process called sortition. The assembly had four main functions it made executive pronouncements decrees such as deciding to go to war or granting citizenship to a foreigner elected some officials legislated and tried political crimes. As the system evolved the last function was shifted to the law courts. The standard format was that of speakers making speeches for and against a position followed by a general vote usually by show of hands of yes or no. Though there might be blocs of opinion sometimes enduring on important matters there were no political parties and likewise government or opposition as in the Westminster system did not exist. Voting was by simple majority. In the 5th century at least there were scarcely any limits on the power exercised by the assembly. If the assembly broke the law the only thing that might happen is that it would punish those who had proposed that it had agreed to. If a mistake had been made from the assemblys viewpoint it could only be because it had been misled. 38  As usual in ancient democracies one had to physically attend a gathering to vote. Military service or simple distance prevented the exercise of citizenship. Voting was usually by show of hands kheirotonia arm stretching with officials judging the outcome by sight. This could cause problems when it becomes too dark to see properly. However any member could demand that officials issue a recount. 39 For a small category of votes a quorum of 6000 was required principally grants of citizenship and here small colored stones were used white for yes and black for no. At the end of the session each voter tossed one of these into a large clay jar which was afterwards cracked open for the counting of the ballots. Ostracism required the voters to scratch names onto pieces of broken pottery ostraka though this did not occur within the assembly as such. In the 5th century BC there were 10 fixed assembly meetings per year one in each of the ten state months with other meetings called as needed. In the following century the meetings were set to forty a year with four in each state month. One of these was now called the main meeting kyria ekklesia. Additional meetings might still be called especially as up until 355 BC there were still political trials that were conducted in the assembly rather than in court. The assembly meetings did not occur at fixed intervals as they had to avoid clashing with the annual festivals that followed the lunar calendar. There was also a tendency for the four meetings to be aggregated toward the end of each state month. 40  Attendance at the assembly was not always voluntary. In the 5th century public slaves forming a cordon with a redstained rope herded citizens from the agora into the assembly meeting place Pnyx with a fine being imposed on those who got the red on their clothes. 41 After the restoration of democracy in 403 BC pay for assembly attendance was introduced. This promoted a new enthusiasm for assembly meetings. Only the first 6000 to arrive were admitted and paid with the red rope now used to keep latecomers at bay. 42  In 594 BC Solon is said to have created a boule of 400 to guide the work of the assembly. 43 After the reforms of Cleisthenes the Athenian Boule was expanded to 500 and was elected by lot every year. Each of Cleistheness 10 tribes provided 50 councilors who were at least 30 years old. The Boules roles in public affairs included finance maintaining the militarys cavalry and fleet of ships advising the generals approving of newly elected magistrates and receiving ambassadors. Most importantly the Boule would draft probouleumata or deliberations for the Ecclesia to discuss and approve on. During emergencies the Ecclesia would also grant special temporary powers to the Boule. 44  Cleisthenes restricted the Boules membership to those of zeugitai status and above presumably because these classes financial interests gave them an incentive towards effective governance. A member had to be approved by his deme each of which would have an incentive to select those with experience in local politics and the greatest likelihood at effective participation in government. 45  The members from each of the ten tribes in the Boule took it in turns to act as a standing committee the prytaneis of the Boule for a period of thirtysix days. All fifty members of the prytaneis on duty were housed and fed in the tholos of the Prytaneion a building adjacent to the bouleuterion where the boule met. A chairman for each tribe was chosen by lot each day who was required to stay in the tholos for the next 24 hours presiding over meetings of the Boule and Assembly. 46  The boule also served as an executive committee for the assembly and oversaw the activities of certain other magistrates. The boule coordinated the activities of the various boards and magistrates that carried out the administrative functions of Athens and provided from its own membership randomly selected boards of ten responsible for areas ranging from naval affairs to religious observances. 47 Altogether the boule was responsible for a great portion of the administration of the state but was granted relatively little latitude for initiative the boules control over policy was executed in its probouleutic rather than its executive function in the former it prepared measures for deliberation by the assembly in the latter it merely executed the wishes of the assembly. 48  Athens had an elaborate legal system centered on full citizen rights see atimia. The age limit of 30 or older the same as that for office holders but ten years older than that required for participation in the assembly gave the courts a certain standing in relation to the assembly. Jurors were required to be under oath which was not required for attendance at the assembly. The authority exercised by the courts had the same basis as that of the assembly both were regarded as expressing the direct will of the people. Unlike office holders magistrates who could be impeached and prosecuted for misconduct the jurors could not be censured for they in effect were the people and no authority could be higher than that. A corollary of this was that at least acclaimed by defendants if a court had made an unjust decision it must have been because it had been misled by a litigant. 49  Essentially there were two grades of a suit a smaller kind known as dike or private suit and a larger kind known as graphe or public suit. For private suits the minimum jury size was 200 increased to 401 if a sum of over 1000 drachmas was at issue for public suits 501. Under Cleistheness reforms juries were selected by lot from a panel of 600 jurors there being 600 jurors from each of the ten tribes of Athens making a jury pool of 6000 in total. 50 For particularly important public suits the jury could be increased by adding in extra allotments of 500. 1000 and 1500 are regularly encountered as jury sizes and on at least one occasion the first time a new kind of case was brought to court see graph paran m n all 6000 members of the jury pool may have attended to one case. 51  The cases were put by the litigants themselves in the form of an exchange of single speeches timed by a water clock or clepsydra first prosecutor then defendant. In a public suit the litigants each had three hours to speak much less in private suits though here it was in proportion to the amount of money at stake. Decisions were made by voting without any time set aside for deliberation. Jurors did talk informally amongst themselves during the voting procedure and juries could be rowdy shouting out their disapproval or disbelief of things said by the litigants. This may have had some role in building a consensus. The jury could only cast a yes or no vote as to the guilt and sentence of the defendant. For private suits only the victims or their families could prosecute while for public suits anyone ho boulomenos whoever wants to i.e. any citizen with full citizen rights could bring a case since the issues in these major suits were regarded as affecting the community as a whole. Justice was rapid a case could last no longer than one day and had to be completed by the time the sun set. 52 Some convictions triggered an automatic penalty but where this was not the case the two litigants each proposed a penalty for the convicted defendant and the jury chose between them in a further vote. 53 No appeal was possible. There was however a mechanism for prosecuting the witnesses of a successful prosecutor which it appears could lead to the undoing of the earlier verdict. Payment for jurors was introduced around 462 BC and is ascribed to Pericles a feature described by Aristotle as fundamental to radical democracy Politics 1294a37. Pay was raised from two to three obols by Cleon early in the Peloponnesian war and there it stayed the original amount is not known. Notably this was introduced more than fifty years before payment for attendance at assembly meetings. Running the courts was one of the major expenses of the Athenian state and there were moments of financial crisis in the 4th century when the courts at least for private suits had to be suspended. 54  The system showed a marked antiprofessionalism. No judges presided over the courts nor did anyone give legal direction to the jurors. Magistrates had only an administrative function and were laymen. Most of the annual magistracies in Athens could only be held once in a lifetime. There were no lawyers as such litigants acted solely in their capacity as citizens. Whatever professionalism there was tended to disguise itself it was possible to pay for the services of a speechwriter or logographer logographos but this may not have been advertised in court. Jurors would likely be more impressed if it seemed as though litigants were speaking for themselves. 55  As the system evolved the courts that is citizens under another guise intruded upon the power of the assembly. Starting in 355 BC political trials were no longer held in the assembly but only in a court. In 416 BC the graph paran m n indictment against measures contrary to the laws was introduced. Under this anything passed or proposed by the assembly could be put on hold for review before a jury which might annul it and perhaps punish the proposer as well. Remarkably it seems that blocking and then successfully reviewing a measure was enough to validate it without needing the assembly to vote on it. For example two men have clashed in the assembly about a proposal put by one of them it passes and now the two of them go to court with the loser in the assembly prosecuting both the law and its proposer. The quantity of these suits was enormous. The courts became in effect a kind of upper house. In the 5th century there were no procedural differences between an executive decree and a law. They were both simply passed by the assembly. However beginning in 403 BC they were set sharply apart. Henceforth laws were made not in the assembly but by special panels of citizens drawn from the annual jury pool of 6000. These were known as the nomothetai the lawmakers. 56  The institutions sketched above assembly officeholders council courts are incomplete without the figure that drove the whole system Ho boulomenos he who wishes or anyone who wishes. This expression encapsulated the right of citizens to take the initiative to stand to speak in the assembly to initiate a public lawsuit that is one held to affect the political community as a whole to propose a law before the lawmakers or to approach the council with suggestions. Unlike officeholders the citizen initiator was not voted on before taking up office or automatically reviewed after stepping down these institutions had after all no set tenure and might be an action lasting only a moment. However any stepping forward into the democratic limelight was risky. If another citizen initiator chose a public figure could be called to account for their actions and punished. In situations involving a public figure the initiator was referred to as a kategoros accuser a term also used in cases involving homicide rather than ho diokon the one who pursues. 57  Pericles according to Thucydides characterized the Athenians as being very wellinformed on politics  We do not say that a man who takes no interest in politics is a man who minds his own business we say that he has no business here at all. 58  The word idiot originally simply meant private citizen in combination with its more recent meaning of foolish person this is sometimes used by modern commentators to demonstrate that the ancient Athenians considered those who did not participate in politics as foolish. 59 60 61 But the sense history of the word does not support this interpretation. 62 63  Although voters under Athenian democracy were allowed the same opportunity to voice their opinion and to sway the discussion they were not always successful and often the minority was forced to vote in favor of a motion that they did not agree with. 64  Just before the reforms of Solon in the 7th century BC Athens was governed by a few archons three then later nine and the council of the Areopagus which was composed of members of powerful noble families. While there seems to have also been a type of citizen assembly presumably of the hoplite class the archons and the body of the Areopagus ran the state and the mass of people had no say in government at all before these reforms. 65  Originally the archons always chosen from among the aristoi were three magistrates From an unknown date. 71 the three archons became nine archons the three main ones being supported by six others called thesmoth tai a type of judicial administrators. Finally Cleisthenes added a secretary who was in charge of writing the notifications of the other nine archons. Therefore eventually their number reached ten as with other Athenian magistracies. Solons reforms allowed the archons to come from some of the higher propertied classes and not only from the aristocratic families. Since the Areopagus was made up of exarchons this would eventually mean the weakening of the hold of the nobles there as well. However even with Solons creation of the citizens assembly the archons and Areopagus still wielded a great deal of power. 72  The reforms of Cleisthenes meant that the archons were elected by the Assembly but were still selected from the upper classes. 73 The Areopagus kept its power as Guardian of the Laws which meant that it could veto actions it deemed unconstitutional however this worked in practice. 74  Ephialtes and later Pericles stripped the Areopagus of its role in supervising and controlling the other institutions dramatically reducing its power. In the play The Eumenides performed in 458 Aeschylus himself a noble portrays the Areopagus as a court established by Athena herself an apparent attempt to preserve the dignity of the Areopagus in the face of its disempowerment. 17  Approximately 1100 citizens including the members of the council of 500 held office each year. They were mostly chosen by lot with a much smaller and more prestigious group of about 100 elected. Neither was compulsory individuals had to nominate themselves for both selection methods. In particular those chosen by lot were citizens acting without particular expertise. This was almost inevitable since with the notable exception of the generals strategoi each office had restrictive term limits. For example a citizen could only be a member of the Boule in two nonconsecutive years in their life. 75 In addition there were some limitations on who could hold office. Age restrictions were in place with thirty years as a minimum rendering about a third of the adult citizen body ineligible at any one time. An unknown proportion of citizens were also subject to disenfranchisement atimia excluding some of them permanently and others temporarily depending on the type. Furthermore all citizens selected were reviewed before taking up office dokimasia at which time they might be disqualified. While citizens voting in the assembly were free of review or punishment those same citizens when holding an office served the people and could be punished very severely. In addition to being subject to review prior to holding office officeholders were also subject to an examination after leaving office euthunai straightenings or submission of accounts to review their performance. Both of these processes were in most cases brief and formulaic but they opened up the possibility of a contest before a jury court if some citizen wanted to take a matter up. 76 In the case of scrutiny going to trial there was the risk for the former officeholder of suffering severe penalties. Even during his period of office any officeholder could be impeached and removed from office by the assembly. In each of the ten main meetings kuriai ekklesiai a year the question was explicitly raised in the assembly agenda were the office holders carrying out their duties correctly? Citizens active as officeholders served in a quite different capacity from when they voted in the assembly or served as jurors. By and large the power exercised by these officials was routine administration and quite limited. These officeholders were the agents of the people not their representatives so their role was that of administration rather than governing. The powers of officials were precisely defined and their capacity for initiative limited. When it came to penal sanctions no officeholder could impose a fine over fifty drachmas. Anything higher had to go before a court. Competence does not seem to have been the main issue but rather at least in the 4th century BC whether they were loyal democrats or had oligarchic tendencies. Part of the ethos of democracy rather was the building of general competence by ongoing involvement. In the 5th century setup the ten annually elected generals were often very prominent but for those who had power it lay primarily in their frequent speeches and in the respect accorded them in the assembly rather than their vested powers. The allotment of an individual was based on citizenship rather than merit or any form of personal popularity which could be bought. Allotment therefore was seen as a means to prevent the corrupt purchase of votes and it gave citizens political equality as all had an equal chance of obtaining government office. This also acted as a check against demagoguery though this check was imperfect and did not prevent elections from involving pandering to voters. 77  The random assignment of responsibility to individuals who may or may not be competent has obvious risks but the system included features meant to mitigate possible problems. Athenians selected for office served as teams boards panels. In a group one person is more likely to know the right way to do things and those that do not may learn from those that do. During the period of holding a particular office everyone on the team would be observing everybody else as a sort of check. However there were officials such as the nine archons who while seemingly a board carried out very different functions from each other. No office appointed by lot could be held twice by the same individual. The only exception was the boule or council of 500. In this case simply by demographic necessity an individual could serve twice in a lifetime. This principle extended down to the secretaries and undersecretaries who served as assistants to magistrates such as the archons. To the Athenians it seems what had to be guarded against was not incompetence but any tendency to use the office as a way of accumulating ongoing power. 78  During an Athenian election approximately one hundred officials out of a thousand were elected rather than chosen by lot. There were two main categories in this group those required to handle large sums of money and the 10 generals the strategoi. One reason that financial officials were elected was that any money embezzled could be recovered from their estates election in general strongly favoured the rich but in this case wealth was virtually a prerequisite. Generals were elected not only because their role required expert knowledge but also because they needed to be people with experience and contacts in the wider Greek world where wars were fought. In the 5th century BC principally as seen through the figure of Pericles the generals could be among the most powerful people in the polis. Yet in the case of Pericles it is wrong to see his power as coming from his long series of annual generalships each year along with nine others. His officeholding was rather an expression and a result of the influence he wielded. That influence was based on his relation with the assembly a relation that in the first instance lay simply in the right of any citizen to stand and speak before the people. Under the 4th century version of democracy the roles of general and of key political speaker in the assembly tended to be filled by different persons. In part this was a consequence of the increasingly specialized forms of warfare practiced in the later period. Elected officials too were subject to review before holding office and scrutiny after office. And they could also be removed from office at any time that the assembly met. There was even a death penalty for inadequate performance while in office. 79  Athenian democracy had many critics both ancient and modern. Ancient Greek critics of Athenian democracy include Thucydides the general and historian Aristophanes the playwright Plato the pupil of Socrates Aristotle the pupil of Plato and a writer known as the Old Oligarch. While modern critics are more likely to find fault with the restrictive qualifications for political involvement these ancients viewed democracy as being too inclusive. For them the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and were likely to make huge mistakes. 80 According to Samons The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought government or society must confront this strange paradox the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime on a philosophical or theoretical level. And what is more the actual history of Athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures mistakes and misdeeds most infamously the execution of Socrates that would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good government. 81  Thucydides from his aristocratic and historical viewpoint reasoned that a serious flaw in democratic government was that the common people were often much too credulous about even contemporary facts to rule justly in contrast to his own criticalhistorical approach to history. For example he points to errors regarding Sparta Athenians erroneously believed that Spartas kings each had two votes in their ruling council and that there existed a Spartan battalion called Pitanate lochos. To Thucydides this carelessness was due to common peoples preference for readymade accounts. 82  Similarly Plato and Aristotle criticized democratic rule as the numerically preponderant poor tyrannizing the rich. Instead of seeing it as a fair system under which everyone has equal rights they regarded it as manifestly unjust. In Aristotles works this is categorized as the difference between arithmetic and geometric i.e. proportional equality. 83 80  To its ancient detractors rule by the demos was also reckless and arbitrary. Two examples demonstrate this While Plato blamed democracy for killing Socrates his criticisms of the rule of the demos were much more extensive. Much of his writings were about his alternatives to democracy. His The Republic The Statesman and Laws contained many arguments against democratic rule and in favour of a much narrower form of government The organization of the city must be confided to those who possess knowledge who alone can enable their fellowcitizens to attain virtue and therefore excellence by means of education. 86  Whether the democratic failures should be seen as systemic or as a product of the extreme conditions of the Peloponnesian war there does seem to have been a move toward correction. 87 A new version of democracy was established in 403 BC but it can be linked with both earlier and subsequent reforms graph paran m n 416 BC end of assembly trials 355 BC. For instance the system of nomothesia was introduced. In this A new law might be proposed by any citizen. Any proposal to modify an existing law had to be accompanied by a proposed replacement law. The citizen making the proposal had to publish it in advance publication consisted of writing the proposal on a whitened board located next to the statues of the Eponymous Heroes in the agora. The proposal would be considered by the Council and would be placed on the agenda of the Assembly in the form of a motion. If the Assembly voted in favor of the proposed change the proposal would be referred for further consideration by a group of citizens called nomothetai literally establishers of the law. 25  Increasingly responsibility was shifted from the assembly to the courts with laws being made by jurors and all assembly decisions becoming reviewable by courts. That is to say the mass meeting of all citizens lost some ground to gatherings of a thousand or so which were under oath and with more time to focus on just one matter though never more than a day. One downside to this change was that the new democracy was less capable of responding quickly in times where quick decisive action was needed. Another tack of criticism is to notice the disquieting links between democracy and a number of less than appealing features of Athenian life. Although democracy predated Athenian imperialism by over thirty years they are sometimes associated with each other. For much of the 5th century at least democracy fed off an empire of subject states. Thucydides the son of Milesias not the historian an aristocrat stood in opposition to these policies for which he was ostracised in 443 BC. At times the imperialist democracy acted with extreme brutality as in the decision to execute the entire male population of Melos and sell off its women and children simply for refusing to become subjects of Athens. The common people were numerically dominant in the navy which they used to pursue their own interests in the form of work as rowers and in the hundreds of overseas administrative positions. Furthermore they used the income from empire to fund payment for officeholding. This is the position set out by the antidemocratic pamphlet known whose anonymous author is often called the Old Oligarch. This writer also called pseudoXenophon produced several comments critical of democracy such as 88  Aristotle also wrote about what he considered to be a better form of government than democracy. Rather than any citizen partaking with an equal share in the rule he thought that those who were more virtuous should have greater power in governance. 89  A case can be made that discriminatory lines came to be drawn more sharply under Athenian democracy than before or elsewhere in particular in relation to women and slaves as well as in the line between citizens and noncitizens. By so strongly validating one role that of the male citizen it has been argued that democracy compromised the status of those who did not share it. Since the 19th century the Athenian version of democracy has been seen by one group who? as a goal yet to be achieved by modern societies. They want representative democracy to be added to or even replaced by direct democracy in the Athenian way perhaps by utilizing electronic democracy. Another group who? on the other hand considers that since many Athenians were not allowed to participate in its government Athenian democracy was not a democracy at all. Comparisons with Athens will continue to be made as long as societies keep striving to realize democracy under modern conditions and their successes and failures are discussed. 93  Greek philosopher and activist Takis Fotopoulos has argued that the final failure of Athenian democracy was not due as it is usually asserted by its critics to the innate contradictions of democracy itself but on the contrary to the fact that the Athenian democracy never matured to become an inclusive democracy. This cannot be adequately explained by simply referring to the immature objective conditions the low development of productive forces and so on important as may be because the same objective conditions prevailed at that time in many other places all over the Mediterranean let alone the rest of Greece but democracy flourished only in Athens . 94  Since the middle of the 20th century most countries have claimed to be democratic regardless of the actual composition of their governments. Yet after the demise of Athenian democracy few looked upon it as a good form of government. citation needed No legitimation of that rule was formulated to counter the negative accounts of Plato and Aristotle who saw it as the rule of the poor who plundered the rich. Democracy came to be viewed as a collective tyranny. Well into the 18th century democracy was consistently condemned. Sometimes mixed constitutions evolved with democratic elements but it definitely did not mean selfrule by citizens. 95  It would be misleading to say that the tradition of Athenian democracy was an important part of the 18thcentury revolutionaries intellectual background. The classical example that inspired the American and French revolutionaries as well as English radicals was Rome rather than Greece and in the age of Cicero and Caesar Rome was a republic but not a democracy. Thus the Founding Fathers of the United States who met in Philadelphia in 1787 did not set up a Council of the Areopagos but a Senate that eventually met on the Capitol. 96 Following Rousseau 1712 1778 democracy came to be associated with popular sovereignty instead of popular participation in the exercise of power. Several German philosophers and poets took delight in what they saw as the fullness of life in ancient Athens and not long afterwards English liberals put forward a new argument in favor of the Athenians. In opposition thinkers such as Samuel Johnson were worried about the ignorance of democratic decisionmaking bodies but Macaulay and John Stuart Mill and George Grote saw the great strength of the Athenian democracy in the high level of cultivation that citizens enjoyed and called for improvements in the educational system of Britain that would make possible a shared civic consciousness parallel to that achieved by the ancient Athenians. 97  George Grote claimed in his History of Greece 1846 1856 that Athenian democracy was neither the tyranny of the poor nor the rule of the mob. He argued that only by giving every citizen the vote would people ensure that the state would be run in the general interest. Later and until the end of World War Il democracy became dissociated from its ancient frame of reference. After that it was not just one of the many possible ways in which political rule could be organised. Instead it became the only possible political system in an egalitarian society. 98 ,

Democracy is a system of government in which laws policies leadership and major undertakings of a state or other polity are directly or indirectly decided by the people a group historically constituted by only a minority of the population e.g. all free adult males in ancient Athens or all sufficiently propertied adult males in 19thcentury Britain but generally understood since the mid20th century to include all or nearly all adult citizens. Studies of contemporary nonliterate tribal societies and other evidence suggest that democracy broadly speaking was practiced within tribes of huntergatherers in prehistoric times. The transition to settled agricultural communities led to inequalities of wealth and power between and within communities and hierarchical nondemocratic forms of social organization. Thousands of years later in the 6th century BCE a relatively democratic form of government was introduced in the citystate of Athens by Cleisthenes. States with democratic governments prevent rule by autocrats guarantee fundamental individual rights allow for a relatively high level of political equality and rarely make war on each other. As compared with nondemocratic states they also better foster human development as measured by indicators such as health and education provide more prosperity for their citizens and ensure a broader range of personal freedoms.  The hallmark of democracy is that it permits citizens to participate in making laws and public policies by regularly choosing their leaders and by voting in assemblies or referenda. If their participation is to be meaningful and effective if the democracy is to be real and not a sham citizens must understand their own interests know the relevant facts and have the ability to critically evaluate political arguments. Each of those things presupposes education. democracy literally rule by the people. The term is derived from the Greek d mokratia which was coined from d mos people and kratos rule in the middle of the 5th century bce to denote the political systems then existing in some Greek citystates notably Athens. Read Madeleine Albright s Britannica essay on democracy. The etymological origins of the term democracy hint at a number of urgent problems that go far beyond semantic issues. If a government of or by the people a popular government is to be established at least five fundamental questions must be confronted at the outset and two more are almost certain to be posed if the democracy continues to exist for long. 1 What is the appropriate unit or association within which a democratic government should be established? A town or city? A country? A business corporation? A university? An international organization? All of these? 2 Given an appropriate association a city for example who among its members should enjoy full citizenship? Which persons in other words should constitute the d mos? Is every member of the association entitled to participate in governing it? Assuming that children should not be allowed to participate as most adults would agree should the d mos include all adults? If it includes only a subset of the adult population how small can the subset be before the association ceases to be a democracy and becomes something else such as an aristocracy government by the best aristos or an oligarchy government by the few oligos? 3 Assuming a proper association and a proper d mos how are citizens to govern? What political organizations or institutions will they need? Will these institutions differ between different kinds of associations for example a small town and a large country? 4 When citizens are divided on an issue as they often will be whose views should prevail and in what circumstances? Should a majority always prevail or should minorities sometimes be empowered to block or overcome majority rule? 5 If a majority is ordinarily to prevail what is to constitute a proper majority? A majority of all citizens? A majority of voters? Should a proper majority comprise not individual citizens but certain groups or associations of citizens such as hereditary groups or territorial associations? 6 The preceding questions presuppose an adequate answer to a sixth and even more important question Why should the people rule? Is democracy really better than aristocracy or monarchy? Perhaps as Plato argues in the Republic the best government would be led by a minority of the most highly qualified persons an aristocracy of philosopherkings. What reasons could be given to show that Plato s view is wrong? 7 No association could maintain a democratic government for very long if a majority of the d mos or a majority of the government believed that some other form of government were better. Thus a minimum condition for the continued existence of a democracy is that a substantial proportion of both the d mos and the leadership believes that popular government is better than any feasible alternative. What conditions in addition to this one favour the continued existence of democracy? What conditions are harmful to it? Why have some democracies managed to endure even through periods of severe crisis while so many others have collapsed?,

Actually the guessing game is over the weddings have begun as have weird attempts to circumvent our constitutional democracy. Thomas Piketty raised the Big Questions this year about democracy and inequality. Piketty only waves his hands around the allimportant question of whether economic inequality undermines democracy. He was so zealous a partisan of democracy and of Cromwell that the authorities frequently placed him in a straight jacket. I have a strong reverence for traditions and no taste whatever for democracy that would be too long a step. Democracy let us grant it is the best system of government as yet operative in this world of sin. I had long ago adopted democracy as a good policy so now I stopped to introduce myself. He based this plan upon the premise that democracy would be more successful if greater numbers of individuals were educated. Democracy is a system of government where the citizens of a state exercise power to rule the state either directly or through electing representatives. Democracy can refer to a system of government or to a particular state that employs this system. The word entered English around the 1570s from the Middle French d mocratie but it originally comes via Latin from the ancient Greek demokratia which literally means rule kratos by the people demos. The Greek demokratia dates all the way back to the 5th century b.c. when it was used to describe the government in some citystates notably Athens. There are two kinds of democracy direct and representative. Direct democracy is when the people are directly involved in governing the state. Representative democracy which characterizes the U.S. system occurs when people elect representatives to ensure their interests in government. When we think of democracy today we usually think of a representative one in which all or most people are able to participate. This concept didn t originate until a very long time after democracy s ancient roots. In 507 b.c. Cleisthenes the leader of Athens introduced a series of reforms designed to allow the people to have a voice in ruling the city. It included three different political bodies the governors the council of representatives and the courts. Only male citizens over the age of eighteen could vote excluding those from outside the city slaves and all women. This system of government lasted until around the 400 b.c. when it began to waver with conquests by neighbors gradually weakening it further. Athenian democracy was probably not the first example of democracy in the ancient world but it is the bestknown early version and it is from here that we draw the word and its governmental philosophy. Another wellknown example of early democracy was the Roman Republic. Like Athens it wasn t what we would think of today as a full democracy. Again only adult male citizens were eligible to participate. Italy continued the tradition in a few of its medieval citybased republics. Venice and Florence particularly had governmental systems that included political participation by the people if in a limited way. Democracy also found its way into monarchical European states through the concept of the parliament which was a council that advised the monarch. For the most part only those who already had power could participate in parliaments though Sweden allowed peasants to participate in its council the Riksdag starting in the 15th century. The Enlightenment in the 17th and 18th centuries brought a greater questioning of established authority to mainstream philosophy and discourse. This trend had a strong impact on the fledgling United States which when it won its independence from Great Britain in 1783 set up a system of representative democracy to represent its people. France was also impacted by this model. The French Revolution in 1789 was an attempt to achieve democracy though the country didn t achieve it until the mid1800s. It was not until the 20th century that universal or broader suffrage or the right to vote was extended in most countries and it was in the 20th century that democracy spread. By the beginning of the 21st century almost half of the countries of the world had some variety of democratic or neardemocratic system. Types of democracies are classified according to various distinguishing features including constitutional democracy democratic socialism Jeffersonian democracy liberal democracy parliamentary democracy or presidential democracy to name a few. Democracy is also used for nongovernmental organizational systems such as a workplace democracy which applies democratic principles in professional contexts. An advocate of democracy or democratic values is called a democrat not to be confused with a member of the U.S. Democratic party.  When it comes to countering terrorism refusing to allow our democracy and liberty to be undermined is just as important as discussing the immediate security situation.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/democracy/The-theory-of-democracy, In a funeral oration in 430 bce for those who had fallen in the Peloponnesian War the Athenian leader Pericles described democratic Athens as the school of Hellas. Among the city s many exemplary qualities he declared was its constitution which favors the many instead of the few this is why it is called a democracy. Pericles continued If we look to the laws they afford equal justice to all in their private differences if to social standing advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit nor again does poverty bar the way if a man is able to serve the state he is not hindered by obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life.  A century later Aristotle discussed democracy in terms that would become highly influential in comparative studies of political systems. At the heart of his approach is the notion of a constitution which he defines as an organization of offices which all the citizens distribute among themselves according to the power which different classes possess. He concludes that there must therefore be as many forms of government as there are modes of arranging the offices according to the superiorities and the differences of the parts of the state. Ever the realist however he remarks that the best government is often unattainable and therefore the true legislator and statesman ought to be acquainted not only with 1 that which is best in the abstract but also with 2 that which is best relatively to circumstances.  Aristotle identifies three kinds of ideal constitution each of which describes a situation in which those who rule pursue the common good and three corresponding kinds of perverted constitution each of which describes a situation in which those who rule pursue narrow and selfish goals. The three kinds of constitution both ideal and perverted are differentiated by the number of persons they allow to rule. Thus rule by one is monarchy in its ideal form and tyranny in its perverted form see tyrant rule by the few is aristocracy in its ideal form and oligarchy in its perverted form and rule by the many is polity in its ideal form and democracy in its perverted form. Aristotle s general scheme prevailed for more than two millennia though his unsympathetic and puzzling definition of democracy which probably did not reflect the views of most Greeks in his time did not. Aristotle himself took a more favourable view of democracy in his studies of the variety stability and composition of actual democratic governments. In his observation that the basis of a democratic state is liberty Aristotle proposed a connection between the ideas of democracy and liberty that would be strongly emphasized by all later advocates of democracy. Nearly 20 centuries after Aristotle the English philosopher John Locke adopted the essential elements of the Aristotelian classification of constitutions in his Second Treatise of Civil Government 1690. Unlike Aristotle however Locke was an unequivocal supporter of political equality individual liberty democracy and majority rule. Although his work was naturally rather abstract and not particularly programmatic it provided a powerful philosophical foundation for much later democratic theorizing and political programs.,
