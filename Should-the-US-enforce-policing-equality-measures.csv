https://eji.org/issues/policing-in-america/,  124 results for Prison  In EJI s work representing people who are vulnerable marginalized and condemned we directly witness and confront biased and violent policing that has targeted Black communities for generations. We have long believed that poverty is criminalized in America where the justice system treats you better if you are rich and guilty than if you are poor and innocent. The U.S. has the highest incarceration rate in the world. Over the last five decades our country has criminalized an increasing number of behaviors and targeted Black communities and communities of color for overpolicing and aggressive prosecution. We treat people who are suffering from drug addiction and mental illness as criminals instead of recognizing that such problems require a healthcare response. Our country incarcerates hundreds of thousands of people who are not a threat to public safety and who should be released so that the billions of dollars spent on jails and prisons can be redirected to actually improving community health and enhancing public safety by addressing the conditions that create harm. Currently the entire system of policing prosecution punishment and incarceration is a barrier to creating a just and safe society. People living in poverty the marginalized and communities of color want and deserve effective strategies that reduce crime and provide support and hope to residents. EJI has previously supported proposals for incremental steps that could be taken. For over 30 years we have represented society s most vulnerable people including people sentenced to execution and children sentenced to die in prison and we have seen even incremental changes make life or death differences. In advocating for these clients we have embraced a range of interventions that reduce harm while always believing in the need for broader systemic change to how we approach public safety. And the momentum of today s movement has opened a window of possibility for deeper change in many communities. Law enforcement agencies have outsized budgets while other vital community services are underfunded. In too many places police engage in patterns and practices that undermine public safety and create harm. Police officers are asked to respond to issues that they are not equipped or trained to address. Approaching health care emergencies substance abuse issues mental illness and homelessness with a law and order orientation is ineffective and too frequently results in police violence and avoidable injury and death. As even some law enforcement officers acknowledge we must reimagine public safety and community health reallocate funds from traditional policing to services that promote public safety and more effectively address the conditions that create poverty inequality and community distress. But to meaningfully reduce the role of police we must also confront the central problem of racial inequality in America. The presumption of dangerousness and guilt that has been assigned to Black people as a result of our long history of racial inequality must be uprooted in order to address the horrific acts of racial violence we have recently witnessed. Mary Turner was eight months pregnant when she was lynched by white men in Georgia because she had complained about her husband s murder. The spectacle of her body hanging from a tree while the bloody corpse of her unborn child lay on the ground was insufficient to cause this nation to hold people accountable for her murder because she was Black. Thousands of Black people were lynched by white mobs often with the support and involvement of local police and our government did nothing. A half century after Emmett Till was killed by white men who grinned and bragged about his murder with impunity we have not effectively addressed the racism that feeds this violence. Trayvon Martin and Ahmaud Arbery were not killed by the police but their deaths reveal the threat posed by unaddressed racism. America has been acculturated to accept racially motivated lethal violence against Black people and that must end. The deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd make clear that when racism is shielded with a badge and immunity made more dangerous with a gun and the authority to kill policing becomes a source of danger and threat rather than a solution. But there can be no effective strategy to address policing without a broader reckoning with our history of racial injustice and white supremacy. This will mean systemic changes in many spheres. People of color are often mistreated by health care professionals subjected to discrimination by social service agencies and menaced by neighborhood groups. Black children are unfairly targeted and punished by teachers and school administrators resulting in suspensions and expulsions that create despair and trauma. The system of policing and incarceration evolved as a way to maintain racial hierarchy after the Civil War. We will eliminate the scourge of police violence and abuse only if we address the centrality of racial injustice and inequality in America. Because the United States did not commit to racial equality slavery did not end in 1865 it evolved into convict leasing and de cades of racial terror lynchings. Without an explicit commitment to ending racial injustice and the narratives that sustain it law enforcement and other forms of racial control and mistreatment will continue. Many existing social service institutions already operate in ways that perpetuate racial inequality. Eliminating racism rooting out white supremacy and dismantling the racial hierarchy that persists as a legacy of our history must be an explicit and central goal of any meaningful conversation about policing and the treatment of Black people in this country. Public safety and public health in America cannot be advanced without confronting racism. Our nation is burdened with a history of racial injustice that must be acknowledged and addressed. EJI believes that this moment requires nothing less than a new era of Truth and Justice.  122 Commerce Street Montgomery AL 36104 334 2691803 email protected

Policy. Our criminal justice system must respect the dignity and rights of all persons and adhere to our fundamental obligation to ensure fair and impartial justice for all. This is imperative not only to live up to our principles as a Nation but also to build secure safe and healthy communities. Protecting public safety requires close partnerships between law enforcement and the communities it serves. Public safety therefore depends on public trust and public trust in turn requires that our criminal justice system as a whole embodies fair and equal treatment transparency and accountability. Law enforcement officers are often a person s first point of contact with our criminal justice system and we depend on them to uphold these principles while doing the demanding and often lifethreatening work of keeping us safe. We expect them to help prevent and solve crimes and frequently call upon them to respond to social problems outside their expertise and beyond their intended role diverting attention from their critical public safety mission and increasing the risks of an already dangerous job which has led to the deaths of law enforcement officers and civilians alike. The vast majority of law enforcement officers do these difficult jobs with honor and integrity and they work diligently to uphold the law and preserve the public s trust. Yet there are places in America today particularly in Black and Brown communities and other communities of color where the bonds of trust are frayed or broken. We have collectively mourned following law enforcement encounters that have tragically ended in the loss of life. To heal as a Nation we must acknowledge that those fatal encounters have disparately impacted Black and Brown people and other people of color. The pain of the families of those who have been killed is magnified when expectations for accountability go unmet and the echoes of their losses reverberate across generations. More broadly numerous aspects of our criminal justice system are still shaped by race or ethnicity. It is time that we acknowledge the legacy of systemic racism in our criminal justice system and work together to eliminate the racial disparities that endure to this day. Doing so serves all Americans.  Through this order my Administration is taking a critical step in what must be part of a larger effort to strengthen our democracy and advance the principles of equality and dignity. While we can make policing safer and more effective by strengthening trust between law enforcement officers and the communities they serve we must also reform our broader criminal justice system so that it protects and serves all people equally. To be clear certain obstacles to lasting reform require legislative solutions. In particular systemwide change requires funding and support that only the Congress can authorize. But my Administration will use its full authority to take action including through the implementation of this order to build and sustain fairness and accountability throughout the criminal justice system.  The need for such action could not be more urgent. Since early 2020 communities around the country have faced rising rates of violent crime requiring law enforcement engagement at a time when law enforcement agencies are already confronting the challenges of staffing shortages and low morale. Strengthening community trust is more critical now than ever as a community s cooperation with the police to report crimes and assist investigations is essential for deterring violence and holding perpetrators accountable. Reinforcing the partnership between law enforcement and communities is imperative for combating crime and achieving lasting public safety.  It is therefore the policy of my Administration to increase public trust and enhance public safety and security by encouraging equitable and communityoriented policing. We must commit to new practices in law enforcement recruitment hiring promotion and retention as well as training oversight and accountability. Insufficient resources including those dedicated to support officer wellness needed more than ever as officers confront rising crime and the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 COVID19 pandemic jeopardize the law enforcement community s ability to build and retain a highly qualified and diverse professional workforce. We must work together to ensure that law enforcement agencies have the resources they need as well as the capacity to attract hire and retain the best personnel including resources to institute screening mechanisms to identify unqualified applicants and to support officers in meeting the stresses and challenges of the job. We must also ensure that law enforcement agencies reflect the communities they serve protect all community members equally and offer comprehensive training and development opportunities to line officers and supervisors alike.  Building trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they are sworn to protect and serve also requires accountability for misconduct and transparency through data collection and public reporting. It requires proactive measures to prevent profiling based on actual or perceived race ethnicity national origin religion sex including sexual orientation and gender identity or disability including by ensuring that new law enforcement technologies do not exacerbate disparities based on these characteristics. It includes ending discriminatory pretextual stops and offering support for evidenceinformed innovative responses to people with substance use disorders people with mental health needs veterans people with disabilities vulnerable youth people who are victims of domestic violence sexual assault or trafficking and people experiencing homelessness or living in poverty. It calls for improving and clarifying standards for police activities such as the execution of search warrants and the use of force.  Many law enforcement agencies across the country including at the Federal State Tribal local and territorial level have already undertaken important efforts to modernize policing and make our broader criminal justice system more effective and more equitable. Their work has inspired many of the provisions of this order. These agencies and the officers who serve within them deserve recognition for their leadership and appreciation for setting a standard that others can follow. This order seeks to recognize these key reforms and implement them consistently across Federal law enforcement agencies. Through this order the Federal Government will also seek to provide State Tribal local and territorial law enforcement agencies with the guidance and support they need to advance their own efforts to strengthen public trust and improve public safety.  It is also the policy of my Administration to ensure that conditions of confinement are safe and humane and that those who are incarcerated are not subjected to unnecessary or excessive uses of force are free from prolonged segregation and have access to quality health care including substance use disorder care and mental health care. We must provide people who are incarcerated with meaningful opportunities for rehabilitation and the tools and support they need to transition successfully back to society. Individuals who have been involved in the criminal justice system face many barriers in transitioning back into society including limited access to housing public benefits health care traumainformed services and support education nutrition employment and occupational licensing credit the ballot and other critical opportunities. Lowering barriers to reentry is essential to reducing recidivism and reducing crime. Finally no one should be required to serve an excessive prison sentence. When the Congress passed the First Step Act of 2018 Public Law 115391 it sought to relieve people from unfair and unduly harsh sentences including those driven by harsh mandatory minimums and the unjust sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine offenses. My Administration will fully implement the First Step Act including by supporting sentencing reductions in appropriate cases and by allowing eligible incarcerated people to participate in recidivism reduction programming and earn time credits. With these measures together we can strengthen public safety and the bonds of trust between law enforcement and the community and build a criminal justice system that respects the dignity and equality of all in America.

https://www.police1.com/legal/articles/the-flip-side-of-fair-and-impartial-policing-uvB6oHdGYMujCWZR/, Thank you for completing the form here is your download jQuerybody.attrdocName Thank you for completing the form here is the link to your ondemand webinar OnDemand Webinar Link Maybe I have devoted too much of my life to law enforcement and the criminal justice system to not be jaded by much of what I have experienced and continue to see. Maybe I am just getting cranky. Or maybe despite 40 years working in the legal system I still believe in the idea of equal justice. Whatever it may be I do not think I am offbase when pointing out certain inequities in our justice system. While it may not be perfect it is better than most and I will still put my faith in our constitutional system than the alternative. But whenever the Constitution is mentioned in certain circles of law enforcement I am often astounded by the simple misreading of it by those who have sworn to uphold the protections provided within the document specifically the Bill of Rights. Our system of civil liberties depends upon a vigorous defense of those rights which brings me to the concept of fair and impartial policing. This is a familiar term to many police and undoubtedly a topic in training. It emanated from an evidencebased approach to policing focusing on the concept of implicit bias and officer recognition of that bias. The goal of fair and impartial policing is admirable. Law enforcement must consistently be responsive to the public and the varied multiethnic multicultural environments it serves. Some of the basic tenets of fair and impartial policing I have read on police departments websites tout the protection of basic freedoms such as privacy speech assembly and religious practice while also espousing equal treatment of every citizen. The concept is extended to organizational transparency as a means of facilitating trust and confidence within the community. Again these are admirable standards that should be followed by every police agency but there is hypocrisy in these professed policing models that often overlook one class of individuals police officers. In my 20 years of representing law enforcement officers in hundreds of disciplinary matters administrative and courtroom trials critical incidents and grievances I have seen the opposite of fair and impartial policing when applied to internal investigations of alleged misfeasance or misconduct on the part of an officer. While I can attest to many investigations that were fair and impartial and professionally handled I can also attest to many that were not. The latter were plagued by lying supervisors hidden evidence undisclosed documents witnesses who were never interviewed improper ex parte communications with the hearing officer by agency counsel and tampering with an administrative judge s decision and subsequent removal from the case. In one case I handled a potentially exculpatory video was withheld by the agency a supervising officer caught in a lie was allowed to clean up his testimony after the hearing concluded agency attorneys denied the existence of a document created by a highranking officer which thankfully I already had a copy of and my clients were made the scapegoats for a favored supervisor s alleged criminal conduct. During the administrative litigation I was quoted by a local newspaper to the effect of if this was what the agency does to its own how can the public expect to be treated? This is the other side of policing the public does not often see except when the offending agency is hit years later with a civil verdict. That is what happened with my former clients who were referred to a civil rights law firm and after nearly six years of litigation won a several milliondollar verdict for compensatory and punitive damages against their former police agency. A federal jury found there was nothing fair and impartial about the way they were treated. Over the past six years I have spoken with police officers across the country who have been mistreated by their agencies. Careers have been derailed either by lack of advancement or forced resignation because officers have not gone along with a false agency narrative concerning an incident have pointed out corruption acted as whistleblowers or spoken up about sexual harassment gender discrimination and racial discrimination. The stories are not isolated. There are too many of them to not signify a cultural problem with the way some police administrations large and small approach these issues. Sworn police officers and other department employees require the same level of fairness and impartial treatment when subject to investigation as their agency s professed goals of fair and impartial policing toward the public reflects. Smart professional and competent police supervisors and administrators know this and their organizations uphold these standards of consistency. The ones that do not follow these standards find themselves at the wrong end of jury verdicts. The foregoing should be read for what it means to be fair and impartial when investigating and adjudicating internal cases involving police officers and not as some may inaccurately read as an excuse for police misconduct. In a 2017 article The Washington Post investigated police terminations in large U.S. departments since 2006. Of the 1881 officers fired 450 were reinstated after an appeal mandated by the union contract. Nearly 25 of those fired won back their jobs after either an arbitrator s or administrative law judge s review. Most cited reasons were either a procedural error too harsh a punishment for the disciplinary offense failure to interview witnesses lack of evidence or some other agency failure in properly investigating and adjudicating the matter. As noted in the article this sometimes led to the forced reinstatement of guilty officers. However just as the police are expected to properly investigate a case when accusing an individual of a crime otherwise the law provides the accused a remedy under the law so too do the rules apply when seeking to deny an officer a property right to continued employment. More recently in a 2020 website article on police accountability the Innocence Project noted that complex laws policies and contracts have consistently shielded law enforcement and allowed them to act with effective immunity. These protections stand in stark and perverse contrast to the policies that ensnare innocent citizens at the earliest stages of a wrongful conviction. What the article fails to acknowledge is the way in which the same laws and policies have prevented wrongly terminated police officers from being able to effectively vindicate themselves. Many of these officers have been the good ones who have pointed out wrongdoing but were sacrificed at the altar of department politics. Not all officers are as lucky as those who have received substantial sevenfigure verdicts after years of litigation. In cases involving a police officer it is wise for police administrators to realize the protections of the constitution apply to them and that property rights embedded in an officer s interest in continued employment cannot be deprived without due process of law. This includes representation by counsel. Some of those who espouse fair and impartial policing toward the public seem to ignore this fundamental right when overseeing matters impacting police officer rights. It may be time to reckon with the face in the mirror. NEXT Officer scores a victory for Brady list due process other states and prosecutors should follow suit
https://www.aclu.org/news/criminal-law-reform/defunding-the-police-will-actually-make-us-safer, This OpEd first appeared on Cosmopolitan. Almost exactly six years after NYPD officers murdered Eric Garner in New York City Minneapolis police officers murdered George Floyd. Activists advocates and protestors are still screaming I can t breathe and begging government officials for police reform that will end police violence in Black communities. But today s demands are bigger and bolder Now protesters are advocating for systemic changes that require a complete reimagining of law enforcement in the United States. American policing has never been a neutral institution. The first U.S. city police department was a slave patrol and modern police forces have directed oppression and violence at Black people to enforce Jim Crow wage the War on Drugs and crack down on protests. When people ask for police reform many are actually asking for this oppressive system to be dismantled and to invest in institutions resources and services that help communities grow and thrive. That s why many protestors and activists following in the footsteps of Blackled grassroots groups are demanding immediate defunding of police departments. The idea of defunding or divestment is new to some folks but the basic premise is simple We must cut the astronomical amount of money that our governments spend on law enforcement and give that money to more helpful services like job training counseling and violenceprevention programs. Each year state and local governments spend upward of 100 billion dollars on law enforcement and that s excluding billions more in federal grants and resources. Budgets are not created in a vacuum. They can be changed through targeted advocacy and organizing. We can demand that our local officials including city council members and mayors stop allocating funds for the police to acquire more militarized equipment and instead ask for that money to go toward communityrun violenceprevention programs. We can demand that our federal government redirect the money that funds police presence in schools to putting counselors in schools instead. Funneling so many resources into law enforcement instead of education affordable housing and accessible health care has caused significant harm to communities. Police violence is actually a leading cause of death for Black men A recent study found that 1 in 1000 Black men can expect to be killed by police and public health experts have described police violence as a serious public health issue. For a country like ours which considers itself a modern democracy that pushes ideals of freedom and justice for all that number should be truly shocking. Much of the work police do is merely engage in the daily harassment of Black communities for minor crimes or crimes of poverty that shouldn t be criminalized in the first place. Consider this Out of the 10.3 million arrests made per year only 5 percent are for the most serious offenses including murder rape and aggravated assault. These are the ones that truly threaten public safety. The other 95 percent of arrests are for things like traffic violations marijuana possession unlawful assembly and even removing a shopping cart from store premises. That means that police spend the most resources going after minor incidents that actually don t threaten everyday life but do lead to mass criminalization and incarceration. And as you know some arrests are made for doing nothing at all beyond being Black. We have little evidence if any to show that more police surveillance results in fewer crimes and greater public safety. Indeed funneling police into communities of color and pushing officers to make arrests just perpetuates harm and trauma. Yet since the 1980s spending on law enforcement and our criminal legal system has dramatically outpaced that in community services such as housing education and violence prevention programs. Those are the institutions that help build stable safe and healthy communities. For example Los Angeles s budget gives police 3.14 billion out of the city s 10.5 billion. Spending on community services such as economic development 30 million and housing 81 million pale in comparison to the massive LAPD budget. On Wednesday night after years of Black Lives Matter grassroots activists demanding a cut in LAPD s budget Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced he would cut 100 million to 150 million from the LAPD budget and reinvest those funds in communities of color. Similarly in New York City the government spends almost 6 billion on policing which is more than it does on the Department of Health Homeless Services Housing Preservation and Development and Youth and Community development combined. By shrinking their massive budgets we can help end decades of racially driven social control and oppression as well as address social problems at their root instead of investing in an institution that further oppresses and terrorizes communities. In addition to divesting from police and reinvesting the savings in nonpunitive programs that benefit public safety and health there are other critical steps we need to take to foster the systemic change people across the country are calling for For too long the focus on police reform has been dominated by reforms that try to reduce the harms of policing rather than rethink the overall role of police in society. But six years after the Black Lives Matter movement rose to national attention activists across the country are coming together to demand what many have known has been the solution all along defund the police.
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2020/06/03/10-things-we-know-about-race-and-policing-in-the-u-s/, A demonstrator holds her hands up while kneeling in front of police at City Hall in Anaheim California on June 1 2020 during a peaceful protest over the death of George Floyd. Apu GomesAFP via Getty ImagesDays of protests across the United States in the wake of George Floyd s death in the custody of Minneapolis police have brought new attention to questions about police officers attitudes toward black Americans protesters and others. The public s views of the police in turn are also in the spotlight. Here s a roundup of Pew Research Center survey findings from the past few years about the intersection of race and law enforcement. Most of the findings in this post were drawn from two previous Pew Research Center reports one on police officers and policing issues published in January 2017 and one on the state of race relations in the United States published in April 2019. We also drew from a September 2016 report on how black and white Americans view police in their communities. The questions asked for these reports as well as their responses can be found in the reports accompanying topline file or files. The 2017 police report was based on two surveys. One was of 7917 law enforcement officers from 54 police and sheriff s departments across the U.S. designed and weighted to represent the population of officers who work in agencies that employ at least 100 fulltime sworn law enforcement officers with general arrest powers and conducted between May and August 2016. The other survey of the general public was conducted via the Center s American Trends Panel ATP in August and September 2016 among 4538 respondents. The 2016 report on how blacks and whites view police in their communities also was based on that survey. More information on methodology is available here. The 2019 race report was based on a survey conducted in January and February 2019. A total of 6637 people responded out of 9402 who were sampled for a response rate of 71. The respondents included 5599 from the ATP and oversamples of 530 nonHispanic black and 508 Hispanic respondents sampled from Ipsos KnowledgePanel. More information on methodology is available here. Majorities of both black and white Americans say black people are treated less fairly than whites in dealing with the police and by the criminal justice system as a whole. In a 2019 Center survey 84 of black adults said that in dealing with police blacks are generally treated less fairly than whites 63 of whites said the same. Similarly 87 of blacks and 61 of whites said the U.S. criminal justice system treats black people less fairly. Black adults are about five times as likely as whites to say they ve been unfairly stopped by police because of their race or ethnicity 44 vs. 9 according to the same survey. Black men are especially likely to say this 59 say they ve been unfairly stopped versus 31 of black women. White Democrats and white Republicans have vastly different views of how black people are treated by police and the wider justice system. Overwhelming majorities of white Democrats say black people are treated less fairly than whites by the police 88 and the criminal justice system 86 according to the 2019 poll. About fourinten white Republicans agree 43 and 39 respectively. Nearly twothirds of black adults 65 say they ve been in situations where people acted as if they were suspicious of them because of their race or ethnicity while only a quarter of white adults say that s happened to them. Roughly a third of both Asian and Hispanic adults 34 and 37 respectively say they ve been in such situations the 2019 survey found. Black Americans are far less likely than whites to give police high marks for the way they do their jobs. In a 2016 survey only about a third of black adults said that police in their community did an excellent or good job in using the right amount of force 33 compared with 75 of whites treating racial and ethnic groups equally 35 vs. 75 and holding officers accountable for misconduct 31 vs. 70. In the past police officers and the general public have tended to view fatal encounters between black people and police very differently. In a 2016 survey of nearly 8000 policemen and women from departments with at least 100 officers twothirds said most such encounters are isolated incidents and not signs of broader problems between police and the black community. In a companion survey of more than 4500 U.S. adults 60 of the public called such incidents signs of broader problems between police and black people. But the views given by police themselves were sharply differentiated by race A majority of black officers 57 said that such incidents were evidence of a broader problem but only 27 of white officers and 26 of Hispanic officers said so. Around twothirds of police officers 68 said in 2016 that the demonstrations over the deaths of black people during encounters with law enforcement were motivated to a great extent by antipolice bias only 10 said in a separate question that protesters were primarily motivated by a genuine desire to hold police accountable for their actions. Here as elsewhere police officers views differed by race Only about a quarter of white officers 27 but around sixinten of their black colleagues 57 said such protests were motivated at least to some extent by a genuine desire to hold police accountable. White police officers and their black colleagues have starkly different views on fundamental questions regarding the situation of blacks in American society the 2016 survey found. For example nearly all white officers 92 but only 29 of their black colleagues said the U.S. had made the changes needed to assure equal rights for blacks. A majority of officers said in 2016 that relations between the police in their department and black people in the community they serve were excellent 8 or good 47. However far higher shares saw excellent or good community relations with whites 91 Asians 88 and Hispanics 70. About a quarter of police officers 26 said relations between police and black people in their community were only fair while nearly oneinfive 18 said they were poor with black officers far more likely than others to say so. These percentages are based on only those officers who offered a rating. An overwhelming majority of police officers 86 said in 2016 that highprofile fatal encounters between black people and police officers had made their jobs harder. Sizable majorities also said such incidents had made their colleagues more worried about safety 93 heightened tensions between police and blacks 75 and left many officers reluctant to use force when appropriate 76 or to question people who seemed suspicious 72.

https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2021/02/solving-racial-disparities-in-policing/, Protesters take a knee in front of New York City police officers during a solidarity rally for George Floyd June 4 2020.  Unequal is a multipart series highlighting the work of Harvard faculty staff students alumni and researchers on issues of race and inequality across the U.S. The first part explores the experience of people of color with the criminal justice legal system in America. It seems there s no end to them. They are the recent videos and reports of Black and brown people beaten or killed by law enforcement officers and they have fueled a national outcry over the disproportionate use of excessive and often lethal force against people of color and galvanized demands for police reform. This is not the first time in recent decades that highprofile police violence from the 1991 beating of Rodney King to the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in 2014 ignited calls for change. But this time appears different. The police killings of Breonna Taylor in March George Floyd in May and a string of others triggered historic widespread marches and rallies across the nation from small towns to major cities drawing protesters of unprecedented diversity in race gender and age. According to historians and other scholars the problem is embedded in the story of the nation and its culture. Rooted in slavery racial disparities in policing and police violence they say are sustained by systemic exclusion and discrimination and fueled by implicit and explicit bias. Any solution clearly will require myriad new approaches to law enforcement courts and community involvement and comprehensive social change driven from the bottom up and the top down. While police reform has become a major focus the current moment of national reckoning has widened the lens on systemic racism for many Americans. The range of issues though less familiar to some is well known to scholars and activists. Across Harvard for instance faculty members have long explored the ways inequality permeates every aspect of American life. Their research and scholarship sits at the heart of a new Gazette series starting today aimed at finding ways forward in the areas of democracy wealth and opportunity environment and health and education. It begins with this first on policing. Harvard Kennedy School Professor Khalil Gibran Muhammad traces the history of policing in America to slave patrols in the antebellum South in which white citizens were expected to help supervise the movements of enslaved Black people. Like many scholars Khalil Gibran Muhammad professor of history race and public policy at the Harvard Kennedy School traces the history of policing in America to slave patrols in the antebellum South in which white citizens were expected to help supervise the movements of enslaved Black people. This legacy he believes can still be seen in policing today. The surveillance the deputization essentially of all white men to be police officers or in this case slave patrollers and then to dispense corporal punishment on the scene are all baked in from the very beginning he told NPR last year. Slave patrols and the slave codes they enforced ended after the Civil War and the passage of the 13th amendment which formally ended slavery except as a punishment for crime. But Muhammad notes that former Confederate states quickly used that exception to justify new restrictions. Known as the Black codes the various rules limited the kinds of jobs African Americans could hold their rights to buy and own property and even their movements.  The genius of the former Confederate states was to say Oh well if all we need to do is make them criminals and they can be put back in slavery well then that s what we ll do. And that s exactly what the Black codes set out to do. The Black codes for all intents and purposes criminalized every form of African American freedom and mobility political power economic power except the one thing it didn t criminalize was the right to work for a white man on a white man s terms. In particular he said the Ku Klux Klan took about the business of terrorizing policing surveilling and controlling Black people. The Klan totally dominates the machinery of justice in the South.  When during what became known as the Great Migration millions of African Americans fled the still largely agrarian South for opportunities in the thriving manufacturing centers of the North they discovered that metropolitan police departments tended to enforce the law along racial and ethnic lines with newcomers overseen by those who came before. There was an early emphasis on people whose status was just a tiny notch better than the folks whom they were focused on policing Muhammad said. And so the AngloSaxons are policing the Irish or the Germans are policing the Irish. The Irish are policing the Poles. And then arrived a wave of Black Southerners looking for a better life. In his groundbreaking work The Condemnation of Blackness Race Crime and the Making of Modern Urban America Muhammad argues that an essential turning point came in the early 1900s amid efforts to professionalize police forces across the nation in part by using crime statistics to guide law enforcement efforts. For the first time Americans with European roots were grouped into one broad category white and set apart from the other category Black. Citing Muhammad s research Harvard historian Jill Lepore has summarized the consequences this way Police patrolled Black neighborhoods and arrested Black people disproportionately prosecutors indicted Black people disproportionately juries found Black people guilty disproportionately judges gave Black people disproportionately long sentences and then after all this social scientists observing the number of Black people in jail decided that as a matter of biology Black people were disproportionately inclined to criminality.   History shows that crime data was never objective in any meaningful sense Muhammad wrote. Instead crime statistics were weaponized to justify racial profiling police brutality and ever more policing of Black people. This phenomenon he believes has continued well into this century and is exemplified by William J. Bratton one of the most famous police leaders in recent America history. Known as America s Top Cop Bratton led police departments in his native Boston Los Angeles and twice in New York finally retiring in 2016. Bratton rejected notions that crime was a result of social and economic forces such as poverty unemployment police practices and racism. Instead he said in a 2017 speech It is about behavior. Through most of his career he was a proponent of statisticallybased predictive policing essentially placing forces in areas where crime numbers were highest focused on the groups found there. Bratton argued that the technology eliminated the problem of prejudice in policing without ever questioning potential bias in the data or algorithms themselves a significant issue given the fact that Black Americans are arrested and convicted of crimes at disproportionately higher rates than whites. This approach has led to widely discredited practices such as racial profiling and stopandfrisk. And Muhammad notes There is no research consensus on whether or how much violence dropped in cities due to policing.  In 2015 The Washington Post began tracking every fatal shooting by an onduty officer using news stories social media posts and police reports in the wake of the fatal police shooting of Brown a Black teenager in Ferguson Mo. According to the newspaper Black Americans are killed by police at twice the rate of white Americans and Hispanic Americans are also killed by police at a disproportionate rate. Such efforts have proved useful for researchers such as economist Rajiv Sethi. A Joy Foundation Fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute Sethi is investigating the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers a difficult task given that data from such encounters is largely unavailable from police departments. Instead Sethi and his team of researchers have turned to information collected by websites and news organizations including The Washington Post and The Guardian merged with data from other sources such as the Bureau of Justice Statistics the Census and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Joy Foundation Fellow at the Harvard Radcliffe Institute Rajiv Sethi is investigating the use of lethal force by law enforcement officers They have found that exposure to deadly force is highest in the Mountain West and Pacific regions relative to the midAtlantic and northeastern states and that racial disparities in relation to deadly force are even greater than the national numbers imply. In the country as a whole you re about two to three times more likely to face deadly force if you re Black than if you are white said Sethi. But if you look at individual cities separately disparities in exposure are much higher.  Examining the characteristics associated with police departments that experience high numbers of lethal encounters is one way to better understand and address racial disparities in policing and the use of violence Sethi said but it s a massive undertaking given the decentralized nature of policing in America. There are roughly 18000 police departments in the country and more than 3000 sheriff s offices each with its own approaches to training and selection.  They behave in very different ways and what we re finding in our current research is that they are very different in the degree to which they use deadly force said Sethi. To make real change You really need to focus on the agency level where organizational culture lies where selection and training protocols have an effect and where leadership can make a difference.  Sethi pointed to the example of Camden N.J. which disbanded and replaced its police force in 2013 initially in response to a budget crisis but eventually resulting in an effort to fundamentally change the way the police engaged with the community. While there have been improvements including greater witness cooperation lower crime and fewer abuse complaints the Camden case doesn t fit any particular narrative said Sethi noting that the number of officers actually increased as part of the reform. While the city is still faced with its share of problems Sethi called its efforts to rethink policing important models from which we can learn.  For many analysts the real problem with policing in America is the fact that there is simply too much of it. We ve seen since the mid1970s a dramatic increase in expenditures that are associated with expanding the criminal legal system including personnel and the tasks we ask police to do said Sandra Susan Smith Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Professor of Criminal Justice at HKS and the Carol K. Pforzheimer Professor at the Radcliffe Institute. And at the same time we see dramatic declines in resources devoted to social welfare programs.   You can have all the armored personnel carriers you want in Ferguson but public safety is more likely to come from redressing environmental pollution poor education and unfair work said Brandon Terry assistant professor of African and African American Studies and social studies. Smith s comment highlights a key argument embraced by many activists and experts calling for dramatic police reform diverting resources from the police to better support community services including health care housing and education and stronger economic and job opportunities. They argue that broader support for such measures will decrease the need for policing and in turn reduce violent confrontations particularly in overpoliced economically disadvantaged communities and communities of color. For Brandon Terry that tension took the form of an ice container during his Baltimore high school chemistry final. The frozen cubes were placed in the middle of the classroom to help keep the students cool as a heat wave sent temperatures soaring. That was their solution to the building s lack of air conditioning said Terry a Harvard assistant professor of African and African American Studies and social studies. Just grab an ice cube.  Terry s story is the kind many researchers cite to show the negative impact of underinvesting in children who will make up the future population and instead devoting resources toward policing tactics that embrace armored vehicles automatic weapons and spy planes. Terry s is also the kind of tale promoted by activists eager to defund the police a movement begun in the late 1960s that has again gained momentum as the death toll from violent encounters mounts. A scholar of Martin Luther King Jr. Terry said the Civil Rights leader s views on the Vietnam War are echoed in the calls of activists today who are pressing to redistribute police resources.  King thought that the idea of spending many orders of magnitude more for an unjust war than we did for the abolition of poverty and the abolition of ghettoization was a moral travesty and it reflected a kind of sickness at the core of our society said Terry. And part of what the defund model is based upon is a similar moral criticism that these budgets reflect priorities that we have and our priorities are broken.  Terry also thinks the policing debate needs to be expanded to embrace a fuller understanding of what it means for people to feel truly safe in their communities. He highlights the work of sociologist Chris Muller and Harvard s Robert Sampson who have studied racial disparities in exposures to lead and the connections between a child s early exposure to the toxic metal and antisocial behavior. Various studies have shown that lead exposure in children can contribute to cognitive impairment and behavioral problems including heightened aggression.  You can have all the armored personnel carriers you want in Ferguson said Terry but public safety is more likely to come from redressing environmental pollution poor education and unfair work.  Alexandra Natapoff Lee S. Kreindler Professor of Law sees policing as inexorably linked to the country s criminal justice system and its long ties to racism.  Policing does not stand alone or apart from how we charge people with crimes or how we convict them or how we treat them once they ve been convicted she said. That entire bundle of official practices is a central part of how we govern and in particular how we have historically governed Black people and other people of color and economically and socially disadvantaged populations.  Unpacking such a complicated issue requires voices from a variety of different backgrounds experiences and fields of expertise who can shine light on the problem and possible solutions said Natapoff who cofounded a new lecture series with HLS Professor Andrew Crespo titled Policing in America.  In recent weeks the pair have hosted Zoom discussions on topics ranging from qualified immunity to the Black Lives Matter movement to police unions to the broad contours of the American penal system. The series reflects the important work being done around the country said Natapoff and offers people the chance to further engage in dialogue over these over these rich complicated controversial issues around race and policing and governance and democracy.  Much of Natapoff s recent work emphasizes the hidden dangers of the nation s misdemeanor system. In her book Punishment Without Crime How Our Massive Misdemeanor System Traps the Innocent and Makes America More Unequal Natapoff shows how the practice of stopping arresting and charging people with lowlevel offenses often sends them down a devastating path.  This is how most people encounter the criminal apparatus and it s the first step of mass incarceration the initial net that sweeps people of color disproportionately into the criminal system said Natapoff. It is also the locus that overexposes Black people to police violence. The implications of this enormous net of police and prosecutorial authority around minor conduct is central to understanding many of the worst dysfunctions of our criminal system.  One consequence is that Black and brown people are incarcerated at much higher rates than white people. America has approximately 2.3 million people in federal state and local prisons and jails according to a 2020 report from the nonprofit the Prison Policy Initiative. According to a 2018 report from the Sentencing Project Black men are 5.9 times as likely to be incarcerated as white men and Hispanic men are 3.1 times as likely. Reducing mass incarceration requires shrinking the misdemeanor net along all of its axes said Natapoff who supports a range of reforms including training police officers to both confront and arrest people less for lowlevel offenses and the policies of forwardthinking prosecutors willing to charge fewer of those offenses when police do make arrests.  She praises the efforts of Suffolk County District Attorney Rachael Rollins in Massachusetts and George Gasc n the district attorney in Los Angeles County Calif. who have pledged to stop prosecuting a range of misdemeanor crimes such as resisting arrest loitering trespassing and drug possession. If cities and towns across the country committed to that kind of reform that would be a profoundly meaningful change said Natapoff and it would be a big step toward shrinking our entire criminal apparatus.  Retired U.S. Judge Nancy Gertner cites the need to reform federal sentencing guidelines arguing that all too often they have been proven to be biased and to result in packing the nation s jails and prisons. Another contributing factor in mass incarceration is sentencing disparities. A recent Harvard Law School study found that as is true nationally people of color are drastically overrepresented in Massachusetts state prisons. But the report also noted that Black and Latinx people were less likely to have their cases resolved through pretrial probation a way to dismiss charges if the accused meet certain conditions and receive much longer sentences than their white counterparts. Retired U.S. Judge Nancy Gertner also notes the need to reform federal sentencing guidelines arguing that all too often they have been proven to be biased and to result in packing the nation s jails and prisons. She points to the way the 1994 Crime Bill legislation sponsored by thenSen. Joe Biden of Delaware ushered in much harsher drug penalties for crack than for powder cocaine. This tied the hands of judges issuing sentences and disproportionately punished people of color in the process. The disparity in the treatment of crack and cocaine really was backed up by anecdote and stereotype not by data said Gertner a lecturer at HLS. There was no data suggesting that crack was infinitely more dangerous than cocaine. It was the young Black predator narrative.  The First Step Act a bipartisan prison reform bill aimed at reducing racial disparities in drug sentencing and signed into law by President Donald Trump in 2018 is just what its name implies said Gertner.  It reduces sentences to the merely inhumane rather than the grotesque. We still throw people in jail more than anybody else. We still resort to imprisonment rather than thinking of other alternatives. We still resort to punishment rather than other models. None of that has really changed. I don t deny the significance of somebody getting out of prison a year or two early but no one should think that that s reform.  Reform has long been a goal for federal leaders. Many heralded Obamaera changes aimed at eliminating racial disparities in policing and outlined in the report by The President s Task Force on 21st Century policing. But HKS s Smith saw them as largely symbolic. It s a nod to reform. But most of the reforms that are implemented in this country tend to be reforms that nibble around the edges and don t really make much of a difference.  Efforts such as diversifying police forces and implicit bias training do little to change behaviors and reduce violent conduct against people of color said Smith who cites studies suggesting a majority of Americans hold negative biases against Black and brown people and that unconscious prejudices and stereotypes are difficult to erase.  Experiments show that you can in the context of a day get people to think about race differently and maybe even behave differently. But if you follow up say a week or two weeks later those effects are gone. We don t know how to produce effects that are longlasting. We invest huge amounts to implement such police reforms but most often there s no empirical evidence to support their efficacy.  Even the early studies around the effectiveness of body cameras suggest the devices do little to change officers patterns of behavior said Smith though she cautions that researchers are still in the early stages of collecting and analyzing the data. And though police body cameras have caught officers in unjust violence much of the general public views the problem as anomalous.  Despite what many people in lowincome communities of color think about police officers the broader society has a lot of respect for police and thinks if you just get rid of the bad apples everything will be fine Smith added. The problem of course is this is not just an issue of bad apples.  Efforts such as diversifying police forces and implicit bias training do little to change behaviors and reduce violent conduct against people of color said Sandra Susan Smith a professor of criminal justice Harvard Kennedy School. Still Smith sees reason for hope and possible ways forward involving a range of communitybased approaches. As part of the effort to explore meaningful change Smith along with Christopher Winship DikerTishman Professor of Sociology at Harvard University and a member of the senior faculty at HKS have organized Reimagining Community Safety A Program in Criminal Justice Speaker Series to better understand the perspectives of practitioners policymakers community leaders activists and academics engaged in public safety reform. Some communitybased safety models have yielded important results. Smith singles out the Crisis Assistance Helping Out on the Streets program known as CAHOOTS in Eugene Ore. which supplements police with a communitybased public safety program. When callers dial 911 they are often diverted to teams of workers trained in crisis resolution mental health and emergency medicine who are better equipped to handle nonlifethreatening situations. The numbers support her case. In 2017 the program received 25000 calls only 250 of which required police assistance. Training similar teams of specialists who don t carry weapons to handle all traffic stops could go a long way toward ending violent police encounters she said.  Imagine you have those kinds of services in play said Smith paired with communitybased antiviolence program such as Cure Violence which aims to stop violence in targeted neighborhoods by using approaches health experts take to control disease such as identifying and treating individuals and changing social norms. Together she said these programs could make a huge difference.  At Harvard Law School students have been studying how an alternate 911response team might function in Boston. We were trying to move from thinking about a 911response system as an opportunity to intervene in an acute moment to thinking about what it would look like to have a system that is trying to help reweave some of the threads of community a system that is more focused on healing than just on stopping harm said HLS Professor Rachel Viscomi who directs the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program and oversaw the research. The forthcoming report compiled by two students in the HLS clinic Billy Roberts and Anna Vande Velde will offer officials a range of ideas for how to think about community safety that builds on existing efforts in Boston and other cities said Viscomi. But Smith like others knows communitybased interventions are only part of the solution. She applauds the Justice Department s investigation into the Ferguson Police Department after the shooting of Brown. The 102page report shed light on the department s discriminatory policing practices including the ways police disproportionately targeted Black residents for tickets and fines to help balance the city s budget. To fix such entrenched problems state governments need to rethink their spending priorities and tax systems so they can provide cities and towns the financial support they need to remain debtfree said Smith. Rethinking the 911response system to being one that is more focused on healing than just on stopping harm is part of the studentled research under the direction of Law School Professor Rachel Viscomi who heads up the Harvard Negotiation and Mediation Clinical Program.  Part of the solution has to be a discussion about how government is funded and how a city like Ferguson got to a place where government had so few resources that they resorted to extortion of their residents in particular residents of color in order to make ends meet she said. We ve learned since that Ferguson is hardly the only municipality that has struggled with funding issues and sought to address them through the oppression and repression of their politically socially and economically marginalized Black and Latino residents.  Police contracts she said also need to be reexamined. The daughter of a union man Smith said she firmly supports officers rights to union representation to secure fair wages health care and safe working conditions. But the power unions hold to structure police contracts in ways that protect officers from being disciplined for illegal and unethical behavior needs to be challenged she said.  I think it s incredibly important for individuals to be held accountable and for those institutions in which they are embedded to hold them to account. But we routinely find that union contracts buffer individual officers from having to be accountable. We see this at the level of the Supreme Court as well whose rulings around qualified immunity have protected law enforcement from civil suits. That needs to change.  Other Harvard experts agree. In an opinion piece in The Boston Globe last June Tomiko BrownNagin dean of the Harvard Radcliffe Institute and the Daniel P.S. Paul Professor of Constitutional Law at HLS pointed out the Court s expansive interpretation of qualified immunity and called for reform that would promote accountability.   This nation is devoted to freedom to combating racial discrimination and to making government accountable to the people wrote BrownNagin. Legislators today like those who passed landmark Civil Rights legislation more than 50 years ago must take a stand for equal justice under law.
