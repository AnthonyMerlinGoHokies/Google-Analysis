https://inclusiveamerica.org/why-diversity-is-important/, A government representative of its people is better run more meritocratic and helps achieve equity. It creates and implements more inclusive policies and elevates a diverse set of role models. Leaders from diverse backgrounds often develop more creative insights proffer alternative and comprehensive solutions and thus make decisions that better serve the American people.  We believe Diversity Equity and Inclusion DEI in Government is important because it leads to  By 2040 the United States of America will be a minoritymajority country. Yet in 2018 93 of the people running the federal government were White and 80 of them were men. The current makeup of our government does not reflect the nation s current or growing diversity and also fails to fulfill our founding fathers constitutional promise of a nation that is of the people by the people and for the people.  We are dedicated to leveling the playing field and advocating for a more representative democracy. Numerous studies have shown that inclusive workplaces significantly outperform wellmanaged homogeneous workplaces over time. Individuals are more committed innovative loyal but most importantly are more comfortable sharing their ideas and perspectives. Diversity is a strength and when these differences are embraced can encourage better results.  We are therefore committed to centering diversity equity and inclusion in government as a means of establishing a more productive work environment.  Diversity equity and inclusion in government leads to an overall increase of political efficacy. Political efficacy is the belief that one s civic participation leads to meaningful social change further stabilizing our democratic processes. In fact higher levels of efficacy correlates to an increase of voter turnout. According to the PEW Research Center s 2016 Voter Analysis nearly 35 of registered American nonvoters disliked candidates or campaign issues or felt that their vote wouldn t make a difference.  We are passionate about addressing this discrepancy and eliminating voter apathy. Employment policies that embrace diversity equity and inclusion are instrumental in attaining the goal of a just and effective Federal Government and reflect the Federal Government s responsibility as the Nation s largest employer to lead by example.  Furthermore diversifying the pool of leaders will allow unique experiences opinions and perspectives on critical issues and will thus help enhance our government s ability to serve the needs of its entire population especially historically disenfranchised communities.  The public will support and abide by these policies when they see people like them making the decisions. They will feel represented and trust that the Federal Government is considering and implementing the necessary steps to fulfill the people s best interest. No one knows the needs of a community better than the people in it. The inclusion of underrepresented perspectives brings emphasis on addressing issues impacting vulnerable communities which often benefits all of society socially and economically. We believe in the Nation s desire and need to have a just and representative Federal Government and are dedicated to pushing for a Federal Government that looks like America. Emphasis on diversity equity and inclusion within the government is integral in benefitting the welfare of their people. The Federal Government must by law and in pursuit of our national ideals endeavor to achieve a work force from all segments of society 5 U.S.C. 2301b1. To safeguard the Nation s foundational value of representative democracy the Federal Government must commit itself to diversity equity and inclusion at all levels of employment. By necessity this commitment must be woven into the fabric of Federal recruitment hiring retention and promotion.  We are dedicated to ensuring that the Nation s government runs as it is meant to representing our society.  Here are examples of departments and agencies mentioning their approach on embracing diversity and its benefits toward the people in their equity snapshots  Advancing equity requires a qualified and diverse workforce that is representative of the communities that it serves   NASA s Science Mission Directorate has been working to develop longterm relationships with new diverse partners better reflect the diversity of the nation and enable greater participation by underrepresented groups in agency efforts.   The Peace Corps mission of world peace and friendship and its approach to achieving this mission requires a diverse Corps to model how individuals from diverse backgrounds can unite to address important and challenging goals.   Advancing equity rests on the presumption of equal opportunities and protection under the law. As noted in the Executive Order government programs are designed to serve all eligible individuals   The Executive Order reaffirms that the United States U.S. is at its strongest when our Nation s workforce reflects the communities it serves and when our public servants are fully equipped to advance equitable outcomes for all American communities.   As the Nation s largest employer the federal workforce must be our country s model of excellence for diversity equity inclusion and accessibility DEIA. Meeting this mandate requires all of us public servants at all levels of every agency to contribute to advancing DEIA in the federal workforce.   Strengthening the federal workforce by promoting DEIA is a crossfunctional priority that must leverage the efforts capabilities and resources of the whole agency. DEIA should be reflected in the norms and values of each agency. DEIA is not an addon or separate program but rather a priority that must be integrated into and across agency functions and embedded into agency culture. This framework ensures DEIA is further incorporated into organizational planning documents including an agency s budget learning agenda and annual evaluation plan regulatory agenda performance planning human capital operating plan and overall strategic plan.

Across the country LGBTQ Americans face a variety of issues that are different from nonLGBTQ Americans. The Center for American Progress studied the effects of discrimination on 1528 LGBTQ adults. Their findings included the following  More than 1 in 3 LGBTQ Americans faced discrimination of some kind in the past year including more than 3 in 5 transgender Americans   To avoid the experience of discrimination more than half of LGBTQ Americans report hiding a personal relationship and about onefifth to onethird have altered other aspects of their personal or work lives   Discrimination adversely affects the mental and economic wellbeing of many LGBTQ Americans including 1 in 2 who report moderate or significant negative psychological impacts   Around 3 in 10 LGBTQ Americans faced difficulties last year accessing necessary medical care due to cost issues including more than half of transgender Americans  These are all significant and problematic issues. Thankfully increased representation for LGBTQ Americans in Congress could lead to bills that protect LGBTQ Americans from discrimination or bills that expand access to healthcare. In fact a 2013 study indicates that just having a few LGBTQ members of Congress can lead to a better quality of life for all LGBTQ Americans. The study published in The American Political Science Review argues  The presence of even a small number of openly gay legislators is associated significantly with the future passage of enhanced gay rights even after including controls for social values democracy government ideology and electoral system design. Once openly gay legislators are in office they have a transformative effect on the views and voting behavior of their straight colleagues.  While this study focused on representation for gay Americans the there d likely be similar effects if other groups of LGBTQ people were represented in Congress. As a result this study emphasizes the need for equal representation for all LGBTQ Americans as having just a few more LGBTQ Americans in Congress could shift Congress priorities. Due to a longstanding history of racism and a general exclusion from U.S policy Latino Americans face a variety of issues stemming from a lack of access to resources and opportunity.  General confidence among Latino Americans about their place in America also falls short. In 2018 47 percent of Latino Americans claimed that the state of the U.S for Latino Americans was worse than a year earlier up from 15 percent in 2013. This decrease in optimism is represented in a few key areas where Latino Americans needs are consistently not met and interest in reform is highest including education the economy and health care Education The high school graduation rate among Latinos was 78 percent in 2013 compared with 86 percent among white students. Additionally 21 percent of Latino eighth graders were proficient in reading compared to 44 percent of white eighth graders. Adverse socioeconomic conditions and a lack of educational resources contribute to this disparity in education. The Economy The average Latino household has a net worth of 20000 compared to 100000 for nonLatino families. Access to saving services prohibits longterm saving with only 15 of Latino families having three months of living expenses stored in accessible accounts compared to 42 percent of nonLatino families. Furthermore only 28 of Latino families had high financial literacy compared to 43 of white families. Without access to financial resources and education Latino families will continue to fall behind in important metrics of financial stability and success. Health Care More than 7 million Latino Americans 39 go without healthcare coverage limiting available medical care by about 50. Additionally significant language barriers between Latino American patients and medical professionals as well as a deficiency of Latino American healthcare professionals limits the capacity of effective medical care.  Without representation in national and state governments Latino Americans face these issues without any advocacy in government limiting solutions greatly.  Economic inequality has long been present in America and existing institutions such as government welfare programs and affordable healthcare have been created to provide a helping hand to countless families and increase social mobility. Despite this progress lower and middle income families still struggle financially. 61 percent of Americans claim that there is too much economic inequality and for good reason from 1983 to 2016 the median wealth of upper class families increased from 344100 to 848000 with their share of U.S aggregate wealth increasing from 60 to 79 while the median wealth of lower class families decreasing from 12300 to 11300 with their share of U.S aggregate wealth decreasing from 7 to 4. This great disparity in wealth and economic opportunity can be represented by a few key areas where governmental assistance falls short Generational Poverty 20 percent of children and 25 percent of parents live in households with incomes below the poverty line. However poverty also depends largely on race 31 of black and native american children 27 of hispanic children and 25 of pacific islander children lived in poverty compared to only 11 of asian and white children. This lack of financial stability limits economic mobility for both parents and children. Education 73 of children who have parents with no high school diplomas live in poverty and 46 of children that have parents with a high school diploma but no college education live in poverty. On the other hand only 17 of children that have parents with college degrees live in poverty. With higher costs for higher education and greater disparities in K12 education equality opportunities for future economic success are limited without proper educational access. Job Availability Among low income parents parents had very limited employment opportunities and often took any available jobs they could find jobs provided unstable income work schedules were inflexible and job inflexibility and a lack of childcare made it difficult to support children. Without jobs that can provide these bare necessities low income parents seeking work that can afford economic mobility will not be presented with many opportunities. Without members of Congress that can represent the diverse needs of low and middle income families and with hefty financial barriers to running for office low income Americans will continue to lack basic economic stability. The lack of diversity in Congress does not only counter democratic values it tangibly harms many Americans lives. Without political representation many structural inequities along with the needs of specific communities are not addressed. Legislators and everyday Americans must work to create a system in which a more diverse Congress is elected.

Many of the issues that they face are not being adequately addressed and pushed to the side. One reason for this is the lack of representation they hold in our Congress where the decisions are being made. As a result Black Americans continue to struggle with the issues that they face. Some of these issues include Discrimination from law enforcement Black Americans are five times more likely to be stopped without just cause than a white American. Black and Hispanic people make up about 13 of the population but 22 of fatal police shootings. Whereas white Americans makeup about 60 of the population but only 41 of fatal police shootings. 84 of Black adults say white people are treated better than black people by police 63 of white adults agree based on 2019 research on police relations. Criminal Justice System Black Americans are incarcerated at more than 5 times the rate of white Americans. 87 of Black adults say the U.S. criminal justice system is more unjust towards Black people 61 of white adults agree. America remains one of the few countries that do not have explicit guarantees of gender equality written into their countries Constitution. The 19th Amendment was passed by Congress but it was ratified in 1920 and finally gave women the right to vote and have more of a role in politics. This amendment was implemented 131 years from the time the Constitution and Congress was implemented. However despite gaining the right to vote women are still facing the gender roles placed on them by society and are being told that women do not belong in politics. Societal gender roles impact women s role in politics because politics has continuously been viewed as a masculine topic that women should have no part in. Gender roles also make it more difficult for women candidates to get votes because they have more to prove to obtain the same vote share as male candidates and are looked down as discarding the roles society believes that women need to fulfill in society. From America s founding women have faced gender inequalities in multiple areas of society and have had to combat many of these inequalities between genders. In 2021 and years before women s rights have been an issue in society and throughout our government. They have been in the hands of a majoritymale Congress representing the 51 of women in our country. Women also face inequalities in wages. We have seen a gender wage gap throughout our country leading to different wages between genders. A woman will make 98 cents for every dollar a man will make doing the same job and having the same qualifications. Looking at the median salary of men and women regardless of any factors shows that women make 82 cents for every dollar a man makes on average. This is Part One of a threepart series. Check back for parts two and three of this analysis on the consequences of underrepresentation in the United States Congress.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/01/28/racial-ethnic-diversity-increases-yet-again-with-the-117th-congress/, About a quarter of voting members 23 of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate are racial or ethnic minorities making the 117th Congress the most racially and ethnically diverse in history. There has been a longrunning trend toward higher numbers of nonWhite lawmakers on Capitol Hill This is the sixth Congress to break the record set by the one before it. Overall 124 lawmakers today identify as Black Hispanic AsianPacific Islander or Native American according to a Pew Research Center analysis of data from the Congressional Research Service. This represents a 97 increase over the 107th Congress of 200103 which had 63 minority members. Among today s senators and representatives the overwhelming majority of racial and ethnic minority members are Democrats 83 while 17 are Republicans. This represents a shift from the last Congress when just 10 of nonWhite lawmakers were Republicans. Our analysis reflects the 532 voting members of Congress seated as of Jan. 26 2021. This analysis builds on earlier Pew Research Center work to analyze the racial and ethnic makeup of the U.S. Congress. To determine the number of racial and ethnic minority lawmakers in the 117th Congress we used data from the Congressional Research Service. U.S. population data comes from the U.S. Census Bureau. Historical data was pulled from CQ Roll Call CRS and the Brookings Institution. All racial groups refer to singlerace nonHispanics. Hispanics are of any race. Native Hawaiian Rep. Kai Kahele DHawaii is counted with the Native American lawmakers. Our analysis reflects the 532 voting members of Congress seated as of Jan. 26 2021. In the House one New York race has not been called yet and one Louisiana seat is empty because the congressmanelect died before he could be sworn in. We did not include former Louisiana Rep. Cedric Richmond who resigned in January to join the Biden administration. The current number of voting House members is 432. Biden administration nominees who were not yet confirmed at the time of writing are included in our count. Independent members of Congress are counted with the party they caucus with. Although recent Congresses have continued to set new highs for racial and ethnic diversity they have still been disproportionately White when compared with the overall U.S. population. NonHispanic White Americans account for 77 of voting members in the new Congress considerably larger than their 60 share of the U.S. population overall. This gap hasn t narrowed with time In 1981 94 of members of Congress were White compared with 80 of the U.S. population. In the House of Representatives however representation of some racial and ethnic groups is now on par with their share of the total population. For example 13 of House members are Black about equal to the share of Black Americans. And Native Americans now make up about 1 of both the House and the U.S. population. Other racial and ethnic groups in the House are somewhat less represented relative to their share of the population. The share of Hispanics in the U.S. population 19 is about twice as high as it is in the House 9. Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders together account for 6 of the national population and 3 of House members. This analysis includes four representatives who are counted under more than one racial or ethnic identity Rep. Robert Scott DVa. is counted as Black and Asian. Reps. Antonio Delgado and Ritchie Torres both New York Democrats are listed as Black and Hispanic. Rep. Marilyn Strickland DWash. is both the first Black lawmaker to represent the state and one of the first Korean American women to be elected to Congress. Native Hawaiian Rep. Kai Kahele DHawaii is counted with the Native American lawmakers. Portuguese American members are not included in the Hispanic count. In the House Republicans account for a larger share of newly elected minority representatives than in the past. Of the 16 freshmen representatives who are nonWhite nine are Republicans compared with just one of the 22 new representatives in the 116th Congress. This freshman cohort includes the only two Black Republicans in the chamber Burgess Owens of Utah and Byron Donalds of Florida. Eleven senators are a racial or ethnic minority up from nine in the 116th Congress. Six senators are Hispanic two are Asian and three are Black. Freshman Raphael Warnock is the first Black senator to represent Georgia and another freshman Alex Padilla is the first Hispanic senator to represent California. Padilla replaced Vice President and former Sen. Kamala Harris who was one of four women of color and the only Black woman serving in the Senate. Just three of the 11 nonWhite senators are Republicans Tim Scott of South Carolina is Black and Marco Rubio of Florida and Ted Cruz of Texas are both Hispanic.

https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/minority-rule-cannot-last-america/617272/, Though this period of minority rule is new since World War II it is far from unprecedented. Unequal legislative apportionment has been a recurring quality of American government since its establishment. Parties who have found themselves in power by institutional oddities rather than overall weight of vote have refused to reach across the aisle instead using their institutional advantage to further consolidate their hold on power. Although such tactics have been successful in the short term they have ultimately been only temporary expedients. When the minority parties were finally removed from power the backlash against them was swift and strong. Read How the minority wins Begin at the nation s founding. At the time when American colonists started actively considering independence from Britain Pennsylvania s legislature no longer proportionally represented its population. The Pennsylvania Assembly had proved efficient and professional throughout the 18th century defending the interests of the colonial population against British imperial officials but as the colony s population expanded westward eastern elites refused to extend representation to the predominantly ScotchIrish and German immigrants living in the new settlements. Additionally while Philadelphia had grown to become the most populous city in North America political leaders from the surrounding counties refused to increase the city s number of representatives. By the early 1770s the state s most radical voices in favor of revolution Philadelphians and westerners were systematically underrepresented in the legislature. In the short term the denial of proportional representation worked Pennsylvania s government designed to amplify moderate and conservative voices was notoriously slow to endorse resistance to Britain and in 1776 refused to allow its delegates in the Continental Congress to vote for independence. By this point though Pennsylvania s radicals had taken matters into their own hands. Drawing on protest movements that had gathered pace in 1774 and 1775 they organized a series of conventions giving greater voice to the marginalized. When in May 1776 the Continental Congress called on states to form their own governments Pennsylvanians bypassed the colonial assembly entirely and used the convention and committee movements to send proindependence delegates to Congress and to write their own state constitution. In September 1776 Pennsylvania s radicals took their revenge. Each county was given more or less equal representation in the first legislature. This measure was about as biased toward the western counties as the previous arrangements had been toward eastern ones. But having been shut out of power for so long the radicals were keen to ensure they held the reins. Pennsylvania s first constitution by a long shot the most radically democratic of all the original 13 states was bitterly contested for the next decade. Conservative opponents tried and failed to revise the state constitution four times from 1776 until 1783. Though they finally succeeded in writing a new constitution in 1790 it came at the cost of 14 years of unstable and rancorous government. Just decades later in the antebellum period similar dynamics played out once again. Slaveholding states sought to use constitutional arrangements to maintain minority power. The Missouri Compromise of 1820 which admitted slaveholding Missouri to the union at the same time as free Maine maintained balance in the Senate between free and slave states. Southern politicians considered this balance vital as it gave a de facto veto to slaveholding states. But demographic change over the ensuing decades quickly meant that northerners outnumbered southerners. Yet only in the aftermath of the notorious Compromise of 1850 and the admission of California as a free state did the balance between free and slave states snap at a time when the population of free states was 13.4 million well exceeding the 9.7 million inhabitants of slave states of whom 3.2 million were enslaved and couldn t vote. In the decade that followed the South attempted to recreate its minority veto with disastrous results. The politics of the 1850s became consumed with the question of slavery. Southern slaveowners insisted on a new Fugitive Slave Act in 1850 which compelled northern authorities and other residents to actively participate in arresting and returning fugitive slaves to their enslavers. Northerners responded furiously adopting antislavery politics in greater numbers. Southerners fearful of the growing strength of the abolitionist movement and the specter of a permanent electoral minority demanded more slaveholding territory as the nation expanded westward many called for slavery to be legal in all federal territories and advocated foreign war to annex new slaveholding territory such as Cuba. In 1854 Senator Stephen Douglas of Illinois attempted to broker a compromise between North and South with his KansasNebraska Act. Allowing residents of the Kansas and Nebraska territories to vote on whether to allow slavery within their borders the act was seen in the North as a naked attempt to extend slavery beyond the Missouri Compromise line and give greater weight to slaveholders in the Senate. Voters in the North turned out in force leading to the creation of the Republican Party and ultimately the election of Abraham Lincoln as president. The South s attempts to continually impose minority rule on the North failed leading to secession the Civil War and the greatest number of military casualties for a single war in American history. Clint Smith In 1864 like in 2020 America just got lucky Population shifts contributed to a third episode of minority rule in the early 20th century. Rapid industrialization in the years after the Civil War saw the growth of megacities that fundamentally transformed the demographics of several states. In Illinois Chicago s population grew from 112000 in 1860 6 percent of total state residents to 2.7 million in 1920 or 40 percent of total state residents. According to the state s constitution the state legislature should have reapportioned following each decennial census from 1900 onwards downstate leaders refused to do so leaving Chicago heavily underrepresented and overtaxed. In the 1920s the repeated refusal of the downstate minority to reapportion the legislature was met with increasing frustration from Chicago representatives. Throughout the decade the city council passed angry resolutions condemning the malapportionment. In 1925 with more and more time at council meetings devoted to the topic the council passed a resolution calling for the city to secede from Illinois and to form the State of Chicago. Downstate defenders of the status quo continued to dig their heels in even forming organizations such as the League for the Defense of Downstate Voters. Only in 1955 did the Illinois legislature finally bow to the inevitable redistricting for the first time since 1901. Even then downstate leaders struck a deal to maintain control in the state Senate until Supreme Court rulings in Baker v. Carr 1962 and Reynolds v. Sims 1964 decreed that state legislativedistrict populations be of roughly equal size. Ever since Chicago and Cook County politicians have dominated Illinois elections. What then of the prospects of minority rule at the federal level in the coming years? The coming years seem likely to see Republicans attempt to strengthen their grip on power despite their weakness at the ballot box. With the appointment of Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court conservatives have a 6 3 majority on the bench and important rulings loom on issues such as health care abortion rights and gay marriage. Policies supported by a majority of Americans in opinion polls could be ruled unconstitutional all because a president who lost the popular vote nominated three justices and senators representing a minority of the American population confirmed them. With Presidentelect Biden likely facing a divided Congress Democrats have no institutional means of turning electoral support into legislative action to say nothing of fixing underlying representation issues. But Republicans may not be able to sustain their power for long at least not peacefully. As the cases above show when parties commit themselves to minority rule the backlash can be severe. While the letter of the law allows Republicans to control the Senate and the judiciary the spirit of republican government demands otherwise. The two cannot long exist in tension with each other. Though the 2020 election did not result in a blue tidal wave it did suggest emerging Democratic majorities in formerly red states such as Arizona and Georgia. If eventually demographic change adds North Carolina and Texas to the mix national elections would more accurately reflect the national popular vote. History suggests that Republicans would then pay dearly for their years of minority rule. If Republicans hope for greater success than their historical counterparts they would do well to heed the message that a party cannot maintain power forever and embark on a more genuinely collaborative and bipartisan approach to government. Short of that they risk much more than their political careers. This story is part of the project The Battle for the Constitution in partnership with the National Constitution Center.
