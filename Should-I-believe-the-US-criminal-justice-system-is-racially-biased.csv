https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/opinions/systemic-racism-police-evidence-criminal-justice-system/, In 2016 Sen. Tim Scott RS.C. gave a powerful speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate. Scott talked about how he had been repeatedly pulled over by police officers who seemed to be suspicious of a black man driving a nice car. He added that a black seniorlevel staffer had experienced the same thing and had even downgraded his car in the hope of avoiding the problem. Given that Scott otherwise has pretty conservative politics there was little objection or protest from the right. No one rose up to say that he was lying about getting pulled over. The thing is most people of color have a similar story or know someone who does. Yet there s a deep skepticism on the right of any assertion that the criminal justice system is racially biased. In early August 2018 National Review editor and syndicated columnist Rich Lowry wrote a column disputing the notion that our system is racist. Andrew Sullivan wrote something similar in New York magazine. Interestingly both Lowry and Sullivan cite criminologist John Pfaff to support their positions. Pfaff has since protested on Twitter that both misinterpreted what he wrote. And attempting to refute the notion that the system is racist has become a pretty regular beat for conservative crime pundit Heather Mac Donald. Of particular concern to some on the right is the term systemic racism often wrongly interpreted as an accusation that everyone in the system is racist. In fact systemic racism means almost the opposite. It means that we have systems and institutions that produce racially disparate outcomes regardless of the intentions of the people who work within them. When you consider that much of the criminal justice system was built honed and firmly established during the Jim Crow era an era almost everyone conservatives included will concede rife with racism this is pretty intuitive. The modern criminal justice system helped preserve racial order it kept black people in their place. For much of the early 20th century in some parts of the country that was its primary function. That it might retain some of those proclivities today shouldn t be all that surprising. In any case after more than a decade covering these issues it s pretty clear to me that the evidence of racial bias in our criminal justice system isn t just convincing it s overwhelming. But because there still seems to be some skepticism I ve attempted below to catalog the evidence. The list below isn t remotely comprehensive. And if you know of other studies please send them to me. I would like to make this piece a repository for this issue. I of course can t vouch for the robustness or statistical integrity of all of these studies. I m only summarizing them. But for the most part I ve tried to include either peerreviewed studies or reviews of data that tend to speak for themselves and don t require much statistical analysis. I will note that most but not all of these studies do factor in variables that address common claims such as that the criminal justice system discriminates more by class than by race or that racial discrepancies in sentencing or incarceration can be explained by the fact that black people commit more crimes. And I ve also included a section for studies that do not find bias in various aspects of the criminal justice system. There are far fewer of these though I m open to the possibility that I missed some. Finally none of this is to say that race is the only thing we need to worry about in the criminal justice system. Certainly lots of white people are wrongly accused arrested and convicted. Lots of white people are treated unfairly beaten and unjustifiably shot and killed by police officers. White people too are harmed by policies such as mandatory minimums asset forfeiture and abuse of police prosecutorial and judicial power. There are problems here that are inextricable from race. And there are problems that aren t directly related to race. But even the latter set of problems tend to be exacerbated when you factor race into the equation. On to the evidence. I ve had more than one retired police officer tell me there is a running joke in law enforcement when it comes to racial profiling It never happens . . . and it works. But the problem with trying to dismiss profiling concerns by noting that higher rates at which some minority groups commit certain crimes is that it overlooks the fact that huge percentages of black and Latino people have been pulled over stopped on the street and generally harassed despite the fact that they have done nothing wrong. Stopandfrisk data for example consistently show that about 3 percent of these encounters produce any evidence of a crime. So 97 percentplus of these people are getting punished solely because they belong to a group that statistically commits some crimes at a higher rate. That ought to bother us. Black people are consistently arrested charged and convicted of drug crimes including possession distribution and conspiracy at far higher rates than white people. This despite research showing that both races use and sell drugs at about the same rate. Though the Supreme Court made it illegal for prosecutors to exclude prospective jurors because of race in the 1986 case Batson v. Kentucky that ruling has largely gone unenforced. The New Yorker reported in 2015 that in the approximately 30 years since the ruling courts have accepted the flimsiest excuses for striking black jurors and that prosecutors have in turn trained subordinates how to strike black jurors without a judicial rebuke. A 2010 report by the Equal Justice Initiative documented cases in which courts upheld prosecutors dismissal of jurors because of allegedly raceneutral factors such as affiliation with a historically black college a son in an interracial marriage living in a blackmajority neighborhood or that a juror shucked and jived.  There are no comprehensive national data on the rate at which prosecutors strike black jurors but there have been quite a few regional studies. Prosecutors on aggregate don t seem to seek the death penalty more for black people than white people though there are definitely some gaping disparities in a few states and in some counties. Instead the real racial bias when it comes to the death penalty pertains to the race of the victim. Killers of black people rarely get death sentences. White killers of black people get death sentences even less frequently. And far and away the type of murder most likely to bring a death sentence is a black man who kills a white woman. Depending on which study you look at somewhere between 80 and 95 percent of criminal cases are resolved with a plea bargain before ever getting to trial. While most legal observers agree that plea bargaining is widely abused and does little to serve the interests of justice most also believe believe that if every defendant were to insist on a trial the system would come grinding to a halt. The bias here comes in when we look at who gets plea bargains what kinds of deals they re offered and how many though innocent feel pressured to accept. Black people are of course overrepresented in the prison population. And as noted in one particular study below they re overrepresented even after you account for variables such as the crime rate among blacks. White people can compartmentalize police brutality. Black people don t have the luxury. The noknock warrant for Breonna Taylor was illegal Report Wrongful convictions have stolen at least 20000 years from innocent defendants Militarized policing doesn t reduce crime and disproportionately hits black communities New York California bills look to hold police prosecutors more accountable Charles Hobbs was sick for weeks. The staff at his Miami jail did little to help. He died alone.

But prosecutors kept insisting the impossible.

Our fourpart One in Five series examines racial inequities in America s criminal legal system as well as highlights promising reforms.  Report Report to the United Nations on Racial Disparities in the U.S. Criminal Justice System April 19 2018 The Sentencing Project submitted a report to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Contemporary Forms of Racism Racial Discrimination Xenophobia and Related Intolerance The United States criminal justice system is the largest in the world. At yearend 2015 over 6.7 million individuals1 were under some form of correctional control in the United States including 2.2 million incarcerated in federal state or local prisons and jails.2 The U.S. is a world leader in its rate of incarceration dwarfing the rate of nearly every other nation.3 Such broad statistics mask the racial disparity that pervades the U.S. criminal justice system and for African Americans in particular. African Americans are more likely than white Americans to be arrested once arrested they are more likely to be convicted and once convicted and they are more likely to experience lengthy prison sentences. AfricanAmerican adults are 5.9 times as likely to be incarcerated than whites and Hispanics are 3.1 times as likely.4 As of 2001 one of every three black boys born in that year could expect to go to prison in his lifetime as could one of every six Latinos compared to one of every seventeen white boys.5 Racial and ethnic disparities among women are less substantial than among men but remain prevalent.6 The source of such disparities is deeper and more systemic than explicit racial discrimination. The United States in effect operates two distinct criminal justice systems one for wealthy people and another for poor people and people of color. The wealthy can access a vigorous adversary system replete with constitutional protections for defendants. Yet the experiences of poor and minority defendants within the criminal justice system often differ substantially from that model due to a number of factors each of which contributes to the overrepresentation of such individuals in the system. As former Georgetown Law Professor David Cole states in his book No Equal Justice These double standards are not of course explicit on the face of it the criminal law is colorblind and classblind. But in a sense this only makes the problem worse. The rhetoric of the criminal justice system sends the message that our society carefully protects everyone s constitutional rights but in practice the rules assure that law enforcement prerogatives will generally prevail over the rights of minorities and the poor. By affording criminal suspects substantial constitutional rights in theory the Supreme Court validates the results of the criminal justice system as fair. That formal fairness obscures the systemic concerns that ought to be raised by the fact that the prison population is overwhelmingly poor and disproportionately black.7 By creating and perpetuating policies that allow such racial disparities to exist in its criminal justice system the United States is in violation of its obligations under Article 2 and Article 26 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights to ensure that all its residents regardless of race are treated equally under the law. The Sentencing Project notes that the United Nations Special Rapporteur is working to consult with U.S. civil society organizations on contemporary forms of racism racial discrimination and related intolerance. We welcome this opportunity to provide the UN Special Rapporteur with an accurate assessment of racial disparity in the U.S. criminal justice system. Established in 1986 The Sentencing Project works for a fair and effective U.S. criminal justice system by promoting reforms in sentencing policy addressing unjust racial disparities and practices and advocating for alternatives to incarceration. Staff of The Sentencing Project have testified before the U.S. Congress and state legislative bodies and have submitted amicus curiae briefs to the Supreme Court of the United States on various issues related to incarceration and criminal justice policy. The organization s research findings are regularly relied upon by policymakers and covered by major news outlets. This report chronicles the racial disparity that permeates every stage of the United States criminal justice system from arrest to trial to sentencing to post prison experiences. In particular the report highlights research findings that address rates of racial disparity and their underlying causes throughout the criminal justice system. The report concludes by offering recommendations on ways that federal state and local officials in the United States can work to eliminate racial disparity in the criminal justice system and uphold its obligations under the Covenant. In 2016 black Americans comprised 27 of all individuals arrested in the United States double their share of the total population.8 Black youth accounted for 15 of all U.S. children yet made up 35 of juvenile arrests in that year.9 What might appear at first to be a linkage between race and crime is in large part a function of concentrated urban poverty which is far more common for African Americans than for other racial groups. This accounts for a substantial portion of African Americans increased likelihood of committing certain violent and property crimes.10 But while there is a higher black rate of involvement in certain crimes white Americans overestimate the proportion of crime committed by blacks and Latinos overlook the fact that communities of color are disproportionately victims of crime and discount the prevalence of bias in the criminal justice system.11 In 1968 the Kerner Commission called on the country to make massive and sustained investments in jobs and education to reverse the segregation and poverty that have created in the racial ghetto a destructive environment totally unknown to most white Americans. 12 Fifty years later the Commission s lone surviving member concluded that in many ways things have gotten no better or have gotten worse. 13 The rise of mass incarceration begins with disproportionate levels of police contact with African Americans. This is striking in particular for drug offenses which are committed at roughly equal rates across races. One reason minorities are stopped disproportionately is because police see violations where they are said Louis Dekmar the president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police and chief of LaGrange Georgia s police department.14 The chief added Crime is often significantly higher in minority neighborhoods than elsewhere. And that is where we allocate our resources. Dekmar s view is not uncommon. Absent meaningful efforts to address societal segregation and disproportionate levels of poverty U.S. criminal justice policies have cast a dragnet targeting African Americans. The War on Drugs as well as policing policies including Broken Windows and Stop Question and Frisk sanction higher levels of police contact with African Americans. This includes higher levels of police contact with innocent people and higher levels of arrests for drug crimes. Thus In addition to pursuing policies that bring little gain in crime reduction and impose great costs on people of color policymakers and criminal justice leaders have been late to address discriminatory policies for which they provide no justification such as biased use of officer discretion and revenuedriven policing. Thus African Americans were incarcerated in local jails at a rate 3.5 times that of nonHispanic whites in 2016.27 These disparities stem in part from the policies and practices of policing described earlier but are compounded by those introduced at this stage of processing. Given that nearly twothirds 65 of people in jail in 2016 were being detained prior to trial policies and decisions influencing pretrial detention play a key role in driving the disparity in the jail population and beyond.27 Pretrial detention has been shown to increase the odds of conviction and people who are detained awaiting trial are also more likely to accept less favorable plea deals to be sentenced to prison and to receive longer sentences. Seventy percent of pretrial releases require money bond an especially high hurdle for lowincome defendants who are disproportionately people of color.29 Blacks and Latinos are more likely than whites to be denied bail to have a higher money bond set and to be detained because they cannot pay their bond.29 They are often assessed to be higher safety and flight risks because they are more likely to experience socioeconomic disadvantage and to have criminal records. Implicit bias also contributes to people of color faring worse than comparable whites in bail determinations. Although African Americans and Latinos comprise 29 of the U.S. population they make up 57 of the U.S. prison population.31 This results in imprisonment rates for AfricanAmerican and Hispanic adults that are 5.9 and 3.1 times the rate for white adults respectively and at far higher levels in some states.32 Notably these disparities exist for both the least and most serious offenses Among youth African Americans are 4.1 times as likely to be committed to secure placements as whites American Indians are 3.1 times as likely and Hispanics are 1.5 times as likely.35 Although levels of youth confinement have significantly declined in recent years the racial gap between black and American Indian versus white youth has increased.36 The racial disparities in the adult and juvenile justice systems stem in part from the policing and pretrial factors described earlier and are compounded by discretionary decisions and sentencing policies that disadvantage people of color because of their race or higher rates of socioeconomic disadvantage.20 These include During the era of mass incarceration a declining proportion of the prison population has a sentence that allows for discretionary release on parole as lawmakers have required courts to shift from indeterminate sentences whose release requires a discretionary parole decision to fixedterm sentences which have set release dates.42 Among sentences that allow for discretionary parole release the process can be harder for people of color. Some research suggests that parole boards are influenced by an applicant s race in their decision making though more research is needed in this area.43 Racial bias among correctional officers also shapes parole outcomes. As revealed by a New York Times investigation on New York prisons comparable inprison conduct a major determinant of parole decisions may result in divergent prison disciplinary records for blacks and Latinos versus whites.44 Based on an analysis of almost 60000 disciplinary cases from the state s prisons reporters found that disparities in discipline were greatest for infractions that gave discretion to guards such as disobeying a direct order. Underinvestment and racial disparities also persist in community supervision with many parole and probation systems offering supervision with little support and with evidence that parole and probation officers are more likely to revoke people of color than whites for comparable behavior. For example the Urban Institute s examination of probation revocation rates in Dallas County Texas Iowa s Sixth Judicial District Multnomah County Oregon and New York City revealed that black probationers were revoked at disproportionate rates in all study sites at levels which raise concerns about the presence of bias to the disadvantage of black probationers.  African Americans particularly black men are most exposed to the collateral consequences associated with a criminal record. In 2010 8 of all adults in the United States had a felony conviction on their record.45 Among AfricanAmerican men the rate was one in three 33.45 People with criminal records face a host of obstacles to reenter society even after they have fully completed their term of incarceration or community supervision. These include barriers to securing steady employment and housing to accessing the social safety net and federal student aid and to exercising the right to vote. Nearly onethird of U.S. workers hold jobs that require an occupational license a requirement which sometimes bars and often poses cumbersome obstacles for people with criminal records.47 In sectors that do not require licensing employers are 50 less likely to call back white job applicants with incarceration histories than comparable applicants without prison records.48 African American job applicants who are less likely to receive callbacks than whites to begin with experience an even more pronounced discrimination related to a criminal record. As scholar Devah Pager s research has revealed whites with criminal records receive more favorable treatment than blacks without criminal records.48 People with criminal convictions also face discrimination in the private rental market and those with felony drug convictions face restrictions in accessing governmentassisted housing.50 The Welfare Reform Act of 1996 imposed a lifetime denial of cash assistance and food stamps to people convicted in state or federal courts of felony drug offenses unless states opt out of the ban.51 Given the dynamics of social class and the accompanying disparate racial effects of the criminal justice system women and children of color are disproportionately impacted by this exclusionary law.51 By 2018 24 states had fully opted out of the food stamp ban 21 others had only done so in part and five states continued to fully enforce the ban.53 An even larger number of states continue to impose a partial or full ban on cash assistance for people with felony drug convictions.53 Disenfranchisement patterns have also reflected the dramatic growth and disproportionate impact of criminal convictions. A record 6.1 million Americans were forbidden from voting because of their felony record in 2016 rising from 1.2 million in 1976.55 Felony disenfranchisement rates for votingage African Americans reached 7.4 in 2016 four times the rate of nonAfrican Americans 1.8.55 In three states more than one in five votingage African Americans is disenfranchised Florida Kentucky and Tennessee.57 The majority of disenfranchised Americans are living in their communities having fully completed their sentences or remaining supervised while on probation or parole. As the research presented in this report indicates the causes of the racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system are complex and deeply rooted. As studies repeatedly demonstrate the cumulative impact of racial disparity is experienced throughout the country s criminal justice system. Beliefs that the current system is unaffected by centuries of an explicitly racist past is wishful thinking and potentially blinds decision makers to the implicit racial bias that orients the American consciousness and is embedded in its formal policies. The United States can adopt concrete measures to reduce both the existence and the effects of racial bias in its criminal justice system. As such The Sentencing Project respectfully urges the UN Special Rapporteur to recommend that the United States adopt the following recommendations. The United States should substantially end its War on Drugs. Specifically the Department of Justice should reconsider and reduce the volume of lowlevel drug offenders prosecuted in federal court. State officials can also adopt law changes to divert prisonbound defendants into effective alternatives to incarceration programs. Local police departments should significantly scale back drug arrests. The resources saved by decreasing the number of prosecutions should be invested in evidencebased drug prevention and treatment measures. The United States should eliminate mandatory minimum sentences. Judges should be allowed to consider individual case characteristics when sentencing a defendant in every case. Mandatory sentences do not eliminate discretion in the courtroom they simply shift it from judges to prosecutors thereby reducing transparency in decision making. Defendants should be detained pretrial only if they pose a safety or flight risk not because they cannot afford to post bail. A well calibrated and transparent riskassessment instrument can be used to determine who should be released on their own recognizance who should be released with some requirements and who should be detained. The United States should fully fund and staff indigent defense agencies through an appropriate mix of local state and federal resources. The federal government should increase support for training and technical assistance for indigent defense and document shortcomings of jurisdictions that fail to meet established bar association standards for caseloads and professional training. Policies should be adopted at the federal and state levels requiring the use of racial impact statements for proposed sentencing policies. Such a policy would require legislators to prepare an analysis assessing the possible disparate racial consequences of any proposed legislation before enacting it in order to avoid any unintended disparate racial effects.58 Four states Iowa Connecticut Oregon and New Jersey have adopted racial impact statement requirements since 2008. The United States should develop and implement training designed to mitigate the influence of implicit racial bias at every level of the criminal justice system police officers public defenders prosecutors judges jury members and parole boards. While it is difficult to eliminate completely racial bias at the individual level studies have repeatedly shown that it is possible to control for the effects of implicit racial bias on individual decisionmaking.59 In other words while it may be impossible in the current culture of the United States to ensure that individuals are cognitively colorblind it is possible to train individuals to be behaviorally colorblind.60 The United States should work with leading scholars on implicit bias to develop the most effective training programs and couple this with systems of monitoring and accountability to reduce the influence of implicit racial bias. Denying the right to vote to an entire class of citizens is deeply problematic to a democratic society and counterproductive to effective reentry. The federal government should allow Americans to vote regardless of their conviction status and certainly after they have concluded their sentences. States should also allow the full democratic participation of their citizens. Government officials should also revise policies that serve no public safety function but impose collateral consequences on people with criminal convictions such as in the realms of employment education housing and in the social safety net and encourage similar reforms in the private sector. For decades the United States of America has employed mass incarceration as a convenient answer to inconvenient questions. These policies have produced dramatic rates of incarceration with a particularly disproportionate impact on communities of color. In addition to the range of harmful consequences to people of color mass incarceration has been a failed policy in regard to public safety outcomes. Research has documented that the effect of imprisonment on crime rates has been modest and that at current levels the scale of incarceration is well past the point of diminishing returns for public safety. Mass incarceration has diverted resources from prevention and treatment initiatives that could have produced far more effective approaches to crime reduction. In recent years the U.S. government has addressed some of the glaring racial inequalities that permeate every aspect of its criminal justice system but these efforts have been relatively modest in scope. The government continues to both foster and perpetuate inequalities in clear violation of its obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights as well as other international agreements. The proliferation of racial disparities in the U.S. criminal justice system has a profound impact on the lives of people of color. Behind each statistic lies the face of a young black man or woman whose potential has been cut short by a harsh prison sentence mandated by draconian drug laws. Behind each percentage point lies the face of a Latina child who will only know her parents through hurried awkward visits in a prison visitation room. Behind each dataset lies a community of color bereft of hope because its young people have been locked away. It is the human face a face of color of the racial injustice of the United States criminal justice system that is the most compelling reason for reform. It is time for the United States to take affirmative steps to eliminate the racial disparities in its criminal justice system.

It is largely driven by racial disparities which directly obstruct and deconstruct our minority communities. The origins of our modernday police mentality can be traced back to the Slave Patrol. The earliest formal slave patrol was created in the Carolinas in the early 1700s with the following mission to establish a system of terror in response to slave uprisings with the capacity to pursue apprehend and return runaway slaves to their owners including the use of excessive force to control and produce desired slave behavior. Slave Patrols allowed forcible entry into any home solely based on suspicions of protecting runaway slaves. Slave Patrols continued until the end of the Civil War and the passage of the 13th Amendment.  History Explained There is an obvious disparity in how the general public view fatal encounters between police and Black people. 66 said these encounters were isolated incidents. The number of people shot to death by the police in the United States from 2017 to 2020 by race.  Source Statista The primary purpose of the court system is to try each case presented render a verdict and determine sentencing. The correctional branch of the criminal justice system involves a network of agencies that administer prisons and programs like parole and probation boards in a given jurisdiction.

The criminal justice system has clearly been biased against blacks in the past but recent evidence on such bias is far less conclusive. Many studies have been conducted that show no bias in the arrest prosecution adjudication and sentencing of blacks. At the same time many other studies show possible evidence of bias. The consensus among criminologists is that available evidence of bias is not strong. Compared to legitimate factors affecting sentencing decisions such as the defendants prior record and offense seriousness race appears to be only weakly related to whether a defendant is arrested convicted prosecuted or sentenced severely. Moreover criminologists are divided over how to interpret this weak relationship. Some believe it proves the existence of a small amount of bias in the criminal justice system while others do not believe studies rule out the alternative explanation that races differ on legal factors and these factors legitimately influence decisions of criminal justice system officials. The Bureau of Justice Statistics conducted a 1year survey in which samples of adult felony defendants were tracked as their individual cases proceeded across major criminal justice stages. The survey was based on a sample of 10226 defendants representing 42538 defendants in the Nations 75 largest counties. Survey findings revealed blacks were convicted of more serious offenses than whites had longer criminal records and were convicted in places that generally meted out more prison sentences. These differences explained why 51 percent of convicted blacks but only 38 percent of convicted whites were sent to prison. The survey provided no evidence that in places where blacks had most of their contacts with the criminal justice system the system treated them more harshly than whites.
https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2019/05/21/from-police-to-parole-black-and-white-americans-differ-widely-in-their-views-of-criminal-justice-system/, In a recent Pew Research Center survey around nineinten black adults 87 said blacks are generally treated less fairly by the criminal justice system than whites a view shared by a much smaller majority of white adults 61. And in a survey shortly before last year s midterm elections 79 of blacks compared with 32 of whites said the way racial and ethnic minorities are treated by the criminal justice system is a very big problem in the United States today. Racial differences in views of the criminal justice system are not limited to the perceived fairness of the system as a whole. Black and white adults also differ across a range of other criminal justicerelated questions asked by the Center in recent years on subjects ranging from crime and policing to the use of computer algorithms in parole decisions. Black adults in the U.S. consistently express more concern than white adults about crime. In last year s preelection survey threequarters of blacks compared with fewer than half of whites 46 said violent crime is a very big problem in the country today. And while 82 of blacks said gun violence is a very big problem in the U.S. just 47 of whites said the same. Blacks are also more likely than whites to see crime as a serious problem locally. In an early 2018 survey black adults were roughly twice as likely as whites to say crime is a major problem in their local community 38 vs. 17. That s consistent with a survey conducted in early 2017 when blacks were about twice as likely as whites to say their local community is not too or not at all safe from crime 34 vs. 15. Black adults were also more likely than whites to say they worry a lot about having their home broken into 28 vs. 13 or being the victim of a violent crime 20 vs. 8. However similar shares in both groups 22 of blacks and 18 of whites said they actually had been the victim of a violent crime. Some of the most pronounced differences between blacks and whites emerge on questions related to police officers and the work they do. A survey conducted in mid2017 asked Americans to rate police officers and other groups of people on a feeling thermometer from 0 to 100 where 0 represents the coldest most negative rating and 100 represents the warmest and most positive. Black adults gave police officers a mean rating of 47 whites gave officers a mean rating of 72. Blacks are also more likely than whites to have specific criticisms about the way officers do their jobs particularly when it comes to police interactions with their community. In the Center s survey earlier this year 84 of black adults said that in dealing with police blacks are generally treated less fairly than whites. A much smaller share of whites though still a 63 majority said the same. Blacks were also about five times as likely as whites to say they d been unfairly stopped by police because of their race or ethnicity 44 vs. 9 with black men especially likely to say this 59. Stark racial differences about key aspects of policing also emerged in a 2016 survey. Blacks were much less likely than whites to say that police in their community do an excellent or good job using the right amount of force in each situation 33 vs. 75 treating racial and ethnic groups equally 35 vs. 75 and holding officers accountable when misconduct occurs 31 vs. 70. Blacks were also substantially less likely than whites to say their local police do an excellent or good job at protecting people from crime 48 vs. 78. Notably blackwhite differences in views of policing exist among officers themselves. In a survey of nearly 8000 sworn officers conducted in the fall of 2016 black officers were about twice as likely as white officers 57 vs. 27 to say that highprofile deaths of black people during encounters with police were signs of a broader problem not isolated incidents. And roughly seveninten black officers 69 compared with around a quarter of white officers 27 said the protests that followed many of these incidents were motivated some or a great deal by a genuine desire to hold police accountable for their actions rather than by longstanding bias against the police. Several other questions in the survey also showed stark differences in the views of black and white officers. A narrow majority of Americans 54 support the death penalty for people convicted of murder according to a spring 2018 survey. But only around a third of blacks 36 support capital punishment for this crime compared with nearly sixinten whites 59. Racial divisions extend to other questions related to the use of capital punishment. In a 2015 survey 77 of blacks said minorities are more likely than whites to be sentenced to death for committing similar crimes. Whites were divided on this question 46 said minorities are disproportionately sentenced to death while the same percentage saw no racial disparities. Blacks were also more likely than whites to say capital punishment is not a crime deterrent 75 vs. 60 and were less likely to say the death penalty is morally justified 46 vs. 69. However about seveninten in both groups said they saw some risk in putting an innocent person to death 74 of blacks vs. 70 of whites. Certain aspects of the criminal justice system have changed in recent decades. One example Some states now use criminal risk assessments to assist with parole decisions. These assessments involve collecting data about people who are up for parole comparing that data with data about other people who have been convicted of crimes and then assigning inmates a score to help decide whether they should be released from prison or not. A 2018 survey asked Americans whether they felt the use of criminal risk assessments in parole decisions was an acceptable use of algorithmic decisionmaking. A 61 majority of black adults said using these assessments is unfair to people in parole hearings compared with 49 of white adults. States differ widely when it comes to allowing people with past felony convictions to vote. In 12 states people with certain felony convictions can lose the right to vote indefinitely unless other criteria such as receiving a pardon from the governor are met according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In Maine and Vermont by contrast those with felony convictions never lose the right to vote even while they are incarcerated. Twentytwo states fall somewhere between these positions rescinding voting rights only during incarceration and for a period afterward such as when former inmates are on parole. In a fall 2018 survey 69 of Americans favored allowing people convicted of felonies to vote after serving their sentences. Black adults were much more likely than white adults to somewhat or strongly favor this approach 83 vs. 68. Terms Conditions Privacy Policy Reprints Permissions Use Policy Feedback Careers
https://www.judges.org/news-and-info/most-judges-believe-the-criminal-justice-system-suffers-from-racism/, The majority of judges believe that racism is systemic in the United States criminal justice system according to the NJC s monthly survey of its alumni. In the survey emailed the first week of July 65 percent of the 634 judges who responded answered yes to the question Do you believe that systemic racism exists in the criminal justice system?   Of course it does commented one judge anonymously. The data doesn t sic lie. The burden on us judges is to first acknowledge the problem and then to work diligently to eradicate the problem.  More than 200 judges left comments with their votes and the consensus among the majority was that racism is mostly of the implicit or unconscious kind. Many people don t recognize that bias exists or are unwilling to admit it judges wrote.  But that nonawareness is no excuse insisted one anonymous judge.  Any judge who is not educated on the reality of systemic racism and implicit bias and aware of the consequences of these issues should not be on the Bench the judge wrote.  Most of the judges I know are not overtly racist and sincerely seek to treat all people equally wrote another anonymous judge but I suspect that our implicit biases impact our decisionmaking more than we realize.  The same judge suggested that systemic racism is the primary reason why black Americans and other minorities are incarcerated at higher rates than whites. Cook County IL Judge Freddrenna M. Lyle mentioned sentencing disparities between those found guilty of possessing crack vs. powdered cocaine crack being more common among lowerincome minorities as evidence of racist policies and laws. Earlier this year the College hosted a national symposium in Washington D.C. on implicit bias in judicial decisionmaking. The program focused on how to prevent bias from affecting decisions by juries. Among the judges who rejected the notion of systemic racism many expressed a belief that some people in the criminal justice system may be racist but the system itself is not.   Our system isn t perfect and individual actors may harbor prejudices based on race wrote retired Kent County RI Superior Court Judge Bennett Gallo. But those that do are vastly outnumbered by those who go about their work conscientiously and evenhandedly. I see no evidentiary basis for the contention that it is a systemic problem.  One anonymous judge accused the national news media of promoting a false narrative as a way to continue to divide this nation and discredit the thousands of good fair judges and court employees in the United States.  Each month the College emails an informal nonscientific onequestion survey to its more than 12000 judicial alumni in the United States and abroad.
