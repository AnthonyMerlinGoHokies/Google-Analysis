The case may have ramifications for the upcoming 2024 presidential election as Democrats in Pennsylvania historically vote by mail by far wider margins than Republicans. A federal appeals court must decide if Pennsylvania voters who put the wrong date on the envelope containing their mailin ballots should have their votes thrown out. The case argued Tuesday Feb. 20 2024 in Philadelphia could be significant in this year s presidential contest. AP PhotoGene J. Puskar File In the Keystone State the likely Republican nominee David McCormick and Trump seem to be ignoring each other.  Due to the Garden State s ballot that favors endorsed candidates the candidate in the column with President Biden might be different from county to county.  John Gore lawyer for the Republican groups told the court voters have a right to vote but that the date is required to help election workers determine the ballot s validity. Therefore he argued voters must follow the rules.  The right s not denied when election officials declined to count the ballot because the individual did not in fact take all action necessary to make the ballot effective he said. However Ari Savitzky of the ACLU who argued on behalf of the NAACP disagreed calling such mistakes a meaningless paperwork error.  The date is not used for anything having to do with determining a voter s qualifications he told the justices. It s not used to determine their identity. It s not used to determine whether they voted on time.  The League of Women Voters Common Cause the Black Political Empowerment Project and other groups joined the NAACP in the suit. It is unknown whether the court will render a decision in time for the presidential election this Tuesday Nov. 5.

https://www.lakevotes.gov/Home/ArtMID/32399/ArticleID/7529/Vote-by-Mail-Counter-Pick-Ups-Continues-for-the-2024-Presidential-Preference-Primary,   May 14th City of Clermont Special ElectionCity Council Seat 2Qualified Candidates Tod HowardOtis Taylor Jr. In today s world of 24hour news cycles social media and the everpresent rumor mill many false statements are being made about the actions of elections administrators and processes. People who have absolutely NO experience whatsoever in elections administration are making and have made statements that are patently false. Many other statements that are misleading and only partially true have undermined the confidence of the voters unfairly. It is our hope that by reading the following FACTS you will know the truth about elections administered in Florida. In 2000 the Florida elections community was the laughingstock of the world. In the 2018 2020 and 2022 elections Florida was the model for the nation in successful elections administration. This status of being the nation s model occurred only by the diligent work of many Supervisors of Elections SOE and their devoted teams. In cooperation with the Legislature and the Secretary of State the elections professionals of Florida rose to the challenge and excelled. The Supervisor of Elections and the team of workers are regulated very closely by Florida Statutes and rules promulgated by the Division of Elections in Tallahassee. Most of the work we do is dictated by those statutes and rules. All votes cast in Florida are on paper ballots. Those ballots are retained for 22 months after each election then shredded. All counties must use electronic tabulation systems that have been certified by the Bureau of Standards of the Division of Elections in Tallahassee. NONE of the tabulation machines are ever connected to the internet. The election night transmission of UNOFFICIAL results to the SOE o ces does NOT use the internet. That data is transmitted via a system that resembles an interstate highway with no exits and no entry ramps. The tabulation data is stored on memory sticks that are returned to the SOE o ce on election night. That data is downloaded the next day and compared to the transmitted data of the previous evening to con rm its accuracy. Many counties Lake is one have a separate verification system into which every voted ballot is scanned. The totals of this second system are compared with those of the tabulation system. This enables us to audit the entire election instead of the previous practice of auditing only one contest in a few precincts. There are three wellproven ways to vote in Florida VotebyMail VBM Early Voting in person and Election Day in person. Each of those are signi cantly controlled by Florida Statutes. The SOE does have some control of the number of days and the hours of Early Voting but everything else is by statute. VotebyMail ballots are mailed ONLY to those voters who have requested to receive one. EVERY returned ballot MUST be in a separate envelope and the envelope must be signed by the voter whose name is printed on the envelope. EVERY envelope signature is checked through a combination of technology and trained personnel to validate the signature on the envelope compared to the signature on le in that voter s record. If the envelope signature does not match the signature on le the voter is notified of the issue and informed of the process and the deadline to rectify the problem. Each person requesting a VBM ballot has an opportunity to enroll in the BallotTrax program that notifies them quickly if there is an issue with their signature. In addition to the signature notification the same system notifies the voter when the ballot has been mailed when it has been received by our o ce and when the ballot is counted. The selection of the polling sites for Early Voting and Election Day voting is again controlled by statute. Each site must meet speci c criteria. We are allowed only one Early Voting site that is not owned by a governmental agency. No voted ballots are ever left in a polling site overnight. Every voted ballot is returned to our o ce that evening. Those ballots are under a strict chain of custody record and are always carried by at least two people. Transparency and accountability are standard operating procedures for our team. In the design of our building we intentionally placed in the internal walls more than 144 square feet of windows so people can observe the actions in each room. This is supplemented with video feeds of various ballot processes ballot opening duplication adjudication and storage. Our website has o ered tours of our building two days each week for the last 5 years. We have invested signi cantly more than 100000 into enhanced cybersecurity measures and all our systems are monitored at all times. All sta members undergo background checks are engaged in continual training and are encouraged to pursue professional development. Many counties Lake is one have a separate verification system into which every voted ballot is scanned. The totals of this second system are compared with those of the tabulation system. This enables us to audit the entire election instead of the previous practice of auditing only one contest in a few precincts. These are the FACTS. I and my staff are proud to serve our community as elections professionals. Please feel welcome to contact my office should you have questions or to schedule a facility tour. We want you to have confidence in us and in the elections processes. Thank you for the priviledge of serving as your Supervisor of Elections.

HARRISBURG Election experts in Pennsylvania expect largely smooth sailing at the polls this week anticipating the unofficial results for most races on the April 23 ballot will be available on election night. Pennsylvania has been holding elections using noexcuse mail voting since 2019 and the state has steadily moved from persistent delays in reporting results to relatively quick turnarounds. This has been accomplished mostly thanks to workers increasing familiarity with the mail process and state grants allowing counties to upgrade their equipment.  I would expect almost all counties to be able to report an overwhelming number of those ballots on election night said Jeff Greenburg a former Mercer County election director who now works for the goodgovernment group Committee of Seventy. He added that there could be a few that stretch into Wednesday.  On the ballot are candidates for president and U.S. Senate though those races are essentially decided on both sides of the aisle. More lively are the races for Pennsylvania s three row offices both the Democratic and Republican attorney general primaries have multiple candidates and there are competitive Democratic primaries for treasurer and auditor general. Final outcomes for most of the races in both chambers will be decided in the primary thanks in part to legislative maps that have created a relatively small number of truly swingable districts. Races to watch include those of state House Minority Leader Bryan Cutler who is being challenged from the right for his Lancaster County district and Democratic state Rep. Amen Brown who faces two challengers to his left in a West Philly district that has in recent years seen repeated turnover in its representation. As of Friday morning the Pennsylvania Department of State had approved nearly 896000 applications for mail ballots it approved 1.82 million during the presidential primary in 2020. That year just under 80 of voters returned those mail ballots according to the department. Voters who have already filled out and returned their mail ballots may have noticed several changes from previous years. The department put these in place to cut down on common ballot errors like failing to sign or date them misdating them or forgetting to use an interior secrecy envelope according to Secretary of the Commonwealth Al Schmidt.  Since the 2020 election cycle thousands of mail ballots have not been able to be counted because of errors that voters made while completing their mail ballots Schmidt said in one of several recent daily updates on election preparations. The redesigned ballots include an instruction sheet that has graphics. The interior secrecy envelope is now yellow which Schmidt says is intended to distinguish it more clearly from the outer envelope. The outer envelope also has a colored stripe to help the Postal Service identify election mail and it includes a revised section for dating and signing the ballot that highlights where these elements must go. The redesign also is in part an acknowledgment of the state laws and court rulings currently dictating Pennsylvania s mail voting rules. The handling of undated and misdated ballots in particular is still under active litigation. The most recent decision on the subject saw a threejudge panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rule that ballots must be properly dated. If a voter fails to date an outer ballot envelope or writes a clearly incorrect date such as their birthday counties must reject the ballot. Voting rights groups are appealing the ruling on the grounds that a missing or incorrect date is an immaterial error and that rejecting these ballots disenfranchises eligible voters. However the status quo will not change before the primary election. There also remain several areas of state law in which there is no consistent statewide rule. Counties can decide whether to offer remote drop boxes for mail ballot returns. And they can decide whether to offer ballot curing in which election officials notify voters of mail ballot mistakes before Election Day. In an email to Spotlight PA a Pennsylvania Department of State spokesperson said that it encourages counties to allow curing so that voters are not needlessly disenfranchised.  Over the past several years county election officials have pushed for changes in state law they say would allow them to process mail ballots more quickly and easily in particular they want precanvassing. At the moment election workers can only start processing mail ballots at 7 a.m. on Election Day. Allowing this to begin ahead of Election Day is a common practice among states with widespread mail voting. The legislature has failed to OK this change frustrating voting rights advocates like Greenburg. He told Spotlight PA Even a few days of preprocessing if authorized by the General Assembly would eliminate this question and uncertainty about the timing of results altogether.   It remains ridiculous that this simple election administration improvement hasnt been enacted he said. Counties have been able to make other updates to their processes thanks in large part to state grants the legislature authorized in 2022. The law creating the grants also required counties to tabulate ballots continuously through the night to get their counts done more quickly and also allowed them to purchase new tech that speeds up the process. One piece of technology counties are increasingly adopting is the electronic pollbook. Some voters may see these pollbooks for the first time this primary. From a voter perspective the update is relatively minor. Epollbooks are tablets that replace the paper pollbooks voters have traditionally used to sign in voters. They can make the signin process quicker but the biggest differences that come with their use happen behind the scenes. In particular epollbooks dramatically speed up the process of pollbook reconciliation which involves election workers scanning every voter s name into the commonwealth s Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors or SURE system to verify that nobody voted more than once. With paper pollbooks that involves individually scanning a barcode beside every voter s name. With electronic ones it happens at the touch of a button. As of the November 2023 municipal election 25 of the commonwealth s 67 counties were using electronic pollbooks up from 19 in last year s May primary. I hope you appreciated this article.

Stephen MaturenGetty Images Fearing that Democrats hold a crucial edge in ballots cast before Election Day national Republicans are working to convince their voters to take advantage of mail and early voting this year.  We can t play catch up. We can t start from behind. We can t let Dems get a big head start and think we re going to win it all on Election Day Republican National Committee chair Ronna McDaniel said in November on a conference call aimed at promoting the group s Bank Your Vote initiative to encourage early and mail voting. Things happen on Election Day.  But the party s army of lawyers is more quietly sending a very different message. The RNC is fighting in courtrooms and legal filings in key election battlegrounds across the country to make it harder to cast a mail ballot and to have it counted. On Feb. 20 attorneys for the RNC were in a federal courtroom in Philadelphia in a bid to require that Pennsylvania throw out mail ballots with missing or incorrect dates. Eleven days earlier they filed a lawsuit challenging several provisions of Arizona s newly adopted election rules including a rule allowing voters who have not shown proof of citizenship to cast a mail ballot. And that same day they asked a court in Georgia to uphold a state law that imposes stricter rules on mail voting. Separately in recent months the RNC has asked courts to let it join the defense of laws in Ohio Wisconsin and North Carolina that similarly impose tighter rules on mail voting judges in the latter two states denied the requests while the Ohio motion was approved. The party also has sued to block a New York law that lets people vote by mail without an excuse the state s Supreme Court this month dismissed the complaint. And it has formally weighed in against proposed changes to Nevada s election rules including one that makes it easier for election officials to prevent volunteer observers from disrupting the counting of mail ballots. In January the RNC went further than ever filing a lawsuit in Mississippi that it has said aims to obtain a nationwide ban on mail ballots that arrive after Election Day. RNC lawyers stated plainly in their complaint that Republicans interests are at stake because mail voting tends to favor Democrats. Though it s received relatively little attention the RNC s legal onslaught could have a major impact on the 2024 elections. Pennsylvania Georgia Arizona Wisconsin North Carolina and Nevada are all set to be among the closest states in this year s presidential race while Pennsylvania Ohio Arizona Wisconsin and Nevada host pivotal U.S. Senate contests. New York meanwhile is home to several swing congressional districts that could determine control of the U.S. House. And the legal effort against mail voting has been matched by a legislative one. Thirteen states including Florida Texas North Carolina Arizona and Ohio have passed 16 bills to restrict mail voting since the start of 2023 according to a database run by the Voting Rights Lab. It all amounts to a multipronged effort to suppress voting by mail voting advocates say one that could threaten access to the ballot this fall especially for Democrats who are now more likely than Republicans to use mail voting. At its core are legal arguments aimed at convincing judges to interpret the law in ways that are explicitly adverse to voters. The push sits uneasily alongside an RNC campaign to convince GOP voters to embrace mail and early voting. But it s right in keeping with former President Donald Trump s yearslong evidencefree campaign against voting by mail.  In courtrooms and state legislatures across the country Republicans are doing everything in their power to restrict mailin voting said Marc Elias a prominent Democratic election lawyer in a statement. The RNC s legal strategy is clear. The Republican Party no longer seeks to earn the support of a majority of the American electorate. Instead they are launching a legal assault on our democracy.  A spokesman for the RNC did not respond to a request for comment. In 2020 many states loosened rules on mail voting in response to COVID19. That year s election saw record high turnout despite the pandemic with nearly half of all voters casting a mail ballot a huge increase from around 22 in 2016. Even with COVID19 tamed many states have kept their more liberal mail voting rules in place or like New York have passed new laws expanding access to mail ballots. While leading Democrats have embraced mail voting Trump has repeatedly denounced it falsely claiming it opens the door to massive fraud.  MILLIONS OF MAILIN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES Trump tweeted in June 2020 adding that the result would be a RIGGED election. It s true that several of the extremely rare instances of proven voter fraud have involved mail voting. But there s no evidence of systematic mail voter fraud of the kind that Trump has claimed threatens the integrity of a presidential election. A voter fraud database run by The Heritage Foundation a conservative think tank lists 279 cases of fraudulent use of absentee ballots going back to 1988 since which time hundreds of millions of mail ballots have been cast. Feds deliver stark warnings to state election officials ahead of November  Meanwhile GOP lawyers have gone to the mat to try to put the mail voting genie back in the bottle.  We ve watched Democrats systematically try to codify those postCOVID changes that they made and we ve been in the courts trying to keep those preCOVID protections in place for our elections RNC chair Ronna McDaniel explained in October. There s been a battle waged.  It s not surprising then that Democrats have in recent elections used mail voting at significantly higher rates than Republicans. So pronounced is the split that in 2020 President Joe Biden won the mail vote in 14 out of 15 states analyzed by 538.com while Trump likewise won the Election Day vote in 14 out of 15. That s led the GOP to fret that it now often goes into Election Day already trailing by a significant margin. In response the RNC last year launched the Bank Your Vote initiative to encourage Republicans to vote early or by mail. The effort includes websites in all 50 states and even an ad recorded by Trump albeit without much visible enthusiasm.  Sign up and commit to voting early Trump says. We must defeat the far left at their own game.   You know we have these elections that last for 62 days Trump declared last month in his victory speech after the Iowa caucuses. And if you need some more time take as much time as you want. And so many bad things happen. We have to get rid of mailin ballots because once you have mailin ballots you have crooked elections.  The RNC s legal assault on mail voting suggests a similar view. In several court filings RNC lawyers have suggested that tight safeguards are needed to ensure mail voting doesn t allow for fraudulent votes. Ohio s law that restricts who can return a mail ballot on behalf of a voter should be upheld the RNC argued in one typical filing because it guards against an increased risk of voter fraud and other irregularities.  The Republican bid to restrict mail voting is part of a larger effort by the party since 2020 to devote more resources to election integrity tighter election rules that prioritize antifraud measures over access. It includes a yearround election integrity legal department which has said it worked with over 90 law firms and participated in nearly 100 lawsuits during the 2022 cycle. So far this cycle the RNC has paid over 4 million to two top Republican law firms Consovoy McCarthy and Wiley Rein according to FEC records. Thomas McCarthy a cofounder of Consovoy McCarthy is listed on RNC motions in the Mississippi Georgia and Wisconsin cases among others. The focus on election integrity comes as McDaniel the RNC chair is reported to be stepping down at the end of the month. Trump s choice to replace her North Carolina GOP chair Michael Whatley has stressed the importance of tight voting rules for Republican success States Newsroom has reported. The most farreaching of the RNC s cases is the lawsuit it filed with other Republicans in January against a Mississippi law that allows mail ballots that arrive up to five days after an election to be counted as long as they re postmarked by Election Day. Federal law sets Election Day as the Tuesday after the first Monday in November the suit argues so by extending the election past that day Mississippi is violating federal law. The RNC has said the goal is to obtain a ruling from a judge that bars postElectionDay ballots from being counted not just in Mississippi but nationwide. The 5th Circuit which contains Mississippi is known as perhaps the most conservative judicial circuit in the country. Election law experts have said it s unlikely but not impossible that a court could accept the RNC s argument. In face of threats election workers vow You are not disrupting the democratic process   If the case were to reach the Supreme Court at least one justice appears friendly. In 2020 when the court upheld Wisconsin s ban on latearriving ballots Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote that states have the right to set election deadlines to avoid the chaos and suspicions of impropriety that can ensue when thousands of absentee ballots flow in after election day and potentially flip the results of an election.  Mississippi is one of 18 states including key battlegrounds like Ohio Nevada Virginia Texas and New York plus the District of Columbia that count ballots that arrive after Election Day. North Carolina last year passed a law that restricts mail voting in several ways including by banning ballots that arrive after Election Day. It s that law that the RNC sought unsuccessfully to help defend from a court challenge by Democrats which is ongoing. The number of votes at issue could be significant. In 2020 the U.S. Postal Service said it processed nearly 190000 ballots in the two days after the election. Most of those it said were in states that allow latearriving ballots. The Mississippi lawsuit makes clear that despite the Bank Your Vote campaign Republicans want to curtail mail voting because they think it gives Democrats an edge.  Because voting by mail is starkly polarized by party allowing latearriving ballots directly harms Plaintiffs the RNC s lawyers wrote in the complaint. For example according to the MIT Election Lab 46 of Democratic voters in the 2022 General Election mailed in their ballots compared to only 27 of Republicans. That means the latearriving mailin ballots that are counted for five additional days disproportionately break for Democrats.  The Pennsylvania case is another that could reverberate. In November 2022 the state Supreme Court ruled in response to a suit filed by the RNC and other Republicans that over 10000 mail ballots on which the voter had neglected to write the date on the outer envelope or had written an incorrect date must be rejected. The state s NAACP chapter filed its own suit in federal court in response. The RNC quickly intervened arguing that the state Supreme Court s ruling should be upheld. A district court ruled for the NAACP in November finding that the Civil Rights Act bars states from rejecting votes based on immaterial paperwork errors. The RNC appealed arguing for a narrower interpretation of the landmark civil rights law setting up the Feb. 20 hearing. In a sign that the case could have an impact beyond Pennsylvania 17 Republicanled states last month submitted an amicus brief in support of the RNC s position. The other cases may not have the same reach as those two. But together they broadly aim to tighten the rules around mail voting to a degree that could significantly chip away at mail votes. RNC lawyers have marshaled a range of arguments in these cases. They have claimed unsuccessfully that New York s law expanding access to mail voting violates the state s constitution which bans noexcuse mail voting. They ve said Georgia s new deadline to apply for a mail ballot of seven days before Election Day doesn t violate the federal law barring deadlines of fewer than 11 days because the federal government lacks the authority to regulate these deadlines. No mail voting rule appears too small to escape the notice of RNC lawyers. This month s lawsuit against Arizona targets a new rule that lets voters who registered without proof of citizenship and therefore under Arizona law can vote in federal elections only receive a mail ballot arguing that state law bars these voters from voting by mail. And they ve submitted comments to a Nevada commission criticizing a proposed rule there that gives election officials more power to ensure the counting process for mail ballots isn t disrupted. The new powers could let election officials infringe on the public s right to witness the counting the group s lawyers assert. Meanwhile supporters of mail voting say Republican fears about an influx of Democratic mail votes may be misplaced.  Americans have used mail ballots for over a hundred years because they provide a safe and convenient way to ensure the right to vote said Barbara Smith Warner the executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute which advocates for mail voting. Research has demonstrated time and time again that voting at home increases voter participation and turnout for all with no partisan advantage for any side.   Attacks on mail ballots are red herrings to distract from their true intent making it harder for citizens to vote and sowing distrust in our elections Smith Warner said. by Zachary Roth Stateline February 22 2024 by Zachary Roth Stateline February 22 2024 Fearing that Democrats hold a crucial edge in ballots cast before Election Day national Republicans are working to convince their voters to take advantage of mail and early voting this year.

A lawsuit filed last week in Mississippi follows a similar one last year in North Dakota both brought in heavily Republican states before conservative federal courts. Democratic and voting rights groups are concerned about the potential impact beyond those two states if a judge rules that deadlines for receiving mailed ballots that stretch past Election Day Nov. 5 violate federal law. They say it s possible such a decision would lead to a nationwide injunction similar to one last year when a Texas judge temporarily paused the Food and Drug Administration s approval of the abortion pill mifepristone.  This effort risks disenfranchising Mississippi voters but we don t want that to also be precedent for other states Abhi Rahman communications director of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee said in response to the most recent lawsuit.

That includes political swing states such as Nevada. Some states including Colorado Oregon and Utah rely heavily on mail voting. Former President Donald Trump has long railed against the use of mail voting in particular when many states expanded its use during the COVID19 pandemic in 2020 when the Republican lost his reelection bid to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump has falsely claimed that changing vote tallies after Election Day are an indication of widespread fraud. In the wake of his loss several Republicancontrolled states moved to tighten rules around mail voting.

It argues that Mississippi improperly extends the federal election beyond the election date set by Congress and that as a result timely valid ballots are diluted by untimely invalid ballots.   Federal law is very clear Election Day is the Tuesday after the first Monday in November RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. However some states accept and count ballots days and days after Election Day and we believe that practice is wrong.  RNC spokesperson Gates McGavick said the group hopes for a ruling before the presidential election that state deadlines allowing ballots to be received after Election Day violate federal law.  This case could have major ramifications in future elections not just in Mississippi but across the country he said. The Democratic National Committee said it is watching the cases closely and will fight any attempt to disenfranchise voters.  Democrats will always stand on the side of voters against unlawful attacks on Americans fundamental right to make their voices heard at the ballot box DNC deputy press secretary Nina Raneses said in a statement.

Republicans are challenging extended mail ballot deadlines in at least two states in a move that could have severe implications for mail voting nationwide ahead of this year s presidential election. AP PhotoJack Dura File Democratic state Rep. Bryant Clark called the Mississippi lawsuit another effort to try to stifle votes and stop the votes of a certain segment of the population. He said the suit may also lead to similar efforts across the country. Thessalia Merivaki a political science professor at Mississippi State University said the state s mail voting process is already difficult to navigate and that eliminating the fiveday window would unfairly punish voters. In North Dakota a similar federal lawsuit against the state election director was filed by the conservative Public Interest Legal Foundation on behalf of a county auditor Mark Splonskowski who cited what he said is a conflict between state and federal law. A court is expected to decide soon whether he has the legal right to bring the lawsuit. Foundation spokesperson Lauren Bowman said while the lawsuit deals with North Dakota s law a ruling that finds extended ballot deadlines violate federal law would affect other states with similar policies. State Election Director Erika White has asked the case to be dismissed. Her attorneys characterized the county auditor s lawsuit as a bid to overthrow longstanding North Dakota law and rewrite it according to his own preference. Attorneys with the U.S. Justice Department s Civil Rights Division filed a statement of interest in the case defending the existing state law saying it was consistent with federal law and ensures that military and overseas ballots would be counted. North Dakota Republican Secretary of State Michael Howe declined to comment citing the pending litigation. Republican state Sen. Kristin Roers said the lawsuit could have unintended consequences such as for military voters and would effectively penalize voters who live in areas with slow postal service.  I don t see that this is something that is a huge glaring issue in our election system she said. Richard L. Hasen a University of California Los Angeles law professor and election law expert criticized the legal basis of the lawsuits. In the Mississippi case he said the RNC appears to be trying to gain a political advantage because it believes latearriving mail ballots are more likely to favor Democrats.  He noted that the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals which includes Mississippi has historically been quite conservative and not protective of voting rights.   It would be a far reach for a challenge to Mississippi law to lead to a national injunction against this he said. But it s possible.

https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/republicans-trump-mail-voting-resistance-rnc-rcna145599,  I tried to give them a mailin ballot application and could only get out about 300 Tom Eddy head of the county s Republican Party said. Every one of them said either No that s not the right way to vote or Trump does not agree with it.  What happened in Erie County is emblematic of the ongoing feud within the GOP over one of the most fundamental elements of elections how to vote. And it reflects a strain at a critical time for the party when national and battleground polling has shown the 2024 presidential election could be won at the margins.  National Republicans are attempting a shift to embrace mailin and early voting to match what s been a Democratic advantage in recent years.  But interviews with nearly 20 Republican officials and voters across the country say there is lingering and sometimes fierce resistance to the idea from Trump on down. The schism signals potential peril for the party in the fall if it once again fails to match Democrats ontheground ballot organization.  It starts at the top. As the leader of the Republican Party Trump has used his position to blast without evidence mailin voting as a Trojan horse for widespread voter fraud. In the process the former president has eroded trust in a method that was once widely embraced by many people in his party putting Republicans at a disadvantage against Democrats.  Bruce Parks chair of the Washoe County GOP in nevada on mailin voting  Mailin voting is totally corrupt Trump said bluntly during a February rally in Michigan. In his stump speeches written remarks often include a plug for mailin voting but Trump struggles to recite the lines without casting doubt on earlyvoting options. Trump won Erie County for instance by 1500 votes in 2016 but lost it by 1200 votes in 2020. Eddy who said he personally prefers voting in person added that he believes Trump lost there four years ago because of Republicans reluctance to use mail ballots.  I think Trump can win Erie County but I have to get Republicans to accept the mailin ballot he said.  Republican officials at the national and local levels widely say they prefer voting in person but many concede times have changed and they need to build up a votebymail operation to mitigate huge investments Democrats have made in recent years.  Trump and all of our topoftheticket leaders need to make it clear If you re an infrequent voter use whatever means necessary said Brandon Maly chair of the Dane County GOP in Wisconsin.  But that is easier said than done. There remains a large swath of passionate Trump voters including some party officials who are taking their cues from the former president.  I always vote in person. Don t trust mailin voting said Linda Ragsdale a 66yearold twotime Trump voter from Ohio. Things conveniently get lost. Especially when concerned with Trump votes.  In the critical Washoe County in Nevada a swing county that could help make or break the battleground state for Republicans the county chair wants nothing to do with mailin voting.  Absolutely not. It s horrific Washoe County GOP Chair Bruce Parks said. It s the worst system in the entire universe.  Leo Blundo GOP chair in Nevada s Nye County holds similar reservations saying that instead of advocating for mailin voting in the fall he and others with the party plan to go doortodoor to personally collect ballots from voters put them in a secure box and drop them off at the local clerk s office.  Blundo made clear he didn t trust the mail. He asked sarcastically whether a voter would take a 100 bill and put it in the mailbox.   Yeah you trust the mail? Ship it he said. Let s see if it gets there.  Trump likewise has spent years hammering mailinballots at a time when the process has become increasingly popular. Mail ballots peaked during the pandemicplagued 2020 election cycle at 43 million according to the MIT Election Data Science Lab. That number dropped to 31 million during the 2022 midterms a falloff that was expected because there were no pandemicera voting restrictions and midterm elections generally have lower turnout than presidential elections. It was still up substantially from the 23 million mail ballots cast during the 2018 midterms.  Despite the spiking popularity Trump has maintained that the institution of mail voting is inherently riddled with fraud and abuse. In 2020 Trump filed several lawsuits in key states trying to stop votecounting or force recounts after his campaign said postElection Day increases in vote totals for President Joe Biden much of which came from mail ballots which were counted after the inperson votes were evidence of fraud.  None of the lawsuits were successful and FBI officials at the time said there was no evidence to back up Trump s claims that mail ballots increase the chances of fraud. The position has put Trump s handpicked leadership team at the Republican National Committee in a bind. Many party leaders at both the national and state levels continue to believe that voting by mail is a helpful political tool but they must urge their voters to at least consider the practice without attracting the wrath of the man who controls the party.  Programs at the RNC focusing on early voting ballot harvesting where legal absentee ballot and mail in programs will continue to be enhanced Trumpbacked RNC Chair Michael Whatley wrote to his members in a memo last week. Our Bank Your Vote program will continue educating and empowering voters to feel confident in early voting and voting by mail.  In a followup memo last week Whatley again emphasized the need to vote by mail.  Encouraging our voters to utilize early voting and votebymail are top priorities as we reorganize our political operation at the RNC wrote Whatley who estimated that more than half of all 2024 voters will vote before Election Day. National Republicans think that Trump s concerns about mailin voting are valid but they said that does not mean the party should not continue to encourage people to vote in many different ways.  Both things can and do coexist Trump spokesperson Danielle Alvarez said when asked about Trump s aversion to mail voting and the party s desire to continue it. Different states have different rules because elections are state by state. There are states with bad laws on the books and we want to be aggressive in ensuring that elections are safe and secure.   At the same time we have to play by the rules we are given and we will bank votes for President Trump she added using a term that refers to campaigns collecting or banking votes ahead of Election Day.  Lara Trump the former president s daughterinlaw whom he recently installed as RNC cochair told NBC News that Trump is now very much embracing early voting even though just last month he said that you automatically have fraud with voting by mail.  Republican candidates and officials across the country hope she is right as the party tries not only to retake the White House but win key congressional races to recapture the Senate and keep the House.   The election laws did change and Republicans ought to take every opportunity that the law allows which includes harvesting voting by mail voting early Sam Brown the frontrunner to become the Republican nominee for Senate in Nevada said. And I ve seen there s been a shift and sort of a recognition that we ought to embrace the full spectrum of methods and opportunities and time for us to vote.  His state party learned the hard way in the 2022 midterms when Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto won the closely watched race in a key contest that helped Democrats win the Senate. She won by fewer than 8000 votes after Democrats with the help of the powerful Culinary Workers Union mounted a massive ground game that included a robust votebymail effort.  Republicans meanwhile complained repeatedly about the problems of voter fraud in the state.  Complicating matters is the fact Republicans will be at a significant financial disadvantage upanddown the ballot in 2024. Biden and a constellation of Democratic committees announced they raised 53 million in February and have 155 million cash on hand. Trump and the RNC had 42 million in the bank headed into March. Statelevel political parties are heavily reliant on national parties to fund much of their basic operations during a presidential election including things like building programs designed to increase the number of people who sign up for mail ballots then chase those ballots to make sure people who request them actually cast them. Democrats have been more quicker to embrace mailin voting in recent election cycles.Sait Serkan Gurbuz AP fileA Republican operative in Georgia said the RNC s money problems are real and would affect everyone not just Trump.   I don t think state parties in places like Arizona Wisconsin and Michigan are going to be able to raise money to fund these programs in a real way the operative said. The person added that because Democrats will push heavily for both early voting and voting by mail the problem for Republicans will be exacerbated as it will be more expensive and inefficient to continue to target voters up until Election Day.  Every Republican campaign in the country is going to be outspent by Democrats this year we know that the Georgia operative said. And if you can t bank your vote through mail voting you spend so much money in the final weeks of the campaign trying to reach people.  Some longtime Republican operatives in other presidential battleground states said that mail ballot programs will continue but likely in a quieter way.   They will do the usual chase said Andrew Hitt the Wisconsin GOP s former executive director referring to the practice of making sure voters send in the ballots they receive in the mail. I did it in 2020 and I can t imagine that changing.   It will be a behindthescenes effort that no one sees he added. They won t talk about it but they will be pressing hard.  In Arizona another presidential battleground state some Republicans will also continue to push for voting by mail even though key party leaders including Arizona Republican Party Chair Kelli Ward and Senate candidate Kari Lake have sided with Trump in advocating for inperson Election Day voting.  Lake a staunch Trump ally does not overtly encourage people to avoid voting by mail but she remains skeptical of the process.  I d like to get back to Election Day not election month where we count the votes on Election Day and we know the results at night she said. But we re not in that world right now. So we got to vote the way we have it. And that is vote early.  Shiree Verdone a longtime Republican operative in Arizona who cochaired both of Trump s state campaigns is much more blunt about her support of voting by mail.  Too many things can happen on Election Day. The kids can get sick. It can rain or whatever she said. The safest way for Republicans to vote is by mail.   I think it s insane to try to stop that she said. It puts us at a total disadvantage.  Natasha KoreckiNatasha Korecki is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.
