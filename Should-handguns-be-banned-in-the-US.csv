https://yipinstitute.org/article/why-handguns-should-be-banned, email protected Inquirydriven this article reflects personal views aiming to enrich problemrelated discourse. When the founding fathers wrote the second amendment and declared that everyone has the right to bear arms they likely did not anticipate the conditions of a future society. A future society that would no longer face the threat of a colonial empire. A future society that would develop gun technology capable of firing rounds upon rounds of bullets without a need to reload. A future society that would use guns as a form of violence rather than protection. A future society that would have 20000 gun violence deaths in just one year Cited One. A future society that would have gun violence death rates thirtyfive times that of the country they had declared independence from Cited Two. Future society that is our reality today. In the past few years the gun control debate has been largely limited to just universal background checks. The debate should not end there it must extend to a ban on all semiautomatic guns for civilian use.  It is important to establish why the current liberal view on gun control of universal background checks does not extend far enough. Several studies have found that while universal background checks can ensure that some people cannot buy guns on their own they don t have an impact on gun deaths. For example a study on the effect of comprehensive background checks repeals by Indian and Teneensse found that the repeals led to no statistically significant change in gun violence deaths Cited 3. The problem is that it is quite difficult to impose background checks that are thorough enough leaving a wide range of loopholes. Additionally background checks don t account for how criminals actually get their guns. A Bureau of Justice Statistics survey found that only 10 of criminals who used a gun in their offense obtained it from a retail source. So where are criminals getting their guns from? The same survey finds that 25 of them received it from a family or friend 43 received it from an underground market for stolen weapons 6.4 received it from direct theft and the remainder found it at a crime scene Cited 4. Such statistics make it clear that the problem is not law abiding or nonlaw abiding citizens it is the widespread distribution of guns. Therefore background checks or any other measure aimed at keeping guns in the hands of law abiding citizens are futile as criminals do not obtain their guns legally anyways.   Now that it is clear that the main problem is the widespread distribution of guns before moving on it is important to refute a key arguement made by progun supporters the second amendment argument. The fallback to the second amendment which states that the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed has been a common argument of progun supporters. However how does the constitution define the type of arms that citizens have the right to? Does that include weapons such as nuclear bombs? Asking that simple question highlights how the second amendment does not irrefutably dictate what arms are allowed and which aren t making it subject to US policymaking. Additionally this type of argument does not establish whether owning guns is right or wrong as it merely utilizes the appeal to authority logical fallacy.   Moving on progun supporters continue to oppose gun bans because they argue that guns are needed for self defense. However that argument fails on multiple fronts. Initially where are these criminals getting the guns that protection is needed from? Well according to the aforementioned data they are getting them from legal gun owners themselves. Again the problem is less of who has the gun but rather that there are so many guns. If a semiautomatic weapon ban was imposed then the overall circulation of guns would decrease making it harder for criminals to obtain guns in the first place. Furthermore progun supporters also argue that if a ban was imposed that lawabdiing citizens would be stripped of their guns while criminals would still retain them. That is true. Yes the proportion between gun ownership of lawabiding citizens and criminals would be changed however the decrease in gun circulation would mean less criminals would possess guns overall. That means the total amount of violent crime would go down. However pro gun supporters are still not consoled as they argue that they would still in the end be unable to protect themselves. They fail to understand though that guns are not exactly protecting them. A national crime victimization survey conducted between 2007 and 2011 involving 14000 incidents found that after any protective action such as hiding calling the police or running away only 4.2 of victims were injured. In comparison when guns were used as self defense 4.1 of victims were injured Cited 5. The data shows that using guns as self defense is not more effective than any other protective measure a person might take voiding the self defense argument.  So what happens when all the evidence is corroborated? A ban on semiautomatic weapons would lead to a lower circulation of guns as most criminals obtain their guns illegally. That lower circulation of guns would mean that less violent crime would occur. Reassure the rate of injury would not increase from the lack of gun ownership as data proves that self defense gun usage is not any more effective than other protective measures. Progun supporters have continually used arbiatry and not data driven evidence to argue for an item responsible for widespread grief and pain. That needs to end. Guns need to be banned.  Alper.

The discourse surrounding the welfare state in the US and the Western world writ large has undoubtedly shifted rightward since the 1980s. There are many reasons for this but the biggest one is the myth of welfare dependency. My goal here is to critically examine the concept of welfare dependency itself and challenge its characterization as a real issue. The purpose is not to deny that welfare fraud exists or that stealing is good but rather that government intervention to protect people and grow the economy is justified even if it costs more and that rightwing arguments on the topic are fundamentally flawed. One of Asia s most important diplomatic wars is being waged somewhere else entirely the South Pacific. Taiwan is on the defensive as China gradually wins over its allies with economic aid while the United States concerns itself with the struggle s implications for its own position in the region. You ve been elected leader of your country. What would you say during your inaugural address to inspire the citizens of your country including those of every race religion political party and creed?
https://www.voicesofyouth.org/blog/should-guns-be-banned, Nowadays it is nearly impossible for a year to go by without a school shooting taking place in the USA. A school shooting the place which should be reserved for education and knowledge yet we now have to go through drills and be taught what to do in case a shooter came to our school. Why should we be so worried about being killed when we go somewhere to learn and expand what we know? What is the government s response to this? They ve barely made any changes to gun control laws even after the March4OurLives protest and yearly killings. Instead the Trump Administration s suggestion was to arm teachers with guns themselves so that they could defend themselves in this case. This wouldn t save people from school shootings it would just make shootings more common and more people would end up dead. Instead of making the ability for anyone to buy a gun harder it becomes easier day by day. Hopefully in our next administration we may see a change for our benefit in gun control. Onto the subject on whether guns should be banned let s look at a few statistics. In 2018 74 of homicides were due to firearms. Let s just look at the fact of us banning guns if we were to although there may be illegal trade due to the banning just like there is with other banned objects the number of people with guns would be highly decreased and so would homicides. 74 of people killed in America could be saved if we ban guns because guns are one of the easiest to access easiest to use and easiest to mass murder with out of all weapons. The idea of banning guns has been raised several times before but people argue that our police won t be able to protect themselves or get others and neither will we be able to protect ourselves if there is an intruder. As well as that they bring up their right constituted in the second amendment that everyone should be allowed to keep arms. Banning guns altogether may be beneficial on the whole but people will feel much more vulnerable without protection and police officers won t be able to do their job properly. How can this be solved? With the use of non lethal weapons and guns. Two examples of this are an airsoft gun and a tranquilizer. If people were to use non lethal guns then they would be just as likely to get their target as they would with a normal gun making them better than knives and other weapons but they wouldn t kill people. Police could use these to knock out people and people can use it for their self defense saving them as well as guns but in the end the people aren t killed. This helps decrease almost all deaths by guns but still allows people to protect themself. Since the second amendment discusses people owning firearms for their safety this would be able to solve that problem and get rid of the majority of the mortality rate. While problems still arise with these technologies if we are able to develop a safe enough weapon that immediately knocks out an opponent it would be a great substitute for guns.

But over time gun control laws have placed limits on that freedom. Some politicians and gun control proponents argue that these laws are necessary even at the cost of infringing upon a fundamental American right. But the fact is gun control doesn t work the way advocates argue it does. Gun control is an umbrella term that refers to laws and ordinances that restrict how lawabiding citizens can buy own or use firearms. These vary at the federal state and local levels. This means that while the Second Amendment protects your Right to Keep and Bear Arms there may be different restrictions placed upon that right depending on where you live. Gun control at the local level ranges widely. For example in some towns citizens who are licensed to carry concealed firearms cannot do so in public parks. And in Chicago it s unlawful to own most semiautomatic firearms. Federal gun control legislation like the Gun Control Act of 1968and the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act 1993 created nationwide requirements that make it more difficult to obtain a firearm. These laws have been in place for decades and by now the evidence is crystal clear. Gun control doesn t work. Some of the key reasons are detailed below. Criminals Don t Obey Gun Control Laws Criminals by definition do not obey the law. Gun control laws only affect lawabiding people who go through legal avenues to obtain firearms. Criminals overwhelmingly obtain their firearms through illegal channels and will never be deterred by state and federal laws. That s why background checks have virtually no impact on criminals. A 2016 Obama administration study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics examined how prison inmates obtained the firearms they used during crimes and the results weren t surprising. The study found that only about 10.1 obtained their firearms through a retail source.  The vast majority of criminals obtained their firearms through other means including 1 Criminals who go through illegal avenues to obtain firearms arent going to submit to background checks while doing so. Ultimately only lawabiding citizens would be impacted by expanded background checks. Background Checks Aren t Effective Even if criminals did submit to background checks we ve seen that these checks aren t effective at stopping those who intend to use guns to commit crimes. A person with no criminal history walks into a store to buy a gun they ll use to commit a crime. A background check most likely won t stop them. A drug addict lies about their addiction on a federal background check form. Although this individual is committing a federal crime a background check most likely won t stop them. A person with serious mental health issues but no history of treatment or institutionalization goes to buy a gun. A background check most likely won t stop them. It makes sense then that background checks have no impact on violent crime. Just take a look at California a state that s had background checks in place for decades. In 2018 a study was released that examined the effect of comprehensive background checks on the state. The study examined nearly two decades 19812000 of data and found that background checks had no effect on homicide rates in California. 2 Again and again firearm background checks have proven to be ineffective. What we do know is that they simply make the gun buying process more difficult for lawabiding citizens.  On the other hand allowing lawabiding citizens to more easily access firearms does help reduce violent crime. Gun control advocates have long promoted the idea that making firearms more accessible would increase crime. But time has told a different story. Gun ownership is up and violent crime is down overall. Let s look over some quick facts It makes sense that criminals would be far less likely to commit a crime if they believed their victim might be armed. In fact a major study of 2000 felons in state and federal prisons across the United States showed that criminals actually fear armed citizens more than they fear the police. 8  Cities with the Strictest Gun Control Have the Highest Crime Rates Does gun control reduce crime? The evidence says no.  In fact cities with some of the most stringent gun laws like New York and Chicago suffer from some of the highest violent crime rates. Shooting and murder rates in Chicago surged 50 in 2020 and that city recorded the highest number of gunrelated homicides on record. 9 Guncontrolled Chicago became the most murderous city in the country.  New York City saw similarly alarming statistics. In 2020 homicides increased 41 and shootings increased an astounding 95. 10 Studies have shown that homicide rates tend to rise when lawabiding citizens are unable to own and carry firearms for selfdefense. 11 And the recent statistics from some of the country s most antigun cities confirm this conclusion. The simplest solution is crime control enforcing existing laws aimed at criminals who carry and use firearms to commit their crimes. We know that homicides in cities trend down when elected officials encourage solid police work and harsh penalties for gun criminals. We ve seen it work in past years in Chicago when the city gave additional resources to law enforcement. We ve known for decades that crime control works. A good example is Project Exile a program launched in Richmond Virginia in 1997. Faced with a skyhigh homicide rate Richmond prosecutors began enforcing existing gun laws to the fullest imposing lengthy sentences against drug dealers and other criminals who were carrying firearms illegally.  The project was an enormous success. Law enforcement took hundreds of illegal guns off the street and Richmonds homicide rate plummeted. 12 Other cities implemented the program with similar success.  In short Project Exile demonstrated beyond a doubt that focusing on gun criminals not placing undue burden on lawabiding citizens is the best way to curb violent crime and make the American people safe.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/513623/majority-continues-favor-stricter-gun-laws.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Gallup s latest update on Americans opinions on gun laws finds a majority continuing to favor strengthening those laws. Fiftysix percent of U.S. adults say gun laws should be stricter while 31 believe they should be kept as they are now and 12 favor less strict gun laws. These attitudes collected before last week s mass shooting in Lewiston Maine are unchanged from a year ago but they reflect less support for stricter laws than in June 2022 66 after the Uvalde Texas school shooting. Majorities have consistently favored stricter gun laws since 2015 with notable spikes in that view after prominent shootings such as in Uvalde and Parkland Florida in 2018. Gallup first asked Americans about their preferences for gun laws using the current wording in 1990. Since then majorities have typically called for stricter laws including a high of 78 in the initial September 1990 measurement amid heightened concern about crime and ongoing congressional debate over the Brady Bill handgun legislation which ultimately passed in 1993. The exceptions to majoritylevel support for stricter laws occurred between 2008 and 2014 when between 43 and 49 favored tougher laws with that trend temporarily interrupted by a December 2012 58 reading conducted shortly after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The pattern of increased support for stricter gun laws after prominent shootings suggests that a higher proportion than the 56 measured in the Oct. 223 poll would favor tougher laws if measured today in the wake of the Oct. 25 Lewiston shootings. An Army reservist killed 18 people in shootings at two locations in the Maine town. While Americans do want gun laws tightened they also do not favor a ban on handguns for ordinary citizens something Gallup has asked about since 1959. Just 27 of U.S. adults believe that no one outside of police or other authorized persons should be able to possess a handgun. The current figure is on the lower end of what Gallup has measured historically including 60 who favored a ban in 1959 and roughly four in 10 Americans in most surveys conducted between 1975 and 1993. The low point of 19 favoring a ban came in an October 2021 survey. Opposition to a handgun ban is consistent with Americans belief that having guns makes people s homes safer rather than more dangerous. Currently 64 believe guns make homes safer while 32 believe they make them more dangerous. Public opinion on this issue has shifted over time. When Gallup first asked this version of the question in 2000 a slim majority of 51 believed guns made homes more dangerous places to live. Americans views were evenly divided in 2004 and 2006 but by 2014 the majority had come to believe that guns made homes safer. Opinions have held steady since then. As might be expected the overwhelming majority of those with a gun in their household 86 believe guns make homes safer just 12 disagree. Among those living in households without guns opinion is divided 45 believe they are safer and 49 more dangerous places to live with guns present. Democrats overwhelmingly believe gun laws should be made stricter and believe guns make homes more dangerous. They are also much more likely than Republicans to favor a handgun ban. In contrast Republicans generally want gun laws kept as they are now and believe guns make homes safer. Independents side with Democrats on wanting stricter gun laws but they are closer to Republicans in believing guns increase home safety rather than decrease it. Today s partisan differences on guns contrast with relatively modest gaps two decades ago. Fortyfour percent of U.S. adults say they have a gun in their home or on their property with 30 saying the gun belongs to them personally and the remainder saying it belongs to another household member. These percentages are steady compared with recent years although Gallup measured higher rates of household gun possession between 50 and 53 in the early 1990s. Gun ownership rates have increased among Republicans over the past two decades 45 of Republicans say they personally own a gun and 58 live in a gun household. In 2000 the figures were 32 and 48 respectively. Among independents ownership rates are similar to what they were in 2000 with 29 personally owning a gun and 43 living in a gun household. Democratic gun ownership has declined slightly. Now 18 of Democrats say they personally own a gun and 29 live in a gun household compared with 23 and 36 respectively in 2000. The new poll confirms prior years finding that U.S. gun owners typically have more than one gun. Currently 29 of Americans who have a gun in their household report having one gun while 33 say they have between two and four guns and 22 have five or more. Sixteen percent of respondents from gun households would not disclose how many guns they own. On seven other occasions since 1993 Gallup has asked those with guns to say how many guns their household owns. In each of those surveys majorities of 59 or greater have said their household had multiple guns. But gun owners may now be owning more total guns than in the past. U.S. adults with a gun in their household say their house has an average of 4.9 guns. In prior surveys the average number of guns owned ranged between 4.0 and 4.5. However because of smaller sample sizes of gun owners in each survey and a large variation in the reported number of guns the current estimate is not significantly higher than past measures from a statistical perspective. The gun issue has played a major role in U.S. political debate in recent years and each mass shooting such as the one that occurred in Maine last week returns the issue to the forefront. Though the two major U.S. political parties are increasingly divided on the issue Americans as a whole have been largely consistent in wanting gun laws to be stricter but also opposing a handgun ban. Their views on whether guns make homes safer or more dangerous have shifted with a solid majority now believing guns make homes safer. Last year in response to the Uvalde shooting Congress passed and President Joe Biden signed into law bipartisan legislation designed to address gun violence which was hailed as the first major federal legislation on the issue in decades. The legislation expanded background checks on gun purchases for young adults increased mental health funding expanded prohibitions on gun ownership for people convicted of domestic violence and created incentives for states to pass red flag laws. However Americans apparently did not see those steps as going far enough to prevent gun violence with no decrease since the law was signed in the percentage wanting laws to be tougher. That could reflect that Americans favor a number of proposals that have been offered as antidotes to gun violence including longer waiting periods for gun purchases and an assault weapons ban that were not included in the legislation.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/09/13/key-facts-about-americans-and-guns/, The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to bear arms and about a third of U.S. adults say they personally own a gun. At the same time in response to concerns such as rising gun death rates and mass shootings President Joe Biden has proposed gun policy legislation that would expand on the bipartisan gun safety bill Congress passed last year. Here are some key findings about Americans views of gun ownership gun policy and other subjects drawn primarily from a Pew Research Center survey conducted in June 2023. Pew Research Center conducted this analysis to summarize key facts about Americans and guns. We used data from recent Center surveys to provide insights into Americans views on gun policy and how those views have changed over time as well as to examine the proportion of adults who own guns and their reasons for doing so. The analysis draws primarily from a survey of 5115 U.S. adults conducted from June 5 to June 11 2023. Everyone who took part in the surveys cited is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for the analysis on gun ownership the questions used for the analysis on gun policy and the survey s methodology. Additional information about the fall 2022 survey of parents and its methodology can be found at the link in the text of this post. Measuring gun ownership in the United States comes with unique challenges. Unlike many demographic measures there is not a definitive data source from the government or elsewhere on how many American adults own guns. The Pew Research Center survey conducted June 511 2023 on the Center s American Trends Panel asks about gun ownership using two separate questions to measure personal and household ownership. About a third of adults 32 say they own a gun while another 10 say they do not personally own a gun but someone else in their household does. These shares have changed little from surveys conducted in 2021 and 2017. In each of those surveys 30 reported they owned a gun. These numbers are largely consistent with rates of gun ownership reported by Gallup but somewhat higher than those reported by NORC s General Social Survey. Those surveys also find only modest changes in recent years. The FBI maintains data on background checks on individuals attempting to purchase firearms in the United States. The FBI reported a surge in background checks in 2020 and 2021 during the coronavirus pandemic. The number of federal background checks declined in 2022 and through the first half of this year according to FBI statistics. About fourinten U.S. adults say they live in a household with a gun including 32 who say they personally own one according to an August report based on our June survey. These numbers are virtually unchanged since the last time we asked this question in 2021. There are differences in gun ownership rates by political affiliation gender community type and other factors. Personal protection tops the list of reasons gun owners give for owning a firearm. About threequarters 72 of gun owners say that protection is a major reason they own a gun. Considerably smaller shares say that a major reason they own a gun is for hunting 32 for sport shooting 30 as part of a gun collection 15 or for their job 7.  The reasons behind gun ownership have changed only modestly since our 2017 survey of attitudes toward gun ownership and gun policies. At that time 67 of gun owners cited protection as a major reason they owned a firearm. Gun owners tend to have much more positive feelings about having a gun in the house than nonowners who live with them. For instance 71 of gun owners say they enjoy owning a gun but far fewer nongun owners in gunowning households 31 say they enjoy having one in the home. And while 81 of gun owners say owning a gun makes them feel safer a narrower majority 57 of nonowners in gun households say the same about having a firearm at home. Nonowners are also more likely than owners to worry about having a gun in the home 27 vs. 12 respectively. Feelings about gun ownership also differ by political affiliation even among those who personally own firearms. Republican gun owners are more likely than Democratic owners to say owning a gun gives them feelings of safety and enjoyment while Democratic owners are more likely to say they worry about having a gun in the home. Nongun owners are split on whether they see themselves owning a firearm in the future. About half 52 of Americans who don t own a gun say they could never see themselves owning one while nearly as many 47 could imagine themselves as gun owners in the future. Americans are evenly split over whether gun ownership does more to increase or decrease safety. About half 49 say it does more to increase safety by allowing lawabiding citizens to protect themselves but an equal share say gun ownership does more to reduce safety by giving too many people access to firearms and increasing misuse. Republicans and Democrats differ on this question 79 of Republicans say that gun ownership does more to increase safety while a nearly identical share of Democrats 78 say that it does more to reduce safety. Urban and rural Americans also have starkly different views. Among adults who live in urban areas 64 say gun ownership reduces safety while 34 say it does more to increase safety. Among those who live in rural areas 65 say gun ownership increases safety compared with 33 who say it does more to reduce safety. Those living in the suburbs are about evenly split. Americans increasingly say that gun violence is a major problem. Sixinten U.S. adults say gun violence is a very big problem in the country today up 9 percentage points from spring 2022. In the survey conducted this June 23 say gun violence is a moderately big problem and about twointen say it is either a small problem 13 or not a problem at all 4. Looking ahead 62 of Americans say they expect the level of gun violence to increase over the next five years. This is double the share who expect it to stay the same 31. Just 7 expect the level of gun violence to decrease. A majority of Americans 61 say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun in this country. Another 30 say the ease of legally obtaining a gun is about right and 9 say it is too hard to get a gun. Nongun owners are nearly twice as likely as gun owners to say it is too easy to legally obtain a gun 73 vs. 38. Meanwhile gun owners are more than twice as likely as nonowners to say the ease of obtaining a gun is about right 48 vs. 20. Partisan and demographic differences also exist on this question. While 86 of Democrats say it is too easy to obtain a gun legally 34 of Republicans say the same. Most urban 72 and suburban 63 dwellers say it s too easy to legally obtain a gun. Rural residents are more divided 47 say it is too easy 41 say it is about right and 11 say it is too hard. About sixinten U.S. adults 58 favor stricter gun laws. Another 26 say that U.S. gun laws are about right and 15 favor less strict gun laws. The percentage who say these laws should be stricter has fluctuated a bit in recent years. In 2021 53 favored stricter gun laws and in 2019 60 said laws should be stricter. About a third 32 of parents with K12 students say they are very or extremely worried about a shooting ever happening at their children s school according to a fall 2022 Center survey of parents with at least one child younger than 18. A similar share of K12 parents 31 say they are not too or not at all worried about a shooting ever happening at their children s school while 37 of parents say they are somewhat worried. Among all parents with children under 18 including those who are not in school 63 see improving mental health screening and treatment as a very or extremely effective way to prevent school shootings. This is larger than the shares who say the same about having police officers or armed security in schools 49 banning assaultstyle weapons 45 or having metal detectors in schools 41. Just 24 of parents say allowing teachers and school administrators to carry guns in school would be a very or extremely effective approach while half say this would be not too or not at all effective. There is broad partisan agreement on some gun policy proposals but most are politically divisive the June 2023 survey found. Majorities of U.S. adults in both partisan coalitions somewhat or strongly favor two policies that would restrict gun access preventing those with mental illnesses from purchasing guns 88 of Republicans and 89 of Democrats support this and increasing the minimum age for buying guns to 21 years old 69 of Republicans 90 of Democrats. Majorities in both parties also oppose allowing people to carry concealed firearms without a permit 60 of Republicans and 91 of Democrats oppose this. Republicans and Democrats differ on several other proposals. While 85 of Democrats favor banning both assaultstyle weapons and highcapacity ammunition magazines that hold more than 10 rounds majorities of Republicans oppose these proposals 57 and 54 respectively. Most Republicans on the other hand support allowing teachers and school officials to carry guns in K12 schools 74 and allowing people to carry concealed guns in more places 71. These proposals are supported by just 27 and 19 of Democrats respectively. Gun ownership is linked with views on gun policies. Americans who own guns are less likely than nonowners to favor restrictions on gun ownership with a notable exception. Nearly identical majorities of gun owners 87 and nonowners 89 favor preventing mentally ill people from buying guns. Within both parties differences between gun owners and nonowners are evident but they are especially stark among Republicans. For example majorities of Republicans who do not own guns support banning highcapacity ammunition magazines and assaultstyle weapons compared with about threeinten Republican gun owners. Among Democrats majorities of both gun owners and nonowners favor these two proposals though support is greater among nonowners.  Note This is an update of a post originally published on Jan. 5 2016.
