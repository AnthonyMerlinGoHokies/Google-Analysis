Health Secretary Vaughan Gething has today marked the 10th anniversary of free prescriptions being available in Wales. This was published under the 2016 to 2021 administration of the Welsh Government Since 1 April 2007 prescription medicine has been provided free in Wales. All patients registered with a Welsh GP who get their prescriptions from a pharmacist in Wales are eligible.The GP is one of a number of frontline clinical experts able to prescribe medication. Others include pharmacists and nurses prescriptions issued by these are also free of charge. The decision to abolish prescription charges was taken in light of evidence that some people with serious chronic conditions such as high blood pressure or heart disease could not afford their prescriptions and chose to have only part of the prescription dispensed to reduce the cost. Health Secretary Vaughan Gething said  Free prescriptions were introduced in Wales in 2007 as a longterm investment to improve people s health.   We were the first of the home nations to take the step to introduce free prescriptions and I m delighted that both Scotland and Northern Ireland followed our lead.  We firmly believe by providing people with the medication they need helps to keep them well and out of hospital thereby reducing the overall cost to the NHS. It should never be the case that people with serious chronic conditions can not afford to collect their prescription.  Ensuring patients have the medication they need not only improves their own health and wellbeing it also benefits the health service as a whole by reducing hospital attendance and placing fewer demands on general practitioners.   It is socially irresponsible to charge people with serious chronic conditions for the medication they need. Free prescriptions are progressive and an integral part of our health services in Wales.

The independent source for health policy research polling and news. Ashley Kirzinger Alex Montero Grace Sparks Isabelle Valdes and Liz HamelPublished Aug 21 2023 This chart collection was updated on Aug. 21 2023 to include the latest KFF polling data. An additional update was made to figure 1 on Aug. 29 2023 to correctly show July 2023 data.KFF research has consistently found prescription drug costs to be an important health policy area of public interest and public concern. Below are some key findings on the public s experience with and perceptions of prescription drugs and their prices. About six in ten adults say they are currently taking at least one prescription drug and a quarter say they currently take four or more prescription medications. While about eight in ten adults 82 say the cost of prescription drugs is unreasonable most say affording prescriptions is either very or somewhat easy 65. Affordability is a bigger issue for those who are currently taking four or more prescription medicines. Nearly four in ten of those taking four or more prescription drugs say they have difficulty affording their prescriptions 37 compared to one in five adults who currently take three or fewer prescription medications 18. Individuals with annual household income of less than 40000 are also more likely than adults with higher incomes to report difficulty affording their prescription medications. About three in ten adults report not taking their medicines as prescribed at some point in the past year because of the cost. This includes about one in five who report they have not filled a prescription or took an overthe counter drug instead 21 and 12 who say they have cut pills in half or skipped a dose because of the cost. The share who report not filling a prescription taking an overthecounter drug instead or cutting pills in half or skipping doses increases to four in ten among adult ages 1829 40 Hispanic adults 39 those taking four or more prescription drugs 37 and those living in households with an annual income of less than 40000 annually 37. The public sees profits made by pharmaceutical companies as the largest factor contributing to the price of prescription drugs. At least eight in ten across partisans say profits made by pharmaceutical companies are a major factor in the price of prescription drugs. This is followed by more than half who say the cost of research and development is a major factor contributing to the price and about half saying that the cost of marketing and advertising is a major contributing factor to the cost of prescription drugs. The July 2023 KFF Tracking Poll finds three in four adults saying there is not as much regulation as there should be when it comes to limiting the price of prescription drugs. Majorities across partisans including eight in ten Democrats 82 and about twothirds of Republicans 68 and independents 67 say there is not as much regulation as there should be when it comes to limiting the price of prescription drugs. KFF polling also finds that when it comes to lowering the cost of prescription drugs majorities of partisans trust their own party to do a better job on this issue. Independents are more likely to trust the Democratic Party than the Republican Party to do a better job of lowering the price of prescription drugs. Despite this neither party in Congress has gained the full confidence of the public to do what s right for the country on prescription drug pricing. Slightly less than half of the public say they have a great deal or a fair amount of confidence in President Biden 46 or Democrats in Congress 48 to recommend the right thing for the country on prescription drug prices. Onethird of the public 33 say they have at least a fair amount of confidence in Republicans in Congress and few are confident that pharmaceutical companies will recommend the right thing 14. Half of adults are confident in AARP s ability to recommend the right thing for the country on prescription drug pricing. AARP is a nonpartisan interest group focusing on the issues that impact adults over the age of 50 that has strongly advocated for Medicare drug negotiations. KFF has been asking about various proposals aimed at lowering the cost of prescription drugs for decades. Majorities across partisans support a wide range of proposals including most notably allowing the federal government to negotiate with drug companies to get a lower price on medications. Majorities also favor increasing taxes on drug companies that refuse to negotiate the price of their drugs with the government limiting how much drug companies can increase the price of drugs based on annual inflation rates allowing Americans to buy drugs imported from Canada and making it easier for generic drugs to come to market. Support for these policies does range slightly among partisans and after hearing arguments in favor or against each proposal. The Inflation Reduction Act IRA passed in 2022 includes several provisions aimed at lowering prescription drug costs for adults in Medicare. At least eight in ten adults support each of the law s provisions related to Medicare prescription drug costs including majorities across partisans. While large majorities of adults say they support the IRA s Medicare provisions few are aware that these provisions are currently law. Adults ages 65 and older are more likely than younger adults to be aware of some of the IRA s Medicare provisions however a majority are still unaware that these provisions are currently in place. While the public still has concerns about costs and supports policies aimed at curbing prescription drug prices the public generally sees the benefits of prescription medicines as more than six in ten adults believe prescription drugs developed over the past 20 years have generally made the lives of people in the U.S. better.

https://www.parkinsons.org.uk/news/prescription-charges-are-barrier-keeping-people-well-and-work-survey-reveals, A survey of over 4000 people with longterm conditions including those with Parkinson s on prescription charges has found the charge is a barrier to accessing medicine. The findings come following the UK governments announcement that the prescription charge will rise on 1 April 2023. The Prescription Charges Coalition which brings together around 50 organisations and professional bodies to campaign to scrap prescription charges in England for people with longterm conditions conducted the survey between February and March. The survey shows that people with longterm health conditions that cannot afford their medication are seeing an increase in GP visits trips to accident and emergency A E and hospital stays. Some survey respondents reported they had to stay in hospital for up to 6 weeks. Not being able to afford medicine has also led to mental health issues and increased time off work.  Read the full prescription charges report PDF 282KB. Some serious conditions such as asthma multiple sclerosis Crohn s and Colitis motor neurone disease cystic fibrosis stroke and Parkinsons are still not included on the exemptions list despite the need for medication to stay well and in many cases alive.  England is the only UK country where people have to pay for their medicines.  The Coalition argues that if patients skip their medication it leads to further health problems which cost the NHS significantly more.  It has condemned the decision to raise the cost of prescription charges sharing that the rise will result in sick people relying more on NHS services that are already at breaking point. Laura Cockram Chair of the Prescription Charges Coalition and Head of Policy and Campaigns for Parkinson s UK said  We are deeply concerned about these findings which is a clear message that the prescription charge exemption system needs urgent reform.  It is not meeting the needs of people with longterm conditions and is putting their health at risk which we fear will intensify as the charges increase on 1 April. The charges for people with longterm health conditions fail those who are being forced to make tough choices every day about whether they feed their families pay their bills or take their medication. As we have seen from our survey medication could keep them out of hospital. We know the price rise will result in sick people relying more on NHS services that are already at breaking point. Far from this government s aim of improving life expectancy for people with stroke dementia asthma and mental ill health this increase in the prescription charge will create a health emergency for people with these conditions and other longterm conditions in England.  The UK government must urgently commit to reviewing the prescription charges exemption list or it will fail in its bid to create a healthier nation.

https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/millions-skip-medications-due-to-their-high-cost-201501307673, When and how should you be screened for colon cancer? Coregulation Helping children and teens navigate big emotions Medications can do wonderful things from fighting infection to preventing stroke and warding off depression. But medications don t work if they aren t taken. Some people don t take their medications as prescribed because they forget or are bothered by side effects. A report from the National Center for Health Statistics shines the light on another reason some people can t pay for their medications. The survey by NCHS researchers Robin A. Cohen and Maria A. Villarroel found that about 8 of adult Americans don t take their medicines as prescribed because they can t afford them. Insurance coverage often influenced this moneysaving strategy. Among younger adults those under age 65 6 who had private insurance skipped medicines to save money compared to 10 for those with Medicaid and 14 of those with no insurance. Among the poorest adults those with incomes well below the federal poverty level nearly 14 did not take medications as prescribed to save money. Other strategies that those surveyed said they used to save money on drug costs included asking doctors for lowercost medications buying prescription drugs from other countries and using alternative therapies. Given the range of health conditions that many adults face from high cholesterol and high blood pressure to arthritis diabetes and more it s not unusual for some people to take five or more different prescription drugs per day. Some people I admit to the hospital have 10 or more different medications listed on their medical records. Even if they could afford them managing that many different medicines is a challenge and is often impossible. Not taking medications as prescribed can cause serious problems. It can lead to unnecessary complications related to a medical condition. It can lead to a bad outcome like a heart attack or stroke. It can also increase medical costs if hospitalization or other medical interventions are needed. With the high price of most prescription drugs it s not surprising that many Americans choose not to fill a prescription or take it as directed to save money. Even with health insurance that includes a prescription drug benefit the copayments alone can be a prohibitive. New medications continue to be approved yearly few are taken off the market. The price of new drugs is always high and prices don t always fall when drugs become available as generics. If you are having difficulty affording your medications here are some questions to ask your doctor Which medicines are the most essential for me? If your medications have been prescribed by different doctors ask one of them preferably your primary care physician which ones are really necessary. Get an explanation of how each drug improves your quality of life keeps you out of the hospital andor helps you live longer. Which medicines might I be able to stop with minimal risk to my health? There aren t always easy answers to this question. You may need to do your own research to make a shared decision with your doctor. Are there lifestyle changes I can make now that might let me stop some of my medications? For conditions such as high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes lifestyle changes such as exercising more and following a healthier diet can often decrease the number and dose of drugs you take.

Background Prescription charges or copayments have been shown to reduce consumption of medicines. For people living in poverty prescription charges can prevent them from getting the medicines they need and this can result in poorer health status. Prescription charges are low in New Zealand compared to many other countries but those living in poverty are not exempt from fees.   Objectives The aim of this study was to explore the lived experience of people who struggle to pay prescription charges and to propose a model for how being unable to afford prescription charges might affect health.   Methods Participants were recruited through organizations that provide services entirely or predominantly to low income persons. Semistructured interviews were carried out with 29 people who had been identified as having problems paying for prescriptions. Approximately half of the sample population was M ori indigenous New Zealanders. Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Otago.   Results Participants reported having to make difficult decisions when picking up their prescription medicines. These included choosing some medicines and leaving others such as choosing medicines for mental health rather than physical health cutting food consumption or eating less healthy food so as to pay for medicines or picking up medicines for children while leaving those for adults. Participants also reported strategies like reducing doses to make prescriptions last longer and delaying picking up medicines. These led to suboptimal dosing or interrupted treatment.   Conclusions Even low financial barriers can have a significant impact on low income peoples access to medicines and reduce the effectiveness of treatment. Not being able to afford prescription medicines may impact negatively on peoples health directly by preventing access to medicines through reducing expenditure on other items need for health and by potentiating stigma.

https://healthprize.com/blog/should-we-give-away-medications-for-free/, HEALTHPRIZE BLOG The solution may not be a practical one but if we gave away medication for free everyone would become a perfect patient and never miss a dose or refill right? Unfortunately the solution to medication nonadherence isn t that simple. Research and expert investigation reveal that even free access to prescriptions would barely make a dent in the problem. Nonadherence s root causes go well beyond the cost of medication and deep into human psychology.  Nonadherence is a huge problem and there s no one solution because there are many different reasons why it happens says Bruce Bender codirector of the Center for Health Promotion at National Jewish Health in Denver. Taking pills can become a daily reminder of an illness and make patients feel weak and vulnerable. It can also be difficult to connect today s dose of preventative medication to a possible future health problem particularly in the case of silent conditions like hypertension.  I m oldfashioned I don t take medication for nothing one patient with failing kidneys peripheral vascular disease diabetes and a large clot in his heart told Dr. Lisa Rosenbaum This kind of thinking is often to blame when patients end their prescription regimen against medical advice. A TruvenHealth and NPR study found that of the people who stopped taking a prescribed medication without telling their provider 14.5 did so because they believed the medication wasn t working and 15.8 stopped because they felt better. Over 17 of patients ended their refills because they believed they no longer needed the medication which Bruce Bender says is common. He reports that patients often do a test stopping their medications for a few weeks and if they don t feel any different they stay off them. While they may not notice an immediate impact nonadherent patients will have to deal with the negative repercussions of this choice in the future. Interestingly only 10.3 of the patients surveyed reported cost as the reason they stopped taking their prescription. Paul Slovic has shown that if we feel negatively disposed toward something information we receive about its potential risks leads us to discount its potential benefits. For patients already uncertain about prescriptions this can lead to overemphasizing side effects and ignoring nonadherence s impact on long term health. The TruvenHealthNPR study seems to bear this out. Twentynine percent of patients who stopped taking their prescription medication without telling their provider did so due to side effects the highest single factor reported. When we look at results only for respondents earning less than 25000 per year that number skyrockets to 51.9. In this same group which would theoretically be most sensitive to the price of prescriptions only 12.1 of patients cited cost as the main reason they gave up a prescription. Dr. Katrina Firlik cofounder and Chief Medical Officer of HealthPrize prescribes a more robust approach to the nonadherence problem one that incorporates education psychology gamification and behavioral economics to deal simultaneously with multiple causes.  We have to be more creative she says. We re dealing with the human brain.
