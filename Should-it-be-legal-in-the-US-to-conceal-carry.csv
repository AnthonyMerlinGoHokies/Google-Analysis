Guns carried in public pose a danger to public safety and lax concealed carry laws increase the risk of violent confrontations.  The carrying of concealed loaded guns in public places can quickly escalate everyday conflicts into deadly altercations causing tragic irreversible damage to innocent lives. These dangers are amplified when states weaken their standards for who is qualified to carry loaded weapons in public or when states eliminate these standards and protections entirely. John J. Donohue Abhay Aneja and Kyle D. Weber Right to Carry Laws and Violent Crime A Comprehensive Assessment Using Panel Data and a State Level Synthetic Control Analysis Journal of Empirical Legal Studies 16 no. 2 2019 198 247. Historically almost every state prohibited or strictly limited the carrying of concealed loaded weapons in public places. These restrictions were among the earliest gun laws adopted in the United States. In the late 20th century some states began to grant law enforcement discretion to issue permits often called CCW or carrying a concealed weapon permits to people who passed a background check and received firearm safety training andor demonstrated a particular need to carry hidden loaded guns in public. At the behest of the gun lobby however many states have in recent years substantially weakened standards for qualifying for these permits and 26 states have now eliminated these protections entirely. These changes have enormously expanded the number of people who are authorized to carry hidden loaded handguns in public streets crowds and spaces and also often significantly increased the number of public locations in which the public may carry firearms including public parks and schools college campuses hospitals government buildings bars and many others. Many people may be surprised to learn just how lax many states standards are. In 2020 a member of the US Commission on Civil rights expressed alarm that weak public carry laws like the state of Florida s still allowed the man who murdered Trayvon Martin to possess and carry loaded concealed firearms in public despite his history of domestic violence and assaulting a police officer killing Trayvon Martin and then subsequently being convicted of criminally stalking someone else.4 Of the 26 states that now authorize people to carry concealed handguns in public without a permit or background check required all but one also allow people to purchase handguns without a background check too meaning that the residents of 25 states are generally able to purchase and carry concealed weapons designed to take human life in most public spaces without ever passing any background check whatsoever or ever receiving any safety training or information about safe and responsible handling of firearms. Guns carried in public pose a substantial threat to public safety. A robust body of academic literature shows that when more people carry guns in public violent crime increases.  Studies found that certain aspects of the permitting process have been beneficial including livefire training and prohibitions preventing people with a history of misdemeanor violence from carrying in public. In fact states that ended livefire training requirements when adopting permitless carry laws saw a 32 increase in gun assaults.8 There is also some evidence that lax concealed carry laws increase other undesirable outcomes including police shootings of civilians gun thefts and unintentional gun injuries.  In addition to the robust evidence showing the dangers of permissive public carry laws there is no research that suggests expanding public carry has any public safety benefits.  In recent years the gun lobby has been pushing federal legislation that would mandate that each state recognize concealed carry permits from every other state. So far such efforts have been unsuccessful. Many states have extremely lax permitting laws many states do not even require a permit to carry concealed. Forcing states with strong CCW laws like California and New York to comply with weak laws from states like Florida and Louisiana will endanger public safety and make it significantly harder for police to enforce gun laws proven to save lives. We re in this together. To build a safer America one where children and parents in every neighborhood can learn play work and worship without fear of gun violence we need you standing beside us in this fight. Federal law provides that certain law enforcement officers may carry concealed firearms. Any qualified law enforcement officer with proper agencyissued identification may carry a concealed firearm.14 Qualified retired law enforcement officer with proper identification may also carry a concealed firearm.15 Both statutes supersede state and local laws regarding concealed carry by law enforcement except in certain circumstances. States are not precluded from allowing private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property by current or retired law enforcement. States also are not precluded from prohibiting or restricting the possession of firearms by current or retired law enforcement on any state or local government property installations buildings bases or parks. Significantly a person holding a stateissued permit allowing the person to acquire or possess firearms e.g. a concealed weapons permit is not required to undergo a background check if the permit was issued 1 within the previous five years in the state in which the transfer is to take place and 2 after an authorized government official has conducted a background investigation to verify that possession of a firearm would not be unlawful.16 Permits issued after November 30 1998 qualify as exempt only if the approval process included a NICS check.17 This exemption threatens public safety because it allows a prohibited person to acquire a firearm when the person falls into a prohibited category after issuance of the state permit and the state has not immediately revoked the permit. Under the federal exemption no background check is required and the seller would have no way to learn that the prospective purchaser is prohibited from possessing firearms. For more information about this exemption see our summary on Background Check Procedures. Every state as well as the District of Columbia authorizes people to carry concealed weapons in public in some form. Twentyone states generally require a stateissued permit in order to carry concealed weapons in public CCW permit.18 However the remaining 29 Alabama Alaska Arizona Arkansas Florida Georgia Idaho Indiana Iowa Kansas Kentucky Louisiana Maine Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska New Hampshire North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Utah Vermont West Virginia and Wyoming now generally allow people to carry concealed weapons in most public spaces without any permit background check or safety training at all. However 28 of these 29 states still issue CCW permits individuals may desire them to qualify for an exemption from federal law s background check requirements when purchasing a firearm or so that they may carry concealed weapons in other states or additional locations. Of the 29 states that do not require a permit or background check to carry a loaded concealed weapon in public only two of them Nebraska and Vermont require a background check to purchase some or all firearms. In other words in 27 states a person may purchase and carry a firearm in public without any background check. See Universal Background Checks for more information.  Michael Siegel et al. Easiness of Legal Access to Concealed Firearm Permits and Homicide Rates in the United States American Journal of Public Health 107 no. 12 2017 1923 1929. Ten states and the District of Columbia require applicants to establish that they are suitable persons to carry a concealed weapon before being issued a permit. Some states call this a good moral character requirement. For example Connecticut will not issue permits to individuals whose conduct has shown them to be lacking the essential character of temperament necessary to be entrusted with a weapon. 70 New Jersey requires that three reputable persons who have known the applicant for at least three years certify that the applicant is of good moral character and behavior. Delaware also requires that the applicant include with his or her application a certificate signed by five respectable citizens of the county in which the applicant resides stating that the applicant is of good moral character has a reputation for peace and good order and that possession of a concealed deadly weapon by the applicant is necessary for the protection of the applicant or the applicant s property. Indiana requires that the applicant be of good character and reputation. Rhode Island requires a person to either have a suitable character or make a proper showing of need.  Some states that do not have an affirmative suitable person application requirement still allow a CCW application to be denied to a person who is not categorically ineligible if law enforcement can show a documented reason to believe the person is dangerous. Gun violence is a complex problem and while there s no onesizefitsall solution we must act. Our reports bring you the latest cuttingedge research and analysis about strategies to end our country s gun violence crisis at every level. More than half of the states and the District of Columbia require a CCW permit applicant to demonstrate that they have received training in firearm use andor safety. 71 For example California Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey New York and the District of Columbia require applicants to complete a firearm safety course or otherwise demonstrate their qualification to use a firearm safely. Delaware s firearm safety training requirement which applies to the applicant s initial CCW license only is particularly strong and specifies that the training course must include instruction regarding Delaware also requires that the training include live fireshooting exercises on a range including the expenditure of a minimum of 100 rounds of ammunition and identification of ways to develop and maintain firearmshooting skills. Finally Rhode Island requires applicants to obtain a certification that they are qualified to use a handgun of a caliber equal to or larger than the one they seek to carry. The certification can be obtained by passing a firing test conducted by a range officer or pistol instructor. Such thorough training requirements help ensure that only highly trained individuals are allowed to carry concealed firearms in public areas. Almost every state imposes at least some restrictions on the locations in which concealed weapons may be carried. For more information see our page on Location Restrictions. State concealed weapons permits vary in duration and renewal processes. The strongest laws limit the duration of permits and require applicants for renewal of a permit to undergo a complete background check and complete safety training and testing. Strong state laws also require the immediate revocation of a permit if the permitholder becomes ineligible for the permit or violates a law regarding firearms. State laws also vary regarding the carrying of concealed weapons by individuals who have obtained a permit from a different state. The strongest state laws limit the carrying of concealed weapons to individuals who have obtained a permit from that state. Other states limit carrying to individuals with permits from states that have similar requirements for their permits. The states with the weakest laws allow carrying by individuals with permits from any state that recognizes that state s permit or by individuals with permits from any state. The features listed below are intended to provide a framework from which policy options may be considered. A jurisdiction considering new legislation should consult with counsel.  As more laws are weakened to allow the carrying of openly visible firearms in public the threat of violence to the public rises alarmingly.   Universal background checks are essential to close deadly loopholes in our laws that allow millions of guns to end up in the hands of individuals at an elevated risk of committing violence each year.   States that allow firearms in sensitive or dangerous places are needlessly endangering the lives of their residents.   2024Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. All Rights Reserved.

https://www.billtrack50.com/blog/firearm-permits/, The Second Amendment of our Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear arms and many within the United States choose to do so by carrying a concealed firearm with them. Concealed carry is a practice taken part in by a multitude of Americans often as a means for selfdefense. Many Americans are opposed to concealed carry out of concern for gun violence prevention while proponents of the practice argue that it actually keeps individuals safer and is a right granted by our country. Regardless of one s stance concealed carry is currently permitted in all 50 states in the country.  Some states have policies that require the possession of a permit to carry a firearm some have limitations to permits and some have unrestricted carry laws. Though concealed carry is permitted in the U.S. state and federal laws continually change to address public concerns. As such it is necessary to stay updated on various significant alterations and amendments regarding firearm carry legislation across the United States. BillTrack50 is your free source for staying uptodate with new legislation across the country including information about firearms. We ve highlighted significant updates to concealed carry legislation below.  Numerous states currently have policies in place for the permitless carry of firearms like the states of Texas and Arizona. Conversely there are also those that require a permit or license for the concealed carry of a firearm such as the states of Nevada and Florida. No matter the legislation in place in various states the option of participating in a concealed firearm permit course remains for all individuals wanting to take part in doing so. Processes differ for available courses but generally revolve around the safety of firearms.  Typically firearm permit courses enable individuals to obtain education and training on how to properly and safely handle use and store firearms. After completion participants are granted a permit for concealed carry in their state. The safety courses are taught by certified instructors who know about firearm safety and usage so participants can handle firearms responsibly. For example the Concealed Firearm Permit Course in Las Vegas is conducted by a certified firearms permit instructor with extensive knowledge about state laws and concealed carry permits. Visitors do not need to bring ammunition or any sort of tactical gear with them to the course. While legislation regarding the requirement of permits for concealed carry varies across the nation the option to participate in a course remains an option. In April of 2022 the Georgia Constitutional Carry Act of 2021 SB319 was signed and enacted by the state and its legislators. This kind of legislation regarding firearms is often found to be controversial by individuals and organizations alike because it eliminates the need for a permit for concealed carry. This constitutional carry bill that was passed allows eligible qualified Georgia residents to now carry a concealed firearm without having to obtain a license or permit to do so.  Anywhere a licensed firearm owner can hold one so could a resident carry a concealed firearm. The policy supports the constitutional right to bear arms by removing restrictions on carrying firearms in parks historic sites and recreational areas in the state. Restrictions in airports and government buildings remain in place. A major bill the Constitutional Carry Act makes Georgia the 25th state in the country to not have legislation that requires a permit to carry in public. Similar bills have been introduced andor signed across the country. Louisiana lawmakers have advanced legislation HB 37 that would enable residents to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. This bill would be a massive step towards enabling residents to protect themselves and their families through concealed carry. It would remove the current requirement for a permit for concealed carry in the open carry state. The bill applies to residents that are 21 years of age and older that are not prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or federal law. Should the legislation pass Louisiana would follow Georgia as another state that has constitutional carry legislation. In Minnesota amendments to the Personal Protection Act HF3023 were introduced to lawmakers this year. The bill was amended to read that an applicant for concealed carry of a firearm must present evidence that they received training in the safe use of a pistol within a year of the date of their application either through employment as a peace officer or with completion of a firearms safety or training course by a certified instructor. In addition to amending language in the Personal Protection Act the legislation proposed would create lifetime permits to carry handguns without the need for permit renewals every five years which is currently required in the state. The legislation would also reduce the permit to carry application fee for applicable residents. Like the state of Louisiana North Carolina also has their own Constitutional Carry Act H197 that is being considered by lawmakers. This legislation would enable eligible North Carolina residents that are 18 years of age and older to carry a concealed firearm without a permit. This move would remove obstacles to exercising their Second Amendment rights in the state. The bill in question would continue to allow individuals to acquire a concealed carry permit if desired the permit would become optional. If the bill passes North Carolina would be joining the constitutional carry wave sweeping the nation.  Earlier in 2022 Nebraska introduced a bill LB 773 that would have eliminated concealed carry permit requirements in the state. It also would have gotten rid of the need to pass a criminal background check and the passing of a gun safety course. However the bill was postponed indefinitely by lawmakers in April. Nebraska remains an open carry state. This year Ohio passed a bill allowing for constitutional carry. The law made Ohio the 23rd state to pass a law regarding the permitless carrying of a firearm. SB215 allows qualified adults that are 21 years of age and not legally prohibited from possessing a firearm under state or federal law to carry a firearm without having to obtain a license. Permits are now optional. Lawabiding citizens may now carry a firearm concealed in the open carry state.  In addition it is no longer required for residents to complete the eighthour training course including two hours of inperson range time after the law goes into effect. It should be noted that SB215 does not impact the requirement for individuals to pass a background check to purchase or possess a firearm in the state. Ohio s law allowing for constitutional carry goes into effect on June 13th of this year. Representatives in Pennsylvania are discussing a bill HB659 that would allow for concealed carry without the need to obtain a permit for eligible adults over 18 years of age. Instead obtaining a license to carry a firearm would be optional for residents. Should the legislation pass Pennsylvania would be yet another state in the country to have constitutional carry.   Perhaps one of the most significant pieces of legislation regarding concealed carrying of guns in America is the federal Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act. It is a significant step in ensuring that Americans that want to carry a concealed firearm are supported by the country rather than criminalized. The Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act HR 38 is currently in committee in U.S. Congress in the House. First introduced last year this legislation aims to regulate the carry or possession of concealed firearms across state lines. The bill would amend Title 18 of the United States Code requiring all states to recognize concealed carry permits or licenses granted by other states.  The legislation would allow those with permits to travel freely between states with their concealed firearm so long as that other state also allows residents to carry concealed firearms. This also applies to residents of states allowing constitutional carry. It would allow Americans to carry their legal concealed firearm without risking breaking the laws of other states they visit or pass through. H.R. 38 is a bill that would guarantee Second Amendment rights acknowledging the right to carry a firearm so long as laws of the state are followed by the individual. If passed by the House it would then be passed to the Senate to be reviewed and either approved or rejected. It is a common misconception that constitutional carry means that anyone and everyone can carry a gun. However there are still limitations to concealed carry legislation. U.S. gun laws are in place to regulate the purchasing and carrying of firearms. Besides differing age requirements for concealed carry in states those that have been convicted of a felony or are prohibited by law from purchasing a firearm are unable to participate in permitless carry. Current legislation only applies to qualified lawabiding residents of these states.  Since legislation regarding firearms is continually changing it is crucial to stay informed about bills and legislators in your state and on a federal level. Whether you are a gun owner or not having the proper information about current legislation in the country being addressed or enacted keeps you knowledgeable about rights on state and federal levels. BillTrack50 can help you stay informed about firearm legislation and more providing the latest updates on new and trending legislation being proposed across the country.
https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/analysis/concealed-carry.html, Apart from specifying classes of people who are prohibited from possessing any type of firearm federal law imposes no restrictions on who may carry a concealed weapon in public although it specifically grants concealedcarry rights to active and retired law enforcement officers 18 U.S.C. 926. State laws typically specify who may carry concealed weapons and the procedures those people must follow when they wish to exercise this right. We found no qualifying studies showing that concealedcarry laws decreased any of the eight outcomes we investigated. Prior to the Civil War most states lacked legislation on the legality of carrying concealed weapons. States that did have such laws prohibited the practice. Following World War II most states adopted laws giving law enforcement agencies discretion over who could carry concealed weapons Cramer and Kopel 2005. In the 1980s 1990s and early 2000s a majority of states relaxed restrictions on concealed handguns. Several states allow individuals to carry concealed weapons without a permit referred to as permitless carry but most require gun owners to obtain a permit to carry a concealed handgun. Some states have shifted from laws that restrict concealedcarry permits to those who can demonstrate a legitimate need to carry a weapon or that give law enforcement some discretion in issuing concealedcarry permits referred to as mayissue laws to laws that guarantee the right to a concealedcarry permit for all citizens who are not prohibited from possessing a handgun referred to as shallissue or righttocarry laws. In the 2022 New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen decision the Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional the use of subjective criteria in granting concealedcarry permits overturning the mayissue law in New York and prompting changes to laws in at least five other mayissue states. A key difference among these law categories is that permitlesscarry laws do not require individuals to obtain a permit or license before they can carry a concealed weapon while mayissue and shallissue laws set forth conditions by which such permits may be granted. Because of the permitting discretion previously allowed in states with mayissue laws these laws are generally perceived as more restrictive than shallissue laws. Indeed RowhaniRahbar et al. 2017 found large differences in the percentage of adults who routinely carried a loaded weapon between states with different concealedcarry laws. In states with morerestrictive mayissue laws only 9.1 percent of handgun owners carried their firearm in a 30day period. In contrast in states with shallissue and permitlesscarry laws more than 20 percent of handgun owners did so. And although data on the number of persons with concealedcarry permits are not readily available for many states recent estimates suggest that the number of concealedcarry permit holders in the United States was around 14 million in 2015 RowhaniRahbar et al. 2017 and was more than 21.5 million in 2021 Lott Moody and Wang 2021 with substantial variation across states depending on the permit fees in place the amount of time that the law has been in effect and whether the law allows local authorities to exercise discretion in issuing permits i.e. mayissue versus shallissue. There are several ways that concealedcarry laws could affect gun violence and there is considerable disagreement about which laws are most likely to do so. By increasing the number of people carrying guns in public permitlesscarry and shallissue laws that make it easier for citizens to carry concealed weapons could lead to increased crime and violence if disagreements perceived threats and conflicts are more likely to result in casualties when a handgun is readily available. Alternatively concealedcarry laws could lead to reductions in the prevalence or severity of violent crime and mass shootings either because the prospect of encountering an armed victim serves as a deterrent or because victims will more frequently be able to use a gun to defend themselves Fortunato 2015. One analysis of 433 active shooter incidents from 2000 through 2021 found that 64 of these 15 percent ended because a bystander shot n 22 or otherwise subdued n 42 the attacker Buchanan and Leatherby 2022. Whether those who carry concealed weapons pose an elevated or reduced risk of crime or violence is the subject of debate Violence Policy Center 2017 Lott Whitley and Riley 2016. A comparison of criminal conviction rates among holders and nonholders of concealed handgun licenses in Texas found that license holders were less likely to be convicted of crimes but the license holders convictions were significantly more likely to involve deadly conduct and intentional killings Phillips et al. 2013.1 The likelihood of encountering an armed victim may further lead to increased gun violence by inducing more criminals to carry and use firearms. Alternatively these laws may result in criminals deciding to pursue other types of crime such as larceny for which the probability of encountering armed resistance is lower Kovandzic and Marvell 2003. There are several other mechanisms by which changes in firearm availability and carrying behavior induced by concealedcarry laws could influence violent crime. If morepermissive concealedcarry laws increase public carrying of firearms these laws could increase criminal access to guns through theft which may subsequently increase the use of guns in criminal activity. Indeed two recent working papers suggest that stolen guns are an important mechanism that links concealedcarry laws with crime outcomes Billings 2022 Donohue et al. 2022. Differences in concealedcarry policies may also prompt changes in law enforcement behavior for example through reallocating officer effort e.g. processing permit applications. Changes in police expectations and activities could influence violent crime through effects on officers effectiveness in deterring and solving crimes Donohue et al. 2022. Furthermore by changing officer perceptions about the likelihood of encountering an armed person during officercivilian interactions concealedcarry laws may directly affect police shootings.2 There is likely to be little effect of concealedcarry laws on hunting or recreational gun use. However shallissue policies may encourage more individuals to obtain firearms thereby increasing handgun sales Steidley 2016. To assess these or any other effects of concealedcarry laws one would ideally like to know whether there are greater increases in gun ownership and carrying in states following passage of shallissue or permitlesscarry laws compared with states that have morerestrictive laws but such data have not been collected systematically over time. The direct effects of increases in concealed carrying by private citizens on suicides unintentional injuries and deaths and defensive gun use should be strongest for incidents involving handguns and that occur outside the home where the laws apply. Similarly for violent crime one would expect concealedcarry laws to have greater effects either negative or positive depending on the role of deterrence on assaults or homicides occurring in public venues compared with those occurring within the home. Should the effects of concealedcarry laws be driven primarily by expanding the prevalence of gun ownership then these effects could extend to both private and public areas for such outcomes as suicides firearm homicides and unintentional injuries and deaths.  DC   DC   DC  As of January 1 2021 16 states have laws allowing people to carry concealed weapons without first receiving a permit that includes Vermont which has never required a permit for concealed carry.3 Mississippi allows concealed carry without a permit if the handgun is kept in a sheath belt holster or shoulder holster or in a purse handbag satchel other similar bag or briefcase or fully enclosed case.4 Twentysix states and the District of Columbia have shallissue laws under which law enforcement agencies have no or very limited discretion to deny concealedcarry permits to citizens who are otherwise permitted to possess handguns.5 Eight states have mayissue laws in which law enforcement agencies have significant discretionary authority to deny permits.6 Many states have reciprocity clauses in their concealedcarry permit laws meaning that they recognize the concealedcarry permits issued by some but not necessarily all other states United States Concealed Carry Association 2013. Often states honor permits only from other states with laws similar to their own. There are some states however that recognize concealedcarry permits from states with lessrestrictive laws. For instance Delaware has a mayissue law but recognizes concealedcarry permits from several states with shallissue laws USA Carry 2017. View the full project bibliography

Don t get me wrong there is a time and place to openly carry a firearm depending on your objective but as a police officer I believe open carry increases your risk and puts you at a tactical disadvantage while concealed carry improves your safety. Before discussing the reasons why you should consider concealed carry there are a few things from my vantage point as a police officer I would like you to consider. Openly carrying a firearm simply means that the firearm is visible to the public. This is also sometimes referred to as permitless carry or constitutional carry. Carrying a concealed firearm means that the firearm is not visible to the public. Why might a citizen legally open carry? Well there are at least two logical or at least somewhat sensible reasons for this. First a public exercise of a citizen s Second Amendment right to bear arms. This is probably the most common reason or at least it is the reason that gets the most attention. A public display is the best opportunity for you to publicly exercise your legal right and support for the Second Amendment. If you do decide to demonstrate that right through open carry I recommend it is always best to partake in that activity in a large group and preferably at a scheduled event known to law enforcement. Law enforcement officers are often the greatest supporters of the Second Amendment. When law enforcement is notified of a Second Amendment open carry demonstration it is a courtesy that allows them to plan accordingly. When they understand what is occurring they can coordinate assets to ensure it is done safely and they can also disregard or better assess any 911 calls that may occur. The second reason citizens openly carry a firearm is that it is typically more comfortable. While this can be true there is likely a handgun and holster combination that will work for you to comfortably conceal carry. There are several legitimate ways to carry a firearm in a comfortable and concealed manner. While opencarrying a firearm does offer you the protection you are looking for it also puts you at risk in what I believe are more likely scenarios. What you are losing in my opinion from open carrying is far more valuable than what you think you are achieving. If survival is the most important thing to you then you may have to abandon comfort as your priority. Although your intentions are good I discourage open carry for these reasons. If you are part of a large open carry group it makes it more obvious to law enforcement that you are part of a demonstration and not in the process of committing an illegal act. When someone calls 911 and an officer is dispatched it is the officer s duty to investigate. Quite frankly it can be a major inconvenience for both parties. In the worstcase scenario you could end up in a confrontation with a police officer who mishandles the situation. Open carry laws differ by state. Some states still require those who open carry a firearm to have a license to do so while other states consider open carry lawful without needing a permit. Other states like Illinois and California prohibit openly carrying a firearm altogether. Texas recently passed HB127 which made it legal for most people over 21 to carry a handgun openly or concealed without a license so long as the handgun is in a holster. Even though HB127 was passed there are still benefits to obtaining a Texas License to Carry. Police officers are hyperaware or hypervigilant of their surroundings at least while on duty and when in uniform because they are targets. While in uniform officers must be aware of their surroundings to thwart or identify an attack early. Another reason for officers to be especially aware of their surroundings while in uniform is because they are carrying a handgun on their hip and the threat of someone attempting to disarm them is very real. From 20022011 543 police officers were feloniously killed and 5.1 28 of those officers were killed with their own weapon after being disarmed. Even under circumstances where officers do not expect criminal behavior they must be conscious of how they may be exposing their firearm to citizens in everyday encounters as well as when questioning and arresting suspects. This might mean standing sideways with their gun to the counter at the gas station while they are checking out to prevent the possibility of a citizen having access to it. Fortunately the number of officers being disarmed andor being killed with their firearm has significantly decreased in recent years. Together increased levels of training through defensive tactics firearms retention techniques and advancements in holster retention systems are reducing the risk of officers being injured or killed with their own weapon. Frankly most citizens do not have a similar level of training and most do not carry in holsters with retention systems. Are you willing to be hyperaware of the people around you when you are openly carrying a handgun? Do you want to be that mindful of how you stand and the people around you while you are trying to have a good time with your family? You should never be completely unaware of your surroundings. However open carrying a handgun should change your posture and over time that can become physically and mentally exhausting. Do you assume that by open carrying a handgun you are representing a show of force and a deterrent to criminals? That may be the case occasionally but you are also making yourself a target a target to be disarmed and a target to become the unintentional victim of a crime of opportunity. Imagine standing in line at a grocery store when a subject walks to the cash register with the intent to commit an armed robbery. Instead of being bypassed by the subject and likely disregarded entirely the subject now feels the need to deal with you because the subject knows you are armed. It is possible that openly carrying a firearm will deter a suspect from committing a violent act. While this is a possibility a violent criminal may still view you as a threat that they need to deal with. I have spent thousands of hours conducting surveillance on violent criminals who conduct aggravated robberies. I have seen aggravated robberies occur in a strongarm type of manner that takes minutes to execute. From the moment they enter the location they are committed with guns clearly visible. They will not suddenly turn around and walk away if they see you open carrying. I have also seen suspects take several hours or even days while they are conducting their own surveillance before they act. In 2019 a Houston police officer in full uniform was disarmed during an aggravated robbery. If the prize is high enough and the suspect is truly dedicated openly carrying a firearm likely will not discourage them. When open carrying a handgun your opportunity to get the drop on the bad guy with a gun is likely lost. If a subject with a firearm has you at gunpoint what options do you have? A move to your handgun will likely get you shot. In fact it is probably in your best interest to keep your hands far away from your handgun at that point which also means there is a high probability of being disarmed. You have taken yourself out of the fight before ever having the opportunity to be in the fight. Carrying a handgun concealed allows you to remain covert in your carry until it makes sense for you to draw. If it makes sense to draw at all. At a minimum it allows you to appear as an innocent bystander and there is less chance of being targeted. If you are the victim of a robbery there is a good chance you can stall delay or even distract the bad guy long enough to draw your handgun if you think it is necessary. Carrying a firearm is a tremendous responsibility that should not be taken lightly. Even when you have good intentions things can go wrong and the margin for error is small. Therefore it is in your best interest to give yourself the tactical advantage by seeking out advanced levels of civilian firearms training and knowing your state laws on carrying a firearm.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concealed_carry_in_the_United_States, Concealed carry or carrying a concealed weapon CCW is the practice of carrying a weapon such as a handgun in public in a concealed manner either on ones person or in close proximity. CCW is often practiced as a means of selfdefense. Following the Supreme Courts NYSRPA v. Bruen 2022 decision all states in the United States were required to allow for concealed carry of a handgun either permitlessly or with a permit although the difficulty in obtaining a permit varies per jurisdiction. There is conflicting evidence regarding the effect that concealed carry has on crime rates. A 2020 review by the RAND Corporation concluded there is supportive evidence that shallissue concealed carry laws which require states to issue permits to applicants once certain requirements are met are associated with increased firearm homicides and total homicides. 1 Earlier studies by RAND found that shallissue concealed carry laws may increase violent crime overall while there was inconclusive evidence for the effect of shallissue laws on all individual types of violent crime. 2 A 2004 literature review by the National Academy of Sciences concluded that there is no link between the existence of laws that allow concealed carry and crime rates. 3  The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the right to keep and bear arms. Concealed weapons bans were passed in Kentucky and Louisiana in 1813. In those days open carry of weapons for selfdefense was considered acceptable concealed carry was denounced as the practice of criminals. By 1859 Indiana Tennessee Virginia Alabama and Ohio had followed suit. 4 By the end of the nineteenth century similar laws were passed in places such as Texas Florida and Oklahoma which protected some gun rights in their state constitutions. 5 Before the mid1900s most U.S. states had passed concealed carry laws rather than banning weapons completely. 6 Until the late 1990s many Southern states were either NoIssue or Restrictive MayIssue. Since then these states have largely enacted ShallIssue licensing laws with more than half of the states legalizing Constitutional carry unrestricted concealed carry and the remaining Mayissue licensing laws being abolished in 2022 by the U.S. Supreme Court. Historically some states were considered mayissue jurisdictions where an applicant was required to provide a proper cause or need to be issued a permit to carry a concealed weapon. However on June 23 2022 these laws were found unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in New York State Rifle Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen. Regulations differ widely by state with twentyseven of the fifty states either currently maintaining a constitutional carry policy or implementing it in the near future. The Federal GunFree School Zones Act limits where an unlicensed person may carry carry of a weapon openly or concealed within 1000 feet 300 m of a school zone is prohibited with exceptions granted in the federal law to holders of valid stateissued weapons permits state laws may reassert the illegality of school zone carry by license holders and under LEOSA to current and honorably retired law enforcement officers regardless of permit usually overriding state law. When in contact with an officer some states require individuals to inform that officer that they are carrying a handgun. 7 8  Not all weapons that fall under CCW laws are lethal. For example in Florida carrying pepper spray in more than a specified volume 2 oz. of chemical requires a CCW permit whereas everyone may legally carry a smaller selfdefense chemical spray device hidden on their person without a CCW permit. 9 10 As of 2021 update there have been 21.52 million concealed weapon permits issued in the United States. 11   Jurisdiction gives no minimum age to conceal carry in law. The age is set at 18 by federal law. An unrestricted jurisdiction is one in which a permit is not required to carry a concealed handgun. This is sometimes called constitutional carry. Within the unrestricted category there exist states that are fully unrestricted where no permit is required for lawful open or concealed carry and partially unrestricted where certain forms of concealed carry may be legal without a permit while other forms of carry may require a permit. Some states have a limited form of permitless carry restricted based on one or more of the following a persons location the loadedunloaded state of the firearm or the specific persons who may carry without a permit. As of February 18 2021 update these states are Illinois New Mexico and Washington. Some states that allow permitless concealed carry and still issue concealed carry permits may impose restrictions on concealed carry for certain places andor at certain times e.g. special events large public gatherings etc.. In some such situations those holding a valid concealed carry permit may be exempt from such restrictions. A permit requirement jurisdiction is one in which a governmentissued permit is required to carry a concealed handgun in public. Before the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in New York State Rifle Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen these jurisdictions were further split between shallissue which is the current national licensing standard where the granting of licenses is subject only to meeting determinate criteria laid out in the law and mayissue where the granting of such licenses was at the discretion of local authorities. Since the abolishment of mayissue permitting the U.S. Supreme Court has stated it is still legal for U.S. jurisdictions subject to the Constitution to require a permit to carry a concealed handgun and that background checks training and proper fees can be required without violating the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution which guarantees a right of the people to carry a concealed firearm outside of the home. While members of the Armed Services may receive extensive small arms training United States Military installations have some of the most restrictive rules for the possession transport and carrying of personallyowned firearms in the country. Overall authority for carrying a personallyowned firearm on a military installation rests with the installation commander although the authority to permit individuals to carry firearms on an installation is usually delegated to the Provost Marshal. Military installations do not recognize stateissued concealed carry permits and state firearms laws generally do not apply to military bases regardless of the state in which the installation is located. Federal law 18 USC Section 930 generally forbids the possession transport and carrying of firearms on military installations without approval from the installation commander. Federal law gives installation commanders wide discretion in establishing firearms policies for their respective installations. In practice local discretion is often constrained by policies and directives from the headquarters of each military branch and major commands. Installation policies can vary from noissue for most bases to shallissue in rare circumstances. Installations that do allow the carrying of firearms typically restrict carrying to designated areas and for specific purposes i.e. hunting or officially sanctioned shooting competitions in approved locations on the installation. Installation commanders may require the applicant to complete extensive firearms safety training undergo a mental health evaluation and obtain a letter of recommendation from their unit commander or employer before such authorization is granted. Personnel that reside on a military installation are typically required to store their personallyowned firearms in the installation armory although the installation commander or provost marshal may permit a service member to store their personal firearms in their onbase dwelling if they have a gun safe or similarly designed cabinet where the firearms can be secured. Prior to 2011 military commanders could impose firearms restrictions to servicemembers residing offbase such as mandatory registration of firearms with the base provost marshal restricting or banning the carrying of firearms by servicemembers either on or off the installation regardless of whether the member had a state permit to carry and requiring servicemembers to have a gun safe or similar container to secure firearms when not in use. A provision was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 that limited commanders authority to impose restrictions on the possession and use of personallyowned firearms by service members who reside offbase. Concealed carry policies on Native American reservations are covered by the tribal laws for each reservation which vary widely from NoIssue to ShallIssue and Unrestricted either in law or in practice. Some Native American tribes recognize concealed carry permits for the states in which the reservation is located while others do not. For reservations that do not recognize stateissued concealed carry permits some completely ban concealed carry while others offer a tribal permit for concealed carry issued by the tribal police or tribal council. Tribal concealed carry permits may be available to the general populace or limited to tribal members depending on tribal policies. Tribal law typically preempts state law on the reservation. The only exception is while traversing the reservation on a stateowned highway including interstate U.S. routes and in some instances county roads in which case state law and the federal Firearm Owners Protection Act FOPA apply. Prohibitions of the concealed carry of firearms and other weapons by local governments predate the establishment of the United States. In 1686 New Jersey law stated no person or persons shall presume privately to wear any pocket pistol or other unusual or unlawful weapons within this Province. After the federal government was established states and localities continued to restrict people from carrying hidden weapons. Tennessee law prohibited this as early as 1821. By 1837 Georgia passed into effect An Act to guard and protect the citizens of this State against the unwarrantable and too prevalent use of deadly weapons. Two years later Alabama followed suit with An Act to Suppress the Evil Practice of Carrying Weapons Secretly. Delaware prohibited the practice in 1852. 39 Ohio did the same in 1859 a policy that remained in effect until 1974. 40 Cities also regulated weapons within their boundaries. In 1881 Tombstone Arizona enacted Ordinance No. 9 To Provide against Carrying of Deadly Weapons a regulation that sparked the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral later that year. Some permit requirement jurisdictions allow issuing authorities to impose limitations on CCW permits such as the type and caliber of handguns that may be carried Rhode Island New Mexico restrictions on places where the permit is valid New York Massachusetts Illinois restricting concealed carry to purposes or activities specified on the approved permit application California Massachusetts New Jersey New York limitations on magazine size Connecticut Massachusetts New York or limitations on the number of firearms that may be carried concealed by a permitholder at any given time some states. Permits issued by all but two states New York and Hawaii are valid statewide. New York State pistol licenses which are generally issued by counties are valid statewide with one exception. A permit not issued by New York City is invalid in that city unless validated by its police commissioner. 41 42 Permits issued by Hawaii are valid only in the county of issuance. Some states require concealed carry applicants to certify their proficiency with a firearm through some type of training or instruction. Certain training courses developed by the National Rifle Association that combine classroom and livefire instruction typically meet most state training requirements. Some states recognize prior military or police service as meeting training requirements. 43  Classroom instruction would typically include firearm mechanics and terminology cleaning and maintenance of a firearm concealed carry legislation and limitations liability issues carry methods and safety home defense methods for managing and defusing confrontational situations and practice of gun handling techniques without firing the weapon. Most required CCW training courses devote a considerable amount of time to liability issues. Depending on the state a practical component during which the attendee shoots the weapon for the purpose of demonstrating safety and proficiency may be required. During range instruction applicants would typically learn and demonstrate safe handling and operation of a firearm and accurate shooting from common selfdefense distances. Some states require a certain proficiency to receive a passing grade whereas other states e.g. Florida technically require only a single shot to be fired to demonstrate handgun handling proficiency. CCW training courses are typically completed in a single day and are good for a set period the exact duration varying by state. Some states require retraining sometimes in a shorter simpler format for each renewal. A few states e.g. South Carolina recognize the safety and useofforce training given to military personnel as acceptable in lieu of formal civilian training certification. Such states will ask for a military ID South Carolina for active persons or DD214 for honorably discharged persons. These few states will commonly request a copy of the applicants BTR Basic Training Record proving an uptodate pistol qualification. Active and retired law enforcement officers are generally exempt from qualification requirements due to a federal statute permitting qualified active and retired law enforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in the United States. 44  Virginia recognizes eight specific training options to prove competency in handgun handling ranging from DD214 for honorably discharged military veterans to certification from law enforcement training to firearms training conducted by a state or NRAcertified firearms instructor including electronic video or online courses. While any one of the eight listed options will be considered adequate proof individual circuit courts may recognize other training options. 43 A small number of states such as Alabama and Georgia have no training requirements to obtain a permit only a requirement that the applicant successfully pass the required background check before issuance. Level of permit reciprocity recognition of outofstate permits 13  Many jurisdictions recognize honor a permit or license issued by other jurisdictions. Recognition may be granted to all jurisdictions or some subset that meets a set of permitissuing criteria such as training comparable to the honoring jurisdiction or certain background checks. Several states have entered into formal agreements to mutually recognize permits. This arrangement is commonly called reciprocity or mutual recognition. A few states do not recognize permits issued by any other jurisdiction but offer nonresident permits for outofstate individuals who possess a valid concealed carry permit from their home state who wish to carry while visiting such states. There are also states that neither recognize outofstate concealed carry permits nor issue permits to nonresidents resulting in a complete ban on concealed carry by nonresidents in such states. There are also states Illinois and Rhode Island that do not recognize outofstate permits for carryonfoot but do permit individuals with outofstate concealed carry permits to carry while traveling in their vehicle normally in accordance with the rules of the state of issuance. Recognition and reciprocity of concealed carry privileges vary. Some states e.g. Indiana Virginia Ohio unilaterally recognize all permits. Others such as Michigan limit such universal recognition to residents of the permitissuing state. 45 While 37 states have reciprocity agreements with at least one other state and several states honor all outofstate concealed carry permits some states have special requirements like training courses or safety exams and therefore do not honor permits from states that do not have such requirements for issue. Some states make exceptions for persons under the minimum age usually 21 if they are active or honorably discharged members of the military or a police force the second of these two is subject additionally to federal law. States that do not have this exemption generally do not recognize any license from states that do. An example of this is the state of Washingtons refusal to honor any Texas LTC as Texas has the military exception to age. 46 Idaho Mississippi North Dakota South Dakota and Tennessee have standard and enhanced permits that have different requirements to obtain and also have unique reciprocity with different states Utah and West Virginia have provisional permits for 1820yearolds with more limited recognition by other states. 47  Permits from Idaho enhanced Kansas Michigan North Dakota class 1 and North Carolina have the highest number of recognition by other states 39 states. One can obtain multiple state permits in an effort to increase the number of states where that user can carry a legally concealed weapon. It is common practice to use a CCW Reciprocity Map 48 to gain clarity on which states will honor the persons combination of resident and nonresident permits given the variety of standards and legal policies from state to state. There are also various mobile applications 49 that guide users in researching state concealed carry permit reciprocity. Although carry may be legal under State law in accordance with reciprocity agreements the Federal Gun Free School Zones Act subjects an outofstate permit holder to federal felony prosecution if they carry a firearm within 1000 feet of any K 12 schools property line however the enforcement of this statute is rare given several states nullification statutes prohibiting state law enforcement officers from enforcing federal firearms laws. However states may have their own similar statutes that such officers will enforce and potentially expose the carrier to later prosecution under the Act. While generally a concealed carry permit allows the permit holder to carry a concealed weapon in public a state may restrict carry of a firearm including a permitted concealed weapon while in or on certain properties facilities or types of businesses that are otherwise open to the public. These areas vary by state except for the first item below federal offices are subject to superseding federal law and can include Some states allow private businesses to post a specific sign prohibiting concealed carry within their premises. The exact language and format of such a sign varies by state. By posting the signs businesses create areas where it is illegal to carry a concealed handgun similar to regulations concerning schools hospitals and public gatherings. Violation of such a sign in some of these states is grounds for revocation of the offenders concealed carry permit and criminal prosecution. Other states such as Virginia enforce only trespassing laws when a person violates a Gun Free Zone sign. In some jurisdictions trespass by a person carrying a firearm may have more severe penalties than simple trespass while in other jurisdictions penalties are lower than for trespass. 51  Such states include Arizona Arkansas Connecticut Illinois Kansas Louisiana Michigan Minnesota Missouri Nebraska 52 Nevada New Mexico North Carolina Ohio Oklahoma South Carolina Tennessee Texas Virginia and Wisconsin. There is considerable dispute over the effectiveness of such gunfree zones. Opponents of such measures such as OpenCarry.org state that much like other malum prohibitum laws banning gunrelated practices only lawabiding individuals will heed the signage and disarm. Individuals or groups intent on committing far more serious crimes such as armed robbery or murder will not be deterred by signage prohibiting weapons. Further the reasoning follows that those wishing to commit mass murder might intentionally choose gunfree venues like shopping malls schools and churches where weapons carry is generally prohibited by statute or signage because the population inside is disarmed and thus less able to stop them. 53  In some states business owners have been documented posting signs that appear to prohibit guns but legally do not because the signs do not meet local or state laws defining the required appearance placement or wording of signage. Such signage can be posted out of ignorance of the law or intent to pacify gun control advocates while not actually prohibiting the practice. The force of law behind a noncompliant sign varies based on state statutes and case law. Some states interpret their statutes high level of specification of signage as evidence that the signage must meet the specification exactly and any quantifiable deviation from the statute makes the sign nonbinding. Other states have decided in case law that if efforts were made in good faith to conform to the statutes the sign carries the force of law even if it fails to meet current specifications. Still others have such lax descriptions of what is a valid sign that virtually any sign that can be interpreted as no guns allowed is binding on the license holder. citation needed  Note that virtually all jurisdictions allow some form of oral communication by the lawful owner or controller of the property that a person is not welcome and should leave. This notice can be given to anyone for any reason except for statuses that are protected by the Federal Civil Rights Act of 1964 and other CRAs such as race citation needed including due to the carrying of firearms by that person and refusal to heed such a request to leave may constitute trespassing. Printing refers to a circumstance where the shape or outline of a firearm is visible through a garment while the gun is still fully covered and is generally not desired when carrying a concealed weapon. Brandishing can refer to different actions depending on jurisdiction. These actions can include printing through a garment pulling back clothing to expose a gun or unholstering a gun and exhibiting it in the hand. The intent to intimidate or threaten someone may or may not be required legally for it to be considered brandishing. Brandishing is a crime in most jurisdictions but the definition of brandishing varies widely. Under California law the following conditions have to be present to prove brandishing 1 A person in the presence of another person drew or exhibited a deadly weapon other than a firearm firearm whether loaded or unloaded and 2 That person did so in a rude angry or threatening manner or 2 That person in any manner unlawfully used the deadly weapon firearm in a fight or quarrel . and 3 The person was not acting in lawful selfdefense. 54  It shall be unlawful for any person to point hold or brandish any firearm or any air or gas operated weapon or any object similar in appearance whether capable of being fired or not in such manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another or hold a firearm or any air or gas operated weapon in a public place in such a manner as to reasonably induce fear in the mind of another of being shot or injured. However this section shall not apply to any person engaged in excusable or justifiable selfdefense. The Gun Control Act passed by Congress in 1968 lists felons illegal aliens and other codified persons as prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. During the application process for concealed carry states carry out thorough background checks to prevent these individuals from obtaining permits. Additionally the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act created an FBImaintained system in 1994 for instantly checking the backgrounds of potential firearms buyers in an effort to prevent these individuals from obtaining weapons. The Firearm Owners Protection Act FOPA of 1986 allows a gun owner to travel through states in which their firearm possession is illegal as long as it is legal in the states of origination and destination the owner is in transit and does not remain in the state in which firearm possession is illegal and the firearm is transported unloaded and in a locked container. The FOPA addresses the issue of transport of private firearms from origin to destination for purposes lawful in state of origin and destination FOPA does not authorize concealed carry as a weapon of defense during transit. New York State Police arrested those carrying firearms in violation of state law and then required them to use FOPA as an affirmative defense to the charges of illegal possession. citation needed  In 2004 the United States Congress enacted the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act 18 U.S. Code 926B and 926C. This federal law allows two classes of persons the qualified law enforcement officer and the qualified retired law enforcement officer to carry a concealed firearm in any jurisdiction in the United States regardless of any state or local law to the contrary with the exception of areas where all firearms are prohibited without permission and certain Title II weapons. The Federal Gun Free School Zone Act limits where a person may legally carry a firearm. It does this by making it generally unlawful for an armed citizen to be within 1000 feet extending out from the property lines of a place that the individual knows or has reasonable cause to believe is a K 12 school. Although a stateissued carry permit may exempt a person from this restriction in the state that physically issued their permit it does not exempt them in other states which recognize their permit under reciprocity agreements made with the issuing state. Some federal statutes restrict the carrying of firearms on the premises of certain federal properties such as military installations or land controlled by the USACE. 56  On May 22 2009 President Barack Obama signed H.R. 627 the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 into law. The bill contained a rider introduced by Senator Tom Coburn ROK that prohibits the Secretary of the Interior from enacting or enforcing any regulations that restrict possession of firearms in National Parks or Wildlife Refuges as long as the person complies with laws of the state in which the unit is found. 57 This provision was supported by the National Rifle Association and opposed by the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence the National Parks Conservation Association and the Coalition of National Park Service Retirees among other organizations. 58 59 As of February 2010 concealed handguns are for the first time legal in all but 3 of the nations 391 national parks and wildlife refuges so long as all applicable federal state and local regulations are adhered to. 60 Hawaii is a notable exception. Concealed and open carry are both illegal in Hawaii for all except retired military or law enforcement personnel. Previously firearms were allowed into parks if cased and unloaded. Attempts were made in the 110th Congress United States House of Representatives H.R. 226 and the United States Senate S. 388 to enact legislation to compel complete reciprocity for concealed carry licenses. Opponents of national reciprocity have pointed out that this legislation would effectively require states with more restrictive standards of permit issuance e.g. training courses safety exams good cause requirements etc. to honor permits from states with more liberal issuance policies. Supporters have pointed out that the same situation already occurs with marriage certificates adoption decrees and other state documents under the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. Constitution. 61 Some states have already adopted a full faith and credit policy treating outofstate carry permits the same as outofstate drivers license or marriage certificates without federal legislation mandating such a policy. 62 In the 115th Congress another universal reciprocity bill the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 was introduced by Richard Hudson. The bill passed the House but did not get a vote in the Senate. 63  Prior to the 1897 Supreme Court case Robertson v. Baldwin 64 the federal courts had been silent on the issue of concealed carry. In the dicta from a maritime law case the Supreme Court commented that state laws restricting concealed weapons do not infringe upon the right to bear arms protected by the federal Second Amendment. 65 However in the context of such rulings open carry of firearms was generally unrestricted in the jurisdictions in question which provided an alternative means of bearing arms. In the majority decision in the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia v. Heller Justice Antonin Scalia wrote Like most rights the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose For example concealed weapons prohibitions have been upheld under the Amendment or state analogues ... The majority of the 19thcentury courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment or state analogs. 66  Heller was a landmark case because for the first time in United States history a Supreme Court decision defined the right to bear arms as constitutionally guaranteed to private citizens rather than a right restricted to wellregulated militias. The Justices asserted that sensible restrictions on the right to bear arms are constitutional however an outright ban on a specific type of firearm in this case handguns was in fact unconstitutional. The Heller decision is limited because it only applies to federal enclaves such as the District of Columbia. In 2010 the SCOTUS expanded Heller in McDonald v. Chicago incorporating the 2nd Amendment through the 14th Amendment as applying to local and state laws. Various Circuit Courts have upheld their local and state laws using intermediate scrutiny. The correct standard is a strict scrutiny review for all fundamental and individual rights. 67 68 On June 28 2010 the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the handgun ban enacted by the city of Chicago Illinois in McDonald v. Chicago effectively extending the Heller decision to states and local governments nationwide. 69 Banning handguns in any jurisdiction has the effect of rendering invalid any licensed individuals right to carry concealed in that area except for federally exempted retired and current law enforcement officers and other government employees acting in the discharge of their official duties. In 2022 the Supreme Court ruled in New York State Rifle Pistol Association Inc. v. Bruen that the Second Amendment does protect an individuals right to carry a handgun for selfdefense outside the home. The case struck down New Yorks strict law requiring people to show proper cause in order to get a concealed weapons permit and could affect similar laws in other states such as California Hawaii Maryland Massachusetts New Jersey and Rhode Island. 70 Shortly after the Supreme Court ruling the attorney generals of each of California 71 Hawaii concealedcarry licenses only 72 Maryland 73 Massachusetts 74 New Jersey 75 and Rhode Island permits issued by municipalities only 76 issued guidance that their proper cause or similar requirements would no longer be enforced. Even when selfdefense is justified there can be serious civil or criminal liabilities related to selfdefense when a concealed carry permit holder brandishes or fires their weapon. For example if innocent bystanders are hurt or killed there could be both civil and criminal liabilities even if the use of deadly force was completely justified. 77 78 Some states technically allow an assailant who is shot by a gun owner to bring a civil action. In some states liability is present when a resident brandishes the weapon threatens use or exacerbates a volatile situation or when the resident is carrying it while intoxicated. It is important to note that simply pointing a firearm at any person constitutes felony assault with a deadly weapon unless circumstances validate a demonstration of force. A majority of states that allow concealed carry however forbid suits being brought in such cases either by barring lawsuits for damages resulting from a criminal act on the part of the plaintiff or by granting the gun owner immunity from such a civil suit if it is found that they were justified in shooting. Simultaneously increased passage of Castle Doctrine laws allow persons who own firearms andor carry them concealed to use them without first attempting to retreat. The Castle Doctrine typically applies to situations within the confines of ones own home. 79 Nevertheless many states have adopted escalation of force laws along with provisions for concealed carry. These include the necessity to first verbally warn a trespasser or lay hands on a trespasser before a shooting is justified unless the trespasser is armed or assumed to be so. This escalation of force does not apply if the shooter reasonably believes a violent felony has been or is about to be committed on the property by the trespasser. Additionally some states have a duty to retreat provision which requires a permit holder especially in public places to vacate themself from a potentially dangerous situation before resorting to deadly force. The duty to retreat does not restrictively apply in a persons home or business though escalation of force may be required. In 1895 the Supreme Court ruled in Beard v. United States that if an individual does not provoke an assault and is residing in a place they have a right to be then they may use considerable force against someone they reasonably believe may do them serious harm without being charged with murder or manslaughter should that person be killed. 80 Further in Texas 81 and California 82 83 homicide is justifiable solely in defense of property. In other states lethal force is authorized only when serious harm is presumed to be imminent. Even given these relaxed restrictions on the use of force using a handgun must still be a last resort in some jurisdictions meaning the user must reasonably believe that nothing short of deadly force will protect the life or property at stake in a situation. Additionally civil liabilities for errors that cause harm to others still exist although civil immunity is provided in the Castle Doctrine laws of some states e.g. Texas. 84  Criminal possession of a weapon is the unlawful possession of a weapon by a citizen. Many societies both past and present have placed restrictions on what forms of weaponry private citizens and to a lesser extent police are allowed to purchase own and carry in public. Such crimes are public order crimes and are considered mala prohibita in that the possession of a weapon in and of itself is not evil. Rather the potential for use in acts of unlawful violence creates a possible need to control them. Some restrictions are strict liability whereas others require some element of intent to use the weapon for an illegal purpose. Some regulations allow a citizen to obtain a permit or other authorization to possess the weapon under certain circumstances. Lawful uses of weapons by civilians commonly include hunting sport collection and selfpreservation. The penalties for carrying a firearm in an unlawful manner vary widely from statetostate and may range from a simple infraction punishable by a fine to a felony conviction and mandatory incarceration. An individual may also be charged and convicted of criminal charges other than unlawful possession of a firearm such as assault disorderly conduct disturbing the peace or trespassing. In the case of an individual with no prior criminal convictions the state of Tennessee classifies the unlawful concealed carry of a loaded handgun as a Class C misdemeanor punishable by a maximum of 30 days imprisonment andor a 500 fine. 85 While in New York State a similar crime committed by an individual with no criminal convictions is classified as a Class D felony punishable by a mandatory minimum of 3.5 years imprisonment to a maximum of 7 years. 86 87 As New York State does not recognize any pistol permits issued in other states the statute would apply to any individual who does not have a valid New York State issued concealed carry permit even if such individual has a valid permit issued in another jurisdiction. 88 In addition the New York State statutory definition of a loaded firearm differs significantly from what may be commonly understood as simply possessing any ammunition along with a weapon capable of firing such ammunition satisfies the legal definition of a loaded firearm in New York. 89 The large variability of state carry laws has resulted in confusing circumstances where a person in Vermont which requires no license of any kind to carry a concealed weapon by anyone who is not prohibited by law could unwittingly travel into the adjacent state of New York where such individual despite acting entirely within the law of Vermont would then face a mandatory 3.5year prison sentence simply for accidentally crossing the states border into New York. These circumstances are aggravated by the fact that many NYS police departments as well as the New York State Police do not recognize the protections granted federally under the Firearm Owners Protection Act which was intended to prevent such prosecutions. 90  Research has had mixed results indicating variously that righttocarry laws have no impact on violent crime that they increase violent crime and that they decrease violent crime. A 2020 study by the RAND Corporation of over 200 combinations of gun policies and outcomes found supportive evidence that shallissue concealed carry laws are associated with increased firearm homicides and total homicides. They also found supportive evidence that child access prevention laws reduce firearm homicides and selfinjuries among youth and further evidence supporting the conclusion that standyourground laws are associated with increased levels of firearm homicides. 1 The researchers credit a much greater investment in gun safety research over the past few years with providing this and other more recent studies with stronger and more reliable evidence. A 2004 review of the existing literature by the National Academy of Sciences found that the results of existing studies were sensitive to the specification and time period examined and concluded that a causal link between righttocarry laws and crime rates cannot be shown. 3 Quinnipiac University economist Mark Gius summarized literature published between 1993 and 2005 and found that ten papers suggested that permissive CCW laws reduce crime one paper suggested they increase crime and nine papers showed no definitive results. 91 A 2017 review of the existing literature concluded Given the most recent evidence we conclude with considerable confidence that deregulation of gun carrying over the last four decades has undermined public safety which is to say that restricting concealed carry is one gun regulation that appears to be effective. 92 A 2016 study in the European Economic Review which examined the conflicting claims in the existing literature concluded that the evidence CCW either increases or decreases crime on average seems weak the studys model found some support to the law having a negative but with a positive trend effect on property crimes and a small but positive and increasing effect on violent crimes. 93 The Washington Post factchecker concluded that it could not state that CCW laws reduced crime as the evidence was murky and in dispute. 94 In a 2017 article in the journal Science Stanford University law professor John Donohue and Duke University economist Philip J. Cook write that there is an emerging consensus that on balance the causal effect of deregulating concealed carry by replacing a restrictive law with an RTC law has been to increase violent crime. 95 Donohue and Cook argue that the crack epidemic made it difficult to determine the causal effects of CCW laws and that this made earlier results inconclusive recent research does not suffer the same challenges with causality. 95 A 2018 RAND review of the literature concluded that concealed carry either has no impact on crime or that it may increase violent crime. The review said We found no qualifying studies showing that concealedcarry laws decreased violent crime. 96  A 2020 study in PNAS found that righttocarry laws were associated with higher firearm deaths. 98 A 2019 panel study published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine by medical researchers including Michael Siegel of the Boston University School of Public Health and David Hemenway of the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health found that shall issue concealed carry laws were associated with a 9 increase in homicides. 99 A 2019 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that greater restrictions on concealed carry laws were associated with decreases in workplace homicide rates. 100 Another 2019 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that states with righttocarry laws were associated with a 29 higher rate of firearm workplace homicides. 101 A 2019 study in the Journal of Empirical Legal Studies found that righttocarry laws led to an increase in overall violent crime. 102 A 2017 study in the American Journal of Public Health found that shallissue laws where concealed carry permits must be given if criteria are met are associated with significantly higher rates of total firearmrelated and handgunrelated homicide than mayissue laws where local law enforcement have discretion over who can get a concealed carry permit. 103 A 2011 study found that aggravated assaults increase when concealed carry laws are adopted. 104  A 2019 study in Journal of American College of Surgeons found no statistically significant association between the liberalization of state level firearm carry legislation over the last 30 years and the rates of homicides or other violent crime. 105 This is also in line with a 1997 study researching countylevel data from 1977 to 1992 concluding that allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes and it appears to produce no increase in accidental deaths. 106 A 2018 study in The Review of Economics and Statistics found that the impact of righttocarry laws was mixed and changed over time. RTC laws increased some crimes over some periods while decreasing other crimes over other periods. The study suggested that conclusions drawn in other studies are highly dependent on the time periods that are studied the types of models that are adopted and the assumptions that are made. 107 A 2015 study that looked at issuance rates of concealedcarry permits and changes in violent crime by countylevel in four shallissue states found no increases or decreases in violent crime rates with changes in permit issuances. 108 109 A 2019 study in the International Review of Law and Economics found that with one method righttocarry laws had no impact on violent crime but with another method led to an increase in violent crime neither method showed that righttocarry laws led to a reduction in crime. 110 A 2003 study found no significant changes in violent crime rates amongst 58 Florida counties with increases of concealedcarry permits. 111 A 2004 study found no significant association between homicide rates and shallissue concealed carry laws. 112  A 2013 study of eight years of Texas data found that concealed handgun licensees were much less likely to be convicted of crimes than were nonlicensees. The same study found that licensees convictions were more likely to be for less common crimes such as sexual offenses gun offenses or offenses involving a death. 113 A 2020 study in Applied Economics Letters examining concealedcarry permits per capita by state found a significant negative effect on violent crime rates. 114 A 2016 study found a significant negative effect on violent crime rates with passage of shallissue laws. 115 A 2017 study in Applied Economics Letters found that property crime decreased in Chicago after the implementation of the shall issue concealed carry law. 116 A 2014 Applied Economics Letters study found states with more permissive conceal carry laws had lower murder rates than states with restrictive laws. 117 Another 2014 study found that RTC laws by state significantly reduce homicide rates. 118  In 1996 economists John R. Lott Jr. and David B. Mustard analyzed crime data in all 3054 counties in the United States from 1977 to 1992 finding counties that had shallissue licensing laws overall saw murders decrease by 7.65 percent rapes decrease by 5.2 percent aggravated assaults decrease by 7 percent and robberies decrease by 2.2 percent. 119 The study was widely disputed by numerous economists. The 2004 National Academy of Sciences panel reviewing the research on the subject concluded with one dissenting panelist that the Lott and Mustard study was unreliable. 120 Georgetown University Professor Jens Ludwig Daniel Nagin of Carnegie Mellon University and Dan A. Black of the University of Chicago in The Journal of Legal Studies said of the LottMustard study once Florida is removed from the sample there is no longer any detectable impact of righttocarry laws on the rates of murder and rape. 121  A 2022 study examining the Sullivan Act of 1911 found that the law had no impact on overall homicide rates reduced overall suicide rates and caused large and sustained decrease in gunrelated suicide rates. 122  In 2016 FBI analyzed 40 active shooter incidents in 2014 and 2015 where bystanders were put in peril in ongoing incidents that could be affected by police or citizen response. Six incidents were successfully ended when citizens intervened. In two stops citizens restrained the shooters one unarmed one with pepper spray. In two stops at schools the shooters were confronted by teachers one shooter disarmed and one committed suicide. In two stops citizens with firearms permits exchanged gunfire with the shooter. In a failed stop attempt a citizen with a firearms permit was killed by the shooter. 123 In 2018 the FBI analyzed 50 active shooter incidents in 2016 and 2017. This report focused on policies to neutralize active shooters to save lives. In 10 incidents citizens confronted an active shooter. In eight incidents the citizens stopped the shooter. Four stops involved unarmed citizens who confronted and restrained or blocked the shooter or talked the shooter into surrendering. Four stops involved citizens with firearms permits two exchanged gunfire with a shooter and two detained the shooter at gunpoint for arrest by responding police. Of the two failed stops one involved a permit holder who exchanged gunfire with the shooter but the shooter fled and continued shooting and the other involved a permit holder who was wounded by the shooter. Armed and unarmed citizens engaged the shooter in 10 incidents. They safely and successfully ended the shootings in eight of those incidents. Their selfless actions likely saved many lives. 124 
https://www.nraila.org/get-the-facts/right-to-carry-and-concealed-carry/, Today 42 states accounting for 74 percent of the U.S. population have RighttoCarry RTC laws. Legislation introduced in Congress would require states to honor each other s carry permits.  Gun control supporters believe that RTC laws cause crime. However since 1991 when violent crime hit an alltime high 25 states have adopted RTC laws the number of people with carry permits has risen to over 16 million and the nation s violent crime rate has decreased to one of the lowest points in recent history. RighttoCarry RTC laws recognize the right to carry concealed handguns when away from home without a permit or with a permit issued by a state to an applicant who meets requirements established by the state legislature. The laws expand upon the right recognized in most states to carry handguns openly without a permit. RTC laws are consistent with the constitutions of the United States and 44 states the laws of all states and the common law all of which recognize the right to use firearms in selfdefense. RTC laws are essential because selfdefense is a fundamental right.2 In District of Columbia v. Heller 2008 the Supreme Court ruled that the inherent right of selfdefense has been central to the Second Amendment right which is the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of confrontation. This meaning is strongly confirmed by the historical background of the Second Amendment. 3 Also while law enforcement personnel provide protection generally they are not required to protect individuals.4 There are 42 RTC states accounting for about threequarters of the U.S. population. Forty of these states and the District of Columbia have shall issue laws requiring that concealed carry permits be issued to qualified applicants.5 16 states including 15 of the 40 shall issue states allow concealed carrying without a permit.6 In 2014 Guam became a shallissue jurisdiction.7 Eight states Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands have restrictivelyadministered discretionaryissue carry permit systems.8 As the numbers of RTC states and carry permitholders have increased violent crime has decreased. Since 1991 when violent crime hit an alltime high 26 states have adopted shall issue laws replacing laws that prohibited the carrying of concealed firearms or that issued concealed carry permits on a very limited basis.9 Concurrently the number of carry permitholders has risen to over 16 million10 many other federal state and local gun control laws have been eliminated or made less restrictive11 and the number of privatelyowned guns has risen by over 150 million.12 At the same time through 2015 the nation s total violent crime rate and especially the murder rate has decreased to a near alltime low.13 Americans support gun ownership for defensive purposes. In 2014 the Pew Research Center found that 57 percent of Americans believe that gun ownership protects people from crime while only 38 percent disagree and that support for the majority viewpoint is increasing among men women whites blacks all Republicans conservative Republicans Independents and conservative and moderate Democrats.14 The poll also found that support for protecting rather than restricting gun ownership increased among men women all age groups persons of all levels of education all Republicans conservative Republicans Independents all Democrats conservative and moderate Democrats parents nonparents urbanites suburbanites and rural dwellers. In 2013 Gallup found that personal safety is the top reason Americans own guns.15 Gun control supporters oppose the use of firearms for selfdefense. The Brady Campaign a gun control activist group has said the only reason for guns in civilian hands is for sporting purposes violent crime criminals should put up no defense give them criminals what they want and selfdefense is not a federally guaranteed constitutional right. 16 Congressional legislation proposes national RTC reciprocity. Legislation introduced in Congress would require states to recognize each other s carry permits just as they do for stateissued driver s licenses. Before 1987 there were 10 RTC states six of which had shall issue concealed carry permit laws two of which had fairlyadministered discretionaryissue carry permit laws one of which was varyingly interpreted within the state and one of which did not require a permit to carry openly or concealed.17 In 1987 Florida enacted a shall issue RTC law that became the model for similar laws thereafter adopted in 33 other states.18 Gun control supporters predicted that Florida s law would cause crime to rise. However within five years Florida s murder rate had decreased 23 percent while the U.S. rate had risen nine percent.19  In 1995 antigun researcher David McDowell tried to fault Florida s law claiming that gun homicide rates increased in Miami Jacksonville and Tampa after the law s adoption.20 However homicide rates had fallen 10 18 and 20 percent respectively in those metropolitan areas from 1987 until 1993 the most recent data at the time.21 To show an increase McDowell calculated Jacksonville and Tampa trends from the early 1970s when rates were lower than in 1993 but calculated Miami s from 1983 since earlier rates were higher and suggested crime had decreased. None of the homicides noted by McDowell was committed by a carry permit holder and he didn t indicate whether any of the homicides had occurred in a situation in which a permit would have been required to carry a gun. McDowell once claimed D.C. s murder rate decreased after its 1977 handgun ban in fact the rate tripled.22 Florida officials had a different view than gun control supporters about Florida s RTC law. Florida Licensing Division Director John Russi noted Florida s concealed weapon law has been very successful. All major law enforcement groups supported the original legislation....Some of the opponents of concealed weapon legislation in 1987 now admit the program has not created the problems many predicted. 23 In a 1995 letter to state officials Florida s Department of Law Enforcement Commissioner James T. Moore wrote From a law enforcement perspective the licensing process has not resulted in problems. 24 After Florida as states adopted RTC legislation one after another gun control supporters continued to predict that crime would rise but the predictions have proven false. Attorney and law professor David Kopel has noted Whenever a state legislature first considers a concealed carry bill opponents typically warn of horrible consequences....But within a year of passage the issue usually drops off the news media s radar screen while guncontrol advocates in the legislature conclude that the law wasn t so bad after all. 25 An article on Michigan s concealed carrying licensing law noted Concerns that permit holders would lose their tempers in traffic accidents have been unfounded. Worries about risks to police officers have also proved unfounded.... National surveys of police show they support concealed handgun laws by a 31 margin....There is also not a single academic study that claims Right to Carry laws have increased state crime rates. The debate among academics has been over how large the benefits have been. 26 Antigun groups have portrayed carry permitholders as criminals but permitholders are more lawabiding than the general public. This is best indicated by the experience of Florida the state that has issued the most permits due to its relatively early date of RTC adoption relatively large population and relatively large rate of gun ownership. As of June 2014 Florida had issued 2.7 million carry permits but revoked only 168 0.006 percent due to gun crimes by permitholders.27 LottMustard study Studying crime trends in every county in the U.S. economist John Lott and David Mustard concluded allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent crimes. . . . When state concealed handgun laws went into effect in a county murders fell by 8.5 percent and rapes and aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent. 28 Kleck and KleckGertz studies Analyzing National Crime Victimization Survey data criminologist Gary Kleck concluded robbery and assault victims who used a gun to resist were less likely to be attacked or to suffer an injury than those who used any other methods of selfprotection or those who did not resist at all. 29 In the 1990s when violent crime rates were much higher Kleck and Marc Gertz found guns were used for selfprotection between 2.12.5 million times annually.30 Gun control activists claim the KleckGertz study is flawed. Nevertheless the late Marvin E. Wolfgang who professed to be as strong a guncontrol advocate as can be found among the criminologists in this country stated The methodological soundness of the current Kleck and Gertz study is clear. I cannot further debate it. . . . I cannot fault their methodology. 31 An earlier study for the Justice Department found 34 percent of felons had been scared off shot at wounded or captured by an armed victim and 40 percent had not committed crimes fearing victims were armed.32 Antigun activist group claims In 1999 the Brady Campaign then known as Handgun Control Inc. claimed that between 1991 and 1997 violent crime declined less in RTC states than in other states.33 HCI incorrectly categorized 31 states as having RTC during the period only 17 had RTC in 1992. HCI calculated crime trends from 1992 to underrepresent the impact of RTC laws. By 1992 many states had had RTC for many years and had already experienced decreases in crime. HCI misclassified Alabama and Connecticut as restrictive and credited restrictive laws for crime decreasing in some states. States that had restrictive laws had had them for many years however and crime did not begin declining in those states until the 1990s when crime decreased nationally.34 In 1998 the Violence Policy Center led by a handgun prohibition activist previously with the National Coalition to Ban Handguns claimed more women are murdered with handguns than criminals killed in selfdefense.35 However the value of handguns for selfdefense is not in how many criminals are killed but in how often people use handguns to prevent crimes and how often criminals don t attack fearing potential victims are armed. VPC also undercounted the number of criminals killed in selfdefense by counting only those noted in police reports thus excluding defensive homicides later determined to have been justified. VPC claims that permitholders have committed crimes but those listed by the group have mostly been crimes not involving guns crimes committed with guns for which a permit was not required crimes committed in locations in which a permit was not required to possess a firearm and instances in which no crime was committed. 1. The states that don t have constitutional provisions protecting the right to keep and bear arms are California Iowa Maryland Minnesota New Jersey and New York. 2. In addition to the Supreme Court s decision in District of Columbia v. Heller see note 3 in Beard v. U.S. 1895 the Court approved the commonlaw rule that a person may without retreating repel force by force in selfdefense. The Court reaffirmed that view in Brown v. U.S. 1921. Also the right to selfdefense has been recognized for centuries. Cicero said 2000 years ago If our lives are endangered by plots or violence or armed robbers or enemies any and every method of protecting ourselves is morally right. English jurist Sir William Blackstone observed that the English Bill of Rights recognized the right of having and using arms for selfpreservation and defense in order to protect and maintain inviolate the three great and primary rights the first of which is personal security. Stephen P. Halbrook That Every Man Be Armed The Independent Institute 1994 pp. 17 54. Sir Michael Foster judge of the Court of King s Bench wrote in the 18th century The right of selfdefense . . . is founded in the law of nature and is not nor can be superseded by any law of society.

Winnebago County Dept. of Social Services 1988 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled a State s failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause. This was true in that case even though the state had purported to intervene against abuse being suffered by the victim but later returned the victim to the abusive environment. In Warren v. District of Columbia 1981 the D.C. Court of Appeals ruled police personnel and the government employing them are not generally liable to victims of criminal acts for failure to provide adequate police protection . . . . A government and its agents are under no general duty to provide public services such as police protection to any particular citizen. In Bowers v. DeVito 1982 the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals ruled There is no constitutional right to be protected by the state against being murdered by criminals or madmen.  5.

https://concealedguns.procon.org/, Proponents of concealed carry say concealed carry deters crime keeps individuals and the public safer is protected by the Second Amendment and protect women and minorities who can t always rely on the police for protection. Opponents of concealed carry say concealed carry increases crime increases the chances of a confrontation becoming lethal is not protected by the Second Amendment and that public safety should be left to professionally qualified police officers. Read more background  In a landmark study that analyzed FBI crime data John R. Lott Jr. PhD found that states that implemented shallissue concealed carry laws reduced murders by 8.5 rapes by 5 aggravated assaults by 7 and robberies by 3. Lott calculated that 1570 murders 4177 rapes 60000 aggravated assaults and 12000 robberies could have been prevented between 1977 and 1992 if concealed carry had been legal in every US state during that time period. 8 John Malcolm JD Vice President of the Institute for Constitutional Government and Amy Swearer JD Visiting Legal Fellow at the Meese Center for Legal and Judicial Studies stated Between 2007 and 2015 murder rates dropped 16 percent and violent crime rates dropped 18 percent even though the percentage of adults with concealed carry permits rose by 190 percent. They continued Regression estimates show a significant association between increased permit ownership and a drop in murder and violent crime rates. Each percentage point increase in rates of permitholding is associated with a roughly 2.5 percent drop in the murder rate. 92 Larry Keane JD Senior Vice President for Government Public Affairs for the National Shooting Sports Foundation stated Although the news stories rarely get coverage beyond their immediate media market individuals with legally concealed carry firearms have successfully protected themselves and have come to the assistance of their fellow citizens on numerous occasions. They have also aided law enforcement officers who were in grave danger. As the number of permits holders has risen there has not been a Wild West of reckless gunfire that the antigun activists have long predicted. 95 According to Amy Swearer JD Legal Fellow at the Meese Center and Cooper Conway a member of the Young Leaders Program at The Heritage Foundation Americans defend themselves with their firearms between 500000 and 3 million times every year. It s unclear how many of these defensive gun uses involve concealedcarry permit holders carrying in public places but our own records show that concealedcarry permit holders can and do save lives. They continue Moreover concealedcarry permit holders have intervened to stop many scenarios that likely would have turned into mass killings but for their actions. 96 The Second Amendment states a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. 53  The federal 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in the Dec. 11 2012 case Moore v. Madigan ruled that the Second Amendment s right to bear arms must be interpreted to include a right to have a concealed gun in public to have it ready for use and to have it for selfdefense. 55  The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Hawaii s restrictive carry policies in July 2018. The ruling stated We do not take lightly the problem of gun violence. But for better or for worse the Second Amendment does protect a right to carry a firearm in public for selfdefense. 98 Joseph Greenlee JD Director of Research at the Firearms Policy Coalition explained The Supreme Court has elucidated that the scope of the Second Amendment is defined by the foundingera understanding of the right as informed by American history and tradition. A historical analysis shows that both concealed and open carry are protected by the right and that a government may only restrict one if the other remains available for lawabiding citizens to exercise. 99 David French senior writer at the National Review and a veteran of the Iraq War explained when you concealed carry your weapon you don t feel intimidated you feel empowered. In a way that s tough to explain the fact that you re so much less dependent on the state for your personal security and safety makes you feel more free than you ve ever felt before. 100 John R. Lott Jr. PhD found that between 2012 and 2018 the percent of women with permits grew 111 faster for women and the percent of blacks with permits grew 20 faster than for whites. Permits for Asians grew 29 faster than for whites. 101 Women who have been victimized as adults were more likely to own a gun more likely to own more than one gun and more likely to carry a gun for protection. 102 According to Pew Research women are slightly more likely to report owning a gun for protection 71 to 65 but men report owning guns for more activities hunting sports shooting etc and men report owning more types of guns shotguns and rifles rather than just a handgun than women so women are more likely to own handguns only for protection. 103 Jim Curcuruto Director of Research and Market Development at the National Shooting Sports Foundation said of the increase in gun sales during the 2020 civil rights movement The highest overall firearm sales increase comes from Black men and women who show a 58.2 increase in purchases during the first six months of 2020 versus the same period last year 104 As Bruce Tomlin a Black gun owner explained to NPR I just feel like in my viewpoint every Black person in America especially Black males needs to have some type of protection with them as often as they can because I think the political climate is getting to the point where it s just going to be a lot of violence coming our way. I just feel safer now having a gun. And I didn t always feel that way. I ve never been the world s biggest fan of guns but I just don t feel safe without one I d rather go to trial than go to the cemetery 105 A 2018 study conducted by the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded There is not even the slightest hint in the data that RTC righttocarry laws reduce violent crime. Indeed the weight of the evidence from the panel data estimates as well as the synthetic control analysis best supports the view that the adoption of RTC laws substantially raises overall violent crime in the ten years after adoption. The authors found Ten years after the adoption of RTC laws violent crime is estimated to be 13 percent to 15 percent higher than it would have been without the RTC law. 93 94 A 1995 study of five urban cities published in the Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology concluded that gun homicide rates increased on average by 4.5 per 100000 persons following the enactment of shallissue laws. 12  A May 2009 study found that shallissue laws were associated with increased numbers of aggravated assaults between 1977 and 2006. 33  Former Los Angeles Police Department Chief Charlie Beck said I have seen far too much gun violence in my lifetime to think that more guns is a solution a gun is more likely to be used against you than you use a gun in selfdefense. 83 According to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence members of the public who carry guns risk escalating everyday disagreements into public shootouts especially in places where disputes frequently occur in bars at sporting events or in traffic. 67  For example on Jan 13 2014 a retired police officer with a legally concealed handgun shot and killed another man during an argument over text messaging in a movie theater. 84 John J. Donohue III JD Professor of Law at Stanford University explained For example the Philando Castile case in St. Paul Minnesota. After he was stopped by police he immediately told the officer that he was a righttocarry holder and had a gun which you re advised to do. And then the officer shot at him seven times. It scares the hell out of people when they think someone has a gun. Obviously that righttocarry holder wasn t doing anything wrong but he ended up getting killed anyway. When more people are carrying guns things can get more heated. There are times in which the gun could be involved in a way that thwarts a crime but for the same reason that the officer shot Castile guns tend to escalate the situation. 94 The Second Amendment states a well regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed. 53  There is no mention of concealed guns in the Constitution or Bill of Rights. 71 US Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in the court s majority opinion in DC v. Heller Like most rights the right secured by the Second Amendment is not unlimited the majority of the 19thcentury courts to consider the question held that prohibitions on carrying concealed weapons were lawful under the Second Amendment. 70 In May 2014 the US Supreme Court declined to hear Drake v.
