https://www.imf.org/en/Blogs/Articles/2017/09/01/the-benefits-and-costs-of-a-u-s-tax-cut, Versions in Espa ol Spanish U.S. lawmakers getting ready to rewrite the nation s tax code have a fundamental question to answer What are the priorities for tax reform? Do you want faster growth? Less income inequality? A tax cut that doesn t increase the budget deficit? In a recent working paper we find that depending on how a tax cut is targeted it is possible to make some progress toward the first two objectives. Personal income tax cuts can help support growth and if well targeted can also help improve income distribution. However we find that lowering personal income tax rates does not raise growth enough to offset the revenue loss that is caused by the tax cut itself. The tax reform debate is unfolding with the U.S. economy in one of its longest expansions in history. In the medium term though growth prospects are constrained by weak productivity growth falling labor force participation increasingly polarized income distribution and high levels of poverty. These trends have reduced the labor share of national income by about 5 percent in 15 years have shrunk the middle class to the smallest share of the population in 30 years and aside from the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis have resulted in the lowest potential growth rate since the 1940s. Finding solutions to these issues requires action in multiple areas among them trade education and health. In the latest economic assessment of the U.S. economy the IMF and U.S. authorities have also mentioned tax policy as an important lever. Our paper looks more closely at the notion that tax reforms and individual income tax cuts in particular can go a long way in solving these challenges. But how far can a tax cut really take you? Can a personal income tax cut boost growth? And if it does can it boost it enough to not weigh on the budget? More importantly will the benefits of the reform reach low and middleincome households? Our paper assesses the dynamic effects of lowering effective personal income tax rates on income distribution and the U.S. economy. We do so based on modern tools for quantitative macroeconomic analysis relying on a model capturing salient features of the United States that are key for the question at hand namely different types of households differentiated by education level different productive sectors manufacturing and services interlinked through a realistic inputoutput structure and international trade. In addition and contrary to standard incidence analyses our approach incorporates dynamics and forward looking behavior which allows us to consider the mediumterm effects of policy changes. Three key results emerge from our analysis.  First although we find that tax cuts provide a onetime boost to GDP consumption and investment these effects are never strong enough to prevent a loss of revenue. Thus tax cuts would need to be financed either through increasing the public debt cutting spending or by raising revenues from other taxes. Since we aim at obtaining better distributional outcomes while still preserving some modest upside to growth we focus on financing the cuts with a shift from personal income taxes to consumption taxes combined with an expansion of the earned income tax credit to protect the poor.  Second we find that personal income tax cuts can benefit lower income groups even if those at the bottom of the earnings scale do not directly receive a tax cut. Our economic model predicts that when tax cuts are targeted at middle or high income groups these groups will spend some of the tax savings on nontradable services which are typically provided by lowerincome people. Wealthier groups on average dedicate a larger share of their consumption expenditures to services. Consequently when wealthier people pay less in taxes their spending on services increases raising demand for and the wages of lowskilled labor.  Third our analysis reveals a fundamental tradeoff between growth and income inequality depending on who gets the tax cut. In our simulations while tax cuts for higher income groups may generate greater gains in GDP through higher investment and labor supply they also exacerbate income polarization and inequality both already at historical highs. Even accounting for the fact that rich people might consume more goods and services produced by people in the lower part of the income distribution and allowing for an increase in the earned income tax credit to protect the poor the income gap would still widen substantially if taxes were cut for higher income groups. On the other hand a tax cut targeted at middleincome groups would help reduce income disparity and polarization but might provide smaller growth dividends.

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/07/tax_cuts.asp,  The federal tax system relies on several taxes to generate revenue. By far the largest source of funds is income tax. In 2022 the Internal Revenue Service IRS collected a net 2.9 trillion in individual estate and trust income taxes or 59.2 of the total.  Personal income taxes are levied against wages interest dividends and capital gains and ordinary income rates are marginal based on income.  The employment taxes that fund Social Security benefits and Medicare are the next largest source of national revenue. The IRS collected a net 1.4 trillion in employment taxes in 2022 or 28.9 of the total. The employment tax is a fixed percentage levied on salaries and wages and is paid equally by both employer and employee.  The corporate tax contributed 9.7 475.9 billion to national coffers and the excise tax levied against items such as gasoline and tobacco contributed 1.4 70.7 billion.  Source IRS   The federal government uses tax policy to generate revenue and generally aims to burden those taxpayers who will be the least affected often the wealthy however the flypaper theory of taxation which assumes the burdens of the tax stick to where the government places the tax often proves to be incorrect and tax shifting occurs.  Tax shifting is an economic phenomenon in which the taxpayer transfers the tax burden to the purchaser or supplier by increasing the sales price or depressing the purchase price during the process of commodity exchange.  Additionally shifting tax burdens have been evident through tax cuts for the wealthy that may not have any significant effect on economic growth and unemployment and lead to higher income inequality according to a 2022 study of 18 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD including the United States.  Since the 1980s policies in countries like the United States have often been based on arguments that higher taxes on the wealthy have a negative influence on economic growth.   Reducing marginal tax rates to spur economic growth is a commonly used policy with the notion that lower tax rates will give people more aftertax income that could be used to buy more goods and services.  This is a demandside argument to support a tax reduction as an expansionary measure. Further reduced tax rates may boost savings and investment leading to further production and reduced unemployment.  Lowering taxes raises disposable income allowing the consumer to spend more which increases the gross domestic product GDP. Consumer spending typically constitutes twothirds of GDP and was 68 of GDP as of Q2 2023.  Supplyside tax cuts are aimed to stimulate capital formation. If successful the cuts will shift both aggregate demand and aggregate supply because the price level for a supply of goods will be reduced which often leads to an increase in demand for those goods.  The National Bureau of Economic Research studies the persistent effects of temporary changes in U.S. federal corporate and personal income tax rates. According to their recent 2022 working paper a corporate income tax cut leads to a sustained increase in GDP and productivity. In contrast personal income tax cuts trigger a shortlived boost to GDP productivity and hours worked but have no longterm effects. Two distinct concepts of taxation are horizontal equity and vertical equity. Horizontal equity is the idea that all individuals should be taxed equally. Vertical equity is the abilitytopay principle where those who are most able to pay are assessed higher taxes. Tax cuts affect individuals differently because of the progressive nature of the tax. Reducing taxes on a family with a small adjusted gross income AGI will save them less in total dollar amounts than a slightly smaller tax cut on a family with a much higher salary. Acrosstheboard cuts will benefit high earners more in a dollar sense simply because of their higher earnings. Gross national product GNP is the total value of all finished goods and services produced by citizens and the output generated by businesses. Tax cuts increase available funding to individuals and businesses and may increase production and investment.  Tax cuts reduce government revenues and create either a budget deficit or increased sovereign debt. Critics often argue that tax cuts benefit the rich at the expense of those with fewer resources as services beneficial to those in a lower income bracket are cut. Proponents claim that cuts put money in consumers pockets resulting in spending increases which grow the economy. Internal Revenue Service. 2022 Data Book Page 3. Internal Revenue Service.

https://www.brookings.edu/articles/effects-of-income-tax-changes-on-economic-growth/,  WilliamGale2  UrbanBrookings Tax Policy Center This paper examines how changes to the individual income tax affect longterm economic growth. The structure and financing of a tax change are critical to achieving economic growth. Tax rate cuts may encourage individuals to work save and invest but if the tax cuts are not financed by immediate spending cuts they will likely also result in an increased federal budget deficit which in the longterm will reduce national saving and raise interest rates. The net impact on growth is uncertain but many estimates suggest it is either small or negative. Basebroadening measures can eliminate the effect of tax rate cuts on budget deficits but at the same time they reduce the impact on labor supply saving and investment and thus reduce the direct impact on growth. They may also reallocate resources across sectors toward their highestvalue economic use resulting in increased efficiency and potentially raising the overall size of the economy. Results in the literature suggest that not all tax changes will have the same impact on growth. Reforms that improve incentives reduce existing distortionary subsidies avoid windfall gains and avoid deficit financing will have more auspicious effects on the longterm size of the economy but may also create tradeoffs between equity and efficiency. Policy makers and researchers have long been interested in how potential changes to the personal income tax system affect the size of the overall economy. In 2014 for example Representative Dave Camp RMI proposed a sweeping reform to the income tax system that would reduce rates greatly pare back subsidies in the tax code and maintain revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens across income classes Committee on Ways and Means 2014. In this paper we focus on how tax changes affect economic growth. We focus on two types of tax changes reductions in individual income tax rates and income tax reform. We define the latter as changes that broaden the income tax base and reduce statutory income tax rates but nonetheless maintain the overall revenue levels and the distribution of tax burdens implied by the current income system. Our focus is on individual income tax reform leaving consideration of reforms to the corporate income tax for which see Toder and Viard 2014 and reforms that focus on consumption taxes for other analyses. By economic growth we mean expansion of the supply side of the economy and of potential Gross Domestic Product GDP. This expansion could be an increase in the annual growth rate a onetime increase in the size of the economy that does not affect the future growth rate but puts the economy on a higher growth path or both. Our focus on the supply side of the economy in the long run is in contrast to the shortterm phenomenon also called economic growth by which a boost in aggregate demand in a slack economy can raise GDP and help align actual GDP with potential GDP. The importance of the topics addressed here derive from the income tax s central role in revenue generation its impact on the distribution of aftertax income and its effects on a wide variety of economic activities. The importance is only heightened by concerns about the longterm economic growth rate Gordon 2016 Summers 2014 and concerns about the longterm fiscal status of the federal government Auerbach and Gale 2016. We find that while there is no doubt that tax policy can influence economic choices it is by no means obvious on an ex ante basis that tax rate cuts will ultimately lead to a larger economy in the long run. While rate cuts would raise the aftertax return to working saving and investing they would also raise the aftertax income people receive from their current level of activities which lessens their need to work save and invest. The first effect normally raises economic activity through socalled substitution effects while the second effect normally reduces it through socalled income effects. The financing of tax cuts significantly affects its impact on longterm growth. Tax cuts financed by immediate cuts in unproductive government spending could raise output but tax cuts financed by reductions in government investment could reduce output. If they are not financed by spending cuts tax cuts will lead to an increase in federal borrowing which in turn will reduce longterm growth. The historical evidence and simulation analyses suggest that tax cuts that are financed by debt for an extended period of time will have little positive impact on longterm growth and could reduce growth. Tax reform is more complex as it involves tax rate cuts as well as basebroadening changes. There is a theoretical presumption that such changes should raise the overall size of the economy in the longterm though the effect and magnitude of the impact are subject to considerable uncertainty. One fact that often escapes unnoticed is that broadening the tax base by reducing or eliminating tax expenditures raises the effective tax rate that people and firms face and hence will operate in that regard in a direction opposite to rate cuts and mitigate their effects on economic growth. But basebroadening has the additional benefit of reallocating resources from sectors that are currently taxpreferred to sectors that have the highest economic pretax return which should increase the overall size of the economy. A fair assessment would conclude that welldesigned tax policies have the potential to raise economic growth but there are many stumbling blocks along the way and certainly no guarantee that all tax changes will improve economic performance. Given the various channels through which tax policy affects growth a tax change will be more growthinducing to the extent that it involves i large positive incentive substitution effects that encourage work saving and investment ii small or negative income effects including a careful targeting of tax cuts toward new economic activity rather than providing windfall gains for previous activities iii reductions in distortions across economic sectors and across different types of income and consumption and iv minimal increases in or reductions in the budget deficit. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II provides a conceptual framework by discussing the channels through which tax changes can affect economic performance including the many ways in which a positive substitution effect in response to a tax rate cut might be dissipated or even reversed by other factors. Section III provides an empirical starting point. We show that growth rates over long periods of time in the United States have not changed in tandem with the massive changes in the structure and revenue yield of the tax system that have occurred. We also report findings from Piketty Saez and Stantcheva 2014 that across advanced countries even large changes in the top marginal income tax rate over time do not appear to be strongly correlated with rates of growth. Section IV explores empirical evidence on taxes and growth from studies of major income tax changes in the United States. Consistent with the discussion in Section III the studies find little evidence that tax cuts or tax reform since 1980 have impacted the longterm growth rate significantly. Section V examines the new narrative approach to identifying tax changes that are exogenous to current economic conditions stemming from the seminal work of Romer and Romer 2010. The literature which generally uses vector autoregression VAR models finds that tax cuts that meet the exogeneity criteria raise shortterm output and other economic activity. The narrative literature does not speak to the longterm effects though. Section VI discusses the results from the literature on simulation models which has generated two main results. First debtfinanced tax cuts will tend to boost shortterm growth as in standard Keynesian models and in the literature using the narrative approach but also tend to reduce longterm growth if they are financed eventually by higher taxes. Second revenueneutral income tax reform can provide a modest boost to economic growth. 1 There are a number of related issues that are both interesting and important but beyond the scope of the paper including for example the elasticity of taxable income the relationship between inequality especially as it is affected by the tax system and growth the effects of corporate income tax reform on growth and the detailed literatures on the effects of taxes on labor supply saving and investment.

The President s plan delivers tax cuts for families with children and working Americans invests in America and reduces deficits by trillions of dollars by enacting a new billionaire minimum tax and cracking down on multinational companies shifting jobs and profits overseas.Since taking office President Biden has fought to build a fairer tax system that rewards work not wealth asks big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share and requires all Americans to play by the same rules and pay the taxes they owe. Despite Republican opposition President Biden secured historic legislation to make our tax code fairer from enacting a 15 corporate minimum tax so that billiondollar companies can t get away with paying 0 in federal income taxes to giving the Internal Revenue Service IRS the tools it needs to make wealthy tax cheats pay the taxes they owe.President Biden will fight to stop Republican plans to add trillions to the deficit with tax cuts skewed to big corporations and the wealthy doubling down on their failed trickledown tax cuts that already increased the nation s debt by trillions of dollars. Republicans have proposed making all of President Trump s tax cuts permanent while refusing to pay for them by increasing taxes on big corporations or the wealthy. Instead they would rather add trillions to the national debt than take back even one dollar of the 150 billion annual rate cut corporations received under President Trump. Their plan would add more than 3 trillion to deficits over 10 years while providing tax cuts worth 175000 per year to the top 0.1 percent of Americans that have incomes over 4.5 million. President Biden supports continuing tax cuts for families making less than 400000 but opposes extending tax cuts or restoring tax breaks for those making more than 400000 per year. And he believes that any extensions should be paid for by asking big corporations and the wealthy to pay their fair share.While big corporations and the wealthy will pay more in taxes under President Biden s policies President Biden opposes tax increases on middleclass families. He has pledged that under his Administration no one earning less than 400000 will pay an additional penny in federal taxes not one penny.Making Big Corporations Pay Their Fair SharePresident Biden has secured major reforms to crack down on big corporations paying little or nothing in taxes and on stock buybacks that provide large lowtax payouts to wealthy investors and CEOs. President Biden s tax plan would build on this progress by finally making big corporations pay their fair share in taxes Making the Wealthy Pay Their Fair SharePresident Biden has already secured funding for the Internal Revenue Service IRS that is enabling it to crack down on wealthy and big business tax cheats. The IRS has used this funding to collect more than 500 million in unpaid taxes from fewer than 2000 delinquent millionaires launch enforcement action against 25000 millionaires who have not filed a tax return since 2017 and crack down on highend tax evasion like deducting personal use of corporate jets as a business expense. In total the IRS is projected to collect hundreds of billions of dollars in additional revenue over the next decade thanks to this investment. President Biden s tax plan would build on this progress with reforms that will finally make the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share Cutting Taxes for Working Families and the Middle ClassPresident Biden s tax cuts cut child poverty in half in 2021 and are saving millions of people an average of about 800 per year in health insurance premiums today. Going forward in addition to honoring his pledge not to raise taxes on families earning less than 400000 annually President Biden s tax plan would cut taxes for middle and lowincome Americans by 765 billion over 10 years including by In addition President Biden s plan will extend all middleclass tax cuts as the President has repeatedly promised he will not raise taxes on anyone making less than 400000 per year. He will fully pay for these extensions with additional reforms to make the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share so that they do not add to the debt. And he opposes extending tax cuts or restoring tax breaks for those making more than 400000 per year.The Congressional Republican Plan Adding Trillions to Deficits With Tax Cuts Skewed to the Wealthy and Big CorporationsRepublicans are working to make all of former President Trump s tax cuts permanent adding more than 3 trillion to the debt over the next 10 years with unpaidfor tax cuts that are skewed to the wealthy and large corporations.

https://taxfoundation.org/research/all/federal/benefits-of-a-corporate-tax-cut/, Before the TCJA the United States had the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD countries at 38.9 percent federal plus the average of state corporate income tax rates. The TCJA reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9 percent to 25.7 percent and placing the U.S. nearer to the OECD average. A permanently lower federal corporate income tax rate will lead to several positive economic effects. The benefits of a lower rate include encouraging investment in the United States and discouraging profit shifting. As additional investment grows the capital stock the demand for labor to work with the new capital will increase leading to higher productivity output employment and wages over time.

Under a neoclassical economic view the main drivers of economic output are the willingness of people to work more and to deploy capital such as machines equipment factories etc.1 Taxes play a role in these decisions specifically the corporate income tax rate is an important determinant in how much people are willing to invest in new capital and in where they will place that new capital. Evidence shows that of the different types of taxes the corporate income tax is the most harmful for economic growth.2 One key reason that capital is so sensitive to taxation is because capital is highly mobile. For example it is relatively easy for a company to move its operations or choose to locate its next investment in a lowertax jurisdiction but it is more difficult for a worker to move his or her family to get a lower tax bill. This means capital is very responsive to tax changes lowering the corporate income tax rate reduces the amount of economic harm it causes. A common misunderstanding is that corporations bear the cost of the corporate income tax. However a growing body of economic literature indicates that the true burden of the corporate income is split between workers through lower wages and owners of the corporation.3 As capital moves away in response to high statutory corporate income tax rates productivity and wages for the relatively immobile workers fall. Empirical studies show that labor bears between 50 and 100 percent of the burden of the corporate income tax.4 In the long run it is split evenly by both capital and labor.5 To understand why the lower corporate tax rate drives growth in capital stock wages jobs and the overall size of the economy it is important to understand how the corporate income tax rate affects economic decisions. When firms think about making an investment in a new capital good like a piece of equipment they add up all the costs of doing so including taxes and weigh those costs against the expected revenue the capital will generate. The higher the tax the higher the cost of capital the less capital that can be created and employed.6 So a higher corporate income tax rate reduces the longrun capital stock and reduces the longrun size of the economy.7 Conversely lowering the corporate income tax incentivizes new investment leading to an increase of the capital stock.  Capital formation which results from investment is the major force for raising incomes across the board.8 More capital for workers boosts productivity and productivity is a large determinant of wages and other forms of compensation. This happens because as businesses invest in additional capital the demand for labor to work with the capital rises and wages rise too.9 It is because of these economic effects that of all the permanent elements considered during the tax reform debates reducing the corporate tax rate was the most progrowth.10 The last time the United States reduced the federal corporate income tax was in 1986 but since then countries throughout the world significantly reduced their statutory rates. From 1980 to 2017 the worldwide corporate tax rate declined from an average of 38 percent to about 23 percent.11 Over this period the United States maintained a comparatively high and uncompetitive corporate income tax rate.  Subscribe to get insights from our trusted experts delivered straight to your inbox. Of 202 jurisdictions surveyed in 2017 the United States had the fourth highest statutory corporate income tax rate.12 And among OECD nations the United States had the highest combined statutory corporate income tax rate at 38.9 percent.13 This was approximately 15 percentage points higher than the OECD average excluding the United States at 23.8 percent. Tax rate differences such as that between the United States and other OECD countries create incentives for firms to earn more income in lowtax jurisdictions and less income in highertax jurisdictions.14 Because the United States had a corporate income tax rate that was much higher than the norm the U.S. was especially susceptible to base erosion through profit shifting.15 Thus the United States needed a corporate tax rate that was closer to the norm in order to reduce the incentive for firms to shift profits or physical capital and jobs to lowertax jurisdictions. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent dropping the U.S. combined rate from 38.9 percent to 25.7 percent. This puts the United States slightly above the OECD average of 24 percent but slightly below the average weighted by GDP. According to the Tax Foundation s Taxes and Growth Model the combined effect of all the changes in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act will increase the longrun size of the U.S. economy by 1.7 percent.16 The larger economy would result in 1.5 percent higher wages a 4.8 percent larger capital stock and 339000 additional fulltime equivalent jobs in the long run. Source Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model November 2017. The reduction in the corporate tax rate drives these longrun economic benefits by significantly lowering the cost of capital. Source Tax Foundation Taxes and Growth Model November 2017. Note This longrun GDP growth figure is larger than the 1.7 percent of total growth from the plan because several other provisions have negative growth effects. A full list of economic effects by provisions is found in Table 5 of Preliminary Details and Analysis of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The international corporate tax landscape has changed over the past several decades as noted above and the average statutory rates in all regions saw a net decline between 1980 and 2017.17 Once the highest rate in the OECD the United States corporate income tax rate is now closer to the middle of the pack. This will encourage other countries to move away from high taxes on capital toward more competitive corporate income tax rates. The increase in the U.S. s competitiveness implies a relative reduction in the competitiveness of other nations. For example a recent report from the International Monetary Fund recommends to Canada It is time for a careful rethink of corporate taxation to improve efficiency and preserve Canada s position in a rapidly changing international tax environment. 18 The report also notes that the U.S. tax reform increased the urgency of this needed review. This recommendation has been echoed in other countries. For example lawmakers in Australia are considering reducing their corporate income tax rate by 5 percentage points to 25 percent reportedly because the need to reduce the tax burden on businesses had become more pressing for future Australian jobs and investment since the 2016 election because the United States had reduced its top corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. 19 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act improved the global competitiveness of the United States in attracting new investment and other countries are likely to respond with further improvements in their tax systems. It is important for lawmakers to recognize and understand the economic benefits of a globally competitive corporate tax rate and the tradeoffs that increasing the rate would entail. A corporate tax rate that is more in line with our competitors reduces the incentives for firms to realize their profits in lowertax jurisdictions and encourages companies to invest in the United States. Raising the corporate income tax rate would dismantle the most significant progrowth provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and carry significant economic consequences. The table below considers the economic effects of raising the corporate tax rate to 22 and 25 percent from the current baseline of 21 percent. Raising the corporate income tax rate would reduce economic growth and lead to a smaller capital stock lower wage growth and reduced employment. For example permanently raising the corporate rate by 1 percent to 22 percent would reduce longrun GDP by over 56 billion the smaller economy would result in a 0.5 percent decrease in capital stock 0.18 percent decrease in wages and 44500 fewer fulltime equivalent jobs. Raising the rate to 25 percent would reduce GDP by more than 220 billion and result in 175700 fewer jobs. Raising the corporate tax rate increases the cost of making investments in the United States. Under a higher tax rate some investments wouldn t be made which leads to less capital formation and fewer jobs with lower wages. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act reduced the federal corporate income tax rate from 35 percent the highest statutory rate in the developed world to a more globally competitive 21 percent. This significant change is what drives the projected economic effects of the TCJA which include increased investment employment wages and output. Given the positive economic effects of a lower corporate tax rate lawmakers should avoid viewing the corporate income tax as a potential source of raising additional revenue. Raising the corporate tax rate would walk back one of the most significant progrowth provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and reduce the global competitiveness of the United States. Economic evidence indicates that it is workers who bear the final burden of the corporate income tax and that corporate income taxes are the most harmful for economic growth raising this tax rate is not advisable. The new permanently lowered corporate tax rate makes the United States a more attractive place for companies to locate investments and will discourage profit shifting to lowtax jurisdictions. The lower rate incentives new investments that will increase productivity and lead to higher levels of output employment and income in the long run. By permanently lowering the corporate tax rate in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act lawmakers succeeded in making the United States a more globally competitive location for new investment jobs innovation and growth.

Surpluses over the next ten years are based on optimistic assumptions regarding revenues and spending. Even if they do materialize the surpluses will exist only because government accounting obscures the growing cost of future liabilities. The government faces a large longterm deficit and tax cuts would make this problem worse. The proposed 10percent income tax rate cut would provide disproportionately large benefits to wealthy households and little to lower income households. It would have little effect on economic growth but would impose higher burdens on future generations and would reduce future budget discipline by violating the budget rules. Moreover for most families tax burdens are already at their lowest level in twenty years. Saving the surplus by paying down public debt would help the economy much more than would tax cuts. This past January the Congressional Budget Office projected federal surpluses totaling nearly 2.6 trillion between 2000 and 2009. The forecast is notable because the estimate surpassed by more than 1 trillion a similar estimate made last August and for the first time in decades the forecast projected a significant surplus independent of Social Security revenues. This forecast coupled with the release of the president s longawaited Social Security reform proposals has led to an explosion of ideas about how to use the surplus. While there is general agreement that the 1.8 trillion in surpluses accruing in the Social Security Trust Fund should be preserved for future fund obligations views differ considerably about how to allocate the remaining 800 billion in onbudget surpluses among debt repayments government spending and tax cuts. Roughly speaking the president has proposed to use the onbudget surplus to shore up Medicare create a governmentsponsored 401klike saving plan and expand discretionary spending. In sharp contrast leading congressional Republicans including House Budget Chairman John Kasich ROH Senate Finance Chairman William Roth RDE and Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici RNM proposed using the onbudget surplus to finance a 10percent acrosstheboard cut in income tax rates. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott RMS recently convened the first of 150 town meetings to popularize the idea but the proposal was quickly withdrawn amid complaints by moderate Republicans. Nevertheless the prospect of a largescale tax cut financed by the surplus is hardly a dead issue. Just as the federal deficit dominated fiscal policy discussions in the 1980s and early 1990s the emerging budget surpluses will be the centerpieces of tax and spending debates for the next several years. Largescale acrosstheboard tax cuts would be unjustified counterproductive and irresponsible for several reasons. It is unclear how much of the projected onbudget surplus will materialize. More than 75 percent of the surplus arises from projected cuts in real discretionary spending which seem unlikely for political reasons. The forecasts also assume that almost all of the recent revenue increases will prove permanent which is unlikely unless the economy continues to grow rapidly. The surpluses that do materialize will occur only because government accounting procedures obscure enormous accruing future government liabilities. For example more than 45 percent of the projected onbudget surpluses are due to accumulations in government pension reserves. These accumulations like Social Security represent resources owed workers at retirement and should not be spent on tax cuts. More importantly during the next several decades the rising costs of Social Security Medicare and Medicaid will create large fiscal deficits that need to be addressed sooner rather than later. Direct examination of the proposed 10percent cut reveals additional problems. The tax cut would require use of about 200 billion from the Social Security Trust Fund which would violate the general agreement to retain those funds for future retirees. It would provide disproportionately large benefits to the highest income households while providing meager benefits to households in the bottom half of the income distribution. It would not boost economic growth and it would reduce future budget discipline by violating the budget rules. And with the economy running at full employment there is little reason to boost consumer spending by raising aftertax incomes. Finally the case for a tax cut is weakened further by the fact that families at most points in the income distribution will pay a smaller share of their income in federal taxes in 1999 than at any time in the last twenty to thirty years. The combination of a shortterm surplus a sound economy and the lowest tax rates for most households in decades provides a rare confluence of good fortune that should be used to address the nation s pressing longterm fiscal problems related to Social Security and Medicare rather than financing tax cuts. The turnaround in the budget has been astounding. From 1981 to 1995 federal deficits averaged 193 billion. Since then the budget has improved dramatically. By August 1998 CBO projected a 1.5 trillion tenyear surplus and by January 1999 that figure was revised to 2.6 trillion. The improvements can be attributed to many factors. At least some credit should go to deficit reduction packages in 1990 and 1993. George Bush s willingness to abandon his no new taxes pledge and Bill Clinton s 1993 tax increases enhanced the government s fiscal status. The tax acts also raised the top income tax rate from 28 percent to 39.6 percent. As a result when upperincome household earnings expanded dramatically in subsequent years tax revenues rose at a higher than expected rate. In part due to the deficit packages and the lower interest rates they induced the economy has grown continuously since 1992 as unemployment and inflation fell. The improved economy also reflected sound monetary policy low energy prices a burgeoning stock market and substantial good fortune. The deficit packages and the vibrant economy led to reduced spending and increased revenues. Spending fell by 2.9 percent of gross domestic product GDP from 1992 to 1998 while revenues rose by 2.8 percent. Most of the spending decline was due to defense in the aftermath of the demise of the Soviet Union but other types of spending also fell. Most of the revenue surge was due to rising income tax revenues. In particular the stock market boom raised revenue from capital gains and a rise in the income share accruing to highincome taxpayers who face higher tax rates raised revenues further. Whether the 800 billion in projected onbudget surpluses materialize depends on whether these favorable economic revenue and spending trends continue. Although all surplus forecasts are uncertain two key assumptions both probably overly optimistic drive the current estimates. The first is that discretionary spending will decline from 6.6 percent of GDP in 2000 to 5.0 in 2009. This would require nominal spending cuts for fiscal years 2000 to 2002 which politicians already oppose. But holding discretionary spending at a constant share of GDP would cost 1.4 trillion over ten years completely wiping out the surplus. Even holding discretionary spending constant in real terms which would still reduce such spending to 5.4 percent of GDP by 2009 would cost 600 billion or threequarters of the projected surplus. The other questionable assumption is that about 85 percent of the income tax revenue surge will prove permanent. Higher capital gains realizations from the soaring stock market accounted for onethird of the recent revenue increases but equities are unlikely to continue growing at 20 percent per year. If the forecast overstates the actual share of the revenue surge that is permanent by only 10 percentage points future revenues would fall by 300 to 450 billion over the next decade. Thus if the forecast s assumptions about discretionary spending and the revenue surge prove to be too optimistic even by relatively small amounts much or all of the onbudget surplus could disappear. Even if they do materialize the surpluses are only artifacts of the peculiarities of government accounting not reflections of underlying fiscal soundness. Over the next several decades the government faces sizable deficits as an aging population puts pressure on Social Security Medicare and Medicaid expenditures. The appropriate use of the shortterm surplus hinges on whether the shortrun surpluses outweigh the longrun deficits. Indeed it is difficult to see how intelligent policy choices can be made at all in these circumstances without an understanding of the longterm fiscal situation. The CBO estimates that between now and 2070 the federal government faces an annual fiscal deficit of about 0.6 percent of GDP. That is even if all of the projected surpluses materialize and are used to pay down government debt over the next ten years it would require an additional immediate and permanent tax increase of 50 billion with the amount rising over time at the same rate as GDP to bring the government into fiscal balance through 2070. If the onbudget surpluses over the next ten years are used for tax cuts the required tax increase to bring about longterm fiscal balance would almost quadruple to 2.2 percent of GDP. These estimates however understate the financing problem because they stop at 2070 and the government is projected to be running huge deficits after that time. We estimate that an immediate permanent additional tax increase of at least 1.5 percent of GDP in current terms about 125 billion would be required to maintain fiscal balance in the longterm even if the surplus is saved. Because they project so far into the future these estimates are highly uncertain but that does not justify ignoring the longterm problems. The very existence of uncertainty makes the case for corrective action stronger since it means that larger future imbalances which would be very costly to deal with are possible. In addition even with uncertainty about the exact magnitude of the required tax increases it is clear that the government has a financing problem for example no one would dispute that Social Security and Medicare are in need of longterm repair. It is equally clear that tax cuts or delays in efforts to establish fiscal balance will only make the longterm financing problem worse. Thus proper accounting for longterm federal liabilities shows that despite current surpluses the government faces a longterm fiscal deficit which provides no justification for a largescale tax cut. The Joint Committee on Taxation JCT has estimated that a 10percent acrosstheboard cut in income tax rates would reduce tax revenues by 776 billion over the next ten years. Counting the added net interest payments due to higher national debt the total cost would be 984 billion about 200 billion more than the projected tenyear onbudget surplus. The difference would have to be made up by raiding the Social Security Trust Fund. The tax cut would provide benefits to the highest income taxpayers in excess of the proportion of federal taxes they pay. The reason why is that the tax cut applies only to income taxes which are only about half of federal revenues. Most lower and middleincome households pay more in payroll taxes than in income taxes. Only among the highest income households are income taxes the biggest component of federal tax payments. The top 1.8 percent of taxpayers with incomes above 200000 would pay 25 percent of all federal taxes in 2001 under current law but would receive 31 percent of the proposed tax cut. The bottom 70 percent of tax filers with incomes below 50000 pay about 22 percent of all taxes but would receive only 16.6 percent of the tax cut. The increase in aftertax income also would be uniformly higher the higher the income group. The top 1.8 percent of taxpayers would receive an average tax cut of 9221. In contrast for the bottom 70 percent of taxpayers the average tax cut would be 128. Households with income between 10000 and 30000 would receive an average 77 per year cut. For households with income below 10000 the average tax cut is 1. These effects are presumably much less progressive than using the surplus to lessen the needed restructuring of Medicare and Social Security. Tax cut advocates claim an acrosstheboard tax cut would produce beneficial economic effects by boosting personal saving and labor supply. But the effects on saving and labor supply are likely to be tiny both because the increase in aftertax returns would be small and because saving and labor supply are not particularly sensitive to tax rates. Rough calculations indicate that personal saving would not rise by more than 2 percent. However since funds spent on tax cuts cannot be saved by government in the form of debt repayment national saving would fall which would hurt prospects for economic growth. Almost all of the tax cut would be used for personal consumption spending. But in a strong economy the rationale for stimulating consumer spending is weak. Largescale tax cuts would require a waiver of the 1990 budget rules which were designed to avoid deficits and which dictate that tax cuts be offset by other tax increases or mandatory spending cuts. Because reducing the surplus has exactly the same effects as raising the deficit lower national saving higher government debt and interest costs and increased financial burdens placed on future generations there is little justification for removing the rules especially when the surplus is an artifact of arcane and internally inconsistent accounting procedures. Although aggregate tax revenues are at or near alltime highs relative to GDP families at most points of the income distribution face federal taxes in 1999 that are as low or lower than anytime in the past twenty to thirty years. Overall tax payments have risen because the rich have gotten richer at an impressive rate and because they have faced higher tax rates due to policy changes in 1990 and 1993. Congressional Budget Office estimates indicate that for households in the bottom 60 percent of the income distribution the burden of all federal taxes is at its lowest level since at least 1977 Figure 1. Only among the top 20 percent of households have tax burdens risen since the 1980s and only to levels slightly higher than in the 1970s. However real income for the top 20 percent of households was about 40 percent higher in 1999 than in 1977. In a progressive tax system average tax rates are expected to rise a little bit as real income rises so the tax bite on high income households is hardly devastating. In fact even with their rise in average tax rates pre and posttax income grew much faster among the top 20 percent of households between 1977 and 1999 than in the next 20 percent and in the bottom 60 percent both pre and posttax income fell. Source Congressional Budget Office 1998 and Committee on Ways and Means 1993 Other research confirms that taxes are lower for most households. The Treasury Department estimates that for a fourperson family with wages of 55000 income taxes in 1999 will be at their lowest levels since 1966. A fourperson family with wages of 110000 will face in 1999 its lowest tax rate since 1972. A similar family with wages of 27500 will face its lowest income tax burden since at least 1955. These studies suggest that all federal state and local taxes account for about 26 to 30 percent of income for middleincome families. Even this figure overstates tax burdens however since about 40 percent of the total tax burden and twothirds of the federal burden consist of payroll taxes which are associated with future Social Security benefits. And many families of course pay substantially less a family of four can earn 28200 or about 540 per week and pay no federal income taxes. American tax burdens also are low compared with those in other industrialized countries. Among the twenty largest Organization of Economic Cooperation Development countries in 1996 the United States reported the lowest ratio of taxes to GDP. Nevertheless tax cut advocates like to report that the typical twoearner family paid nearly 40 percent of its income in taxes last year. This claim however is flawed and vastly overstates tax burdens. The misleading estimate comes from a study by the Tax Foundation a Washington organization that tracks tax policy. Close inspection of the Tax Foundation s study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and others reveals several problems. The foundation s tax measure does not include adjustments for popular deductions like child credits or flexible spending accounts. The measure of income overlooks pension contributions and health insurance. The study includes estate taxes which are only paid in about 1.5 percent of all deaths. The foundation adds corporate taxes to families tax burdens but does not add corporate earnings to families income. It includes property taxes but not the imputed income from housing. Ultimately whether Americans are overtaxed is a judgment call. The measure of appropriate tax levels depends on many factors including an analysis of how the money is used. But the evidence speaks clearly in at least two dimensions the vast majority of American families pay nowhere near 40 percent of income in taxes and they forfeit a smaller share of their income to taxes today than they would have in the past with the same income. Some tax cut advocates have argued that tax revenues belong to the American people and that any excess should be returned to them. The problem is that the future liabilities of government also belong to the American people. The question in each case is which American people today s or tomorrow s? It would be irresponsible for taxpayers or government simply to ignore the impending retirement of the baby boomers and the spending obligations that the American people s congressional representatives have incurred. The emerging federal surpluses are no minor achievement but are only first steps toward longrun fiscal sustainability. The shortterm surpluses are an accounting illusion and the longterm forecast shows a significant fiscal deficit. U.S. fiscal policy and the economy have benefitted from a demographic holiday during the last fifteen to twenty years. Although we can generate budget surpluses while the baby boomers are in their peak taxpaying years our fiscal problems will be massive if they cannot be resolved by the time the boomers retire and start receiving benefits. Tax cuts not only do not solve this problem they make it worse. The fiscal 1999 federal budget provides a rare opportunity to address the nation s longterm fiscal problems from the vantage point of a shortterm surplus a strong economy and the lowest tax burdens for most families in decades. Under these circumstances focusing on longterm problems now while they are still manageable is an offer we cannot afford to refuse.
