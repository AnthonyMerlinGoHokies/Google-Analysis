These actions The BidenHarris Administration is lowering health care costs for rural Americans and supporting access to high quality care in rural America. Over sixty million people live in rural America. Compared to their urban counterparts rural Americans are more likely to live in poverty be older be uninsured have disabilities and have fewer health care providers available within their area. The Affordable Care Act ACA has helped to reduce the rates of uninsured rural individuals nationally with the rate of uninsured rural individuals falling from 19 in 2012 to 13 in 2019 the rate of uninsured individuals living in rural areas in nonMedicaid expansion states however has fallen at a slower rate than those living in Medicaid expansion states from 38 to 32 over the same timeframe. Over 150 rural hospitals have either closed their doors entirely or stopped providing inpatient hospital services since 2010 and being in a Medicaid expansion state decreased the likelihood of a rural hospital closing by more than half. Rural communities often have fewer local health care providers available with over 50 of rural counties having no access to hospitalbased maternity care and 70 lacking even a single psychiatrist often requiring patients to travel long distances to access care. The Department of Health and Human Services HHS is helping to ensure people in rural America have access to high quality health care.  INCREASING HEALTH COVERAGE FOR RURAL AMERICANS. Rural communities rely on the Marketplace Medicaid and Medicare 1 in 3 rural adults are enrolled in Medicare 1 in 6 are enrolled in state Medicaid programs and 1 in 10 are covered by Marketplace coverage. This is particularly true for children 47 of children living in small towns and rural areas are enrolled in Medicaid compared to 40 of children in urban areas. Medicaid expansion has played a key role in expanding health coverage in rural communities. In 2019 rural uninsured rates were nearly twice as high in nonexpansion states as expansion states. These actions will help improve access to health coverage that greatly benefit rural communities. KEEPING MORE RURAL HOSPITALS OPEN SO THEY CAN PROVIDE CRITICAL SERVICES IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. The Administration has made billions of dollars available to rural communities including funding to small rural hospitals and Medicarecertified Rural Health Clinics in response to the COVID19 pandemic and to improve access to care. With the concerning trend of rural hospital closures the BidenHarris Administration is taking action to give rural hospitals support and flexibility to stay open to provide needed services for their community. BOLSTER RURAL WORKFORCE CAPACITY. With fewer health care providers in rural areas the BidenHarris Administration is announcing a set of actions to develop the pipeline of health care workers including increasing incentives for health care providers to train and work in rural communities. SUPPORTING ACCESS TO CARE. The BidenHarris Administration will support rural communities having access to reliable care through approaches that expand access to outpatient behavioral health and telehealth services.

Grants Will Benefit More Than 5 Million People in Rural America Contact USDA PressEmail pressusda.gov CHARLOTTESVILLE Va. July 25 2023 U.S. Department of Agriculture USDA Deputy Secretary Xochitl Torres Small today announced that USDA is expanding access to health care for more than 5 million people living in 39 states and Puerto Rico as part of President Biden s Investing in America agenda.  During one of the most critical times in our nation s history the BidenHarris Administration responded to deliver immediate economic relief and ensure rural people have access to quality health care Deputy Secretary Torres Small said. USDA s Emergency Rural Health Care Grants are helping strengthen rural America s health care infrastructure to build for the future.  USDA is awarding 129 million in Emergency Rural Health Care Grants to improve health care facilities in rural towns across the nation. These grants will help 172 rural health care organizations expand critical services. Today s investments will help regional partnerships public bodies nonprofits and Tribes solve regional rural health care challenges. These solutions will build a stronger more sustainable rural health care system for the nation s small towns and communities. For example in the Midwest Southern Illinois Hospital Services is partnering with local health care organizations to build an inpatient psychiatric unit to address a regional need to expand access to mental health care services for people living in Southern Illinois. The investments will help people in the West benefit from stateofthe art medical equipment that will enhance their access to quality health care. The investments will improve health outcomes for people in rural communities by improving access to healthy foods in the Northeast. In the South people in rural areas will benefit from new stateoftheart medical facilities. For instance Pancare of Florida Inc. is building a primary care clinic as part of its regional health care center. The clinic will help people living in rural and underserved communities in Northwest Florida access quality health care services. Torres Small announced the awards today at the University of Virginia. USDA is providing a grant to the university s Virginia Consortium to Advance Healthcare in Appalachia a notforprofit group that will use the funds to expand access to health care and telemedicine in Wise County. The funding will also help the group expand regional networks for resource sharing training education and communications. This group will also develop a blueprint for addressing pandemic emergency chronic illnesses and enhancing the longterm sustainability of rural health care. The investments USDA is announcing will also expand health care services in Alabama Arizona Arkansas California Colorado Delaware Florida Georgia Illinois Indiana Iowa Kansas Louisiana Maine Maryland Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota Mississippi Missouri Montana Nebraska New Jersey New York North Carolina North Dakota Ohio Oklahoma Oregon Pennsylvania Rhode Island South Carolina South Dakota Tennessee Texas Virginia Washington Wisconsin Wyoming and Puerto Rico. This funding is made possible by President Biden s historic legislative package the American Rescue Plan Act. The Act and this program are examples of the government s ability to respond quickly to ensure every person and family has access to highquality health care. Background Emergency Rural Health Care Grants Congress passed the American Rescue Plan Act in March 2021 to deliver immediate economic relief to people impacted by the pandemic. Within months after the Act s passage USDA responded quickly by making this funding available to ensure the longterm availability of rural health care services. In August 2021 USDA made the Emergency Rural Health Care Grants available through the American Rescue Plan Act to help rural health care facilities tribes and communities expand access to health care services and nutrition assistance. The assistance is helping provide immediate relief to support rural hospitals health care clinics and local communities. USDA is administering the funds through Rural Development s Community Facilities Program. Under the BidenHarris Administration Rural Development provides loans and grants to help expand economic opportunities create jobs and improve the quality of life for millions of Americans in rural areas. This assistance supports infrastructure improvements business development housing community facilities such as schools public safety and health care and highspeed internet access in rural tribal and highpoverty areas.

https://www.aha.org/fact-sheets/2021-05-26-fact-sheet-infrastructure-investments-needed-support-access-care-rural, Every day roughly 57 million rural Americans depend on their hospital as an important source of care as well as a critical component of their area s economic and social fabric. Rural hospitals and health systems have been on the front lines of the COVID19 pandemic and have remained committed to ensuring local access to highquality affordable health care including assisting with testing contact tracing and vaccine deployment. Yet rural hospitals face unprecedented financial and health care challenges. This includes severely deteriorated hospital finances aging physical plants and lack of broadband and highspeed internet an aging and burntout workforce and a patient population that is increasingly older poorer and sicker than other parts of the country. We cannot leave our rural communities behind. Federal investment is necessary to ensure that rural communities are able to preserve access to essential health care services. New infrastructure investments must be made to ensure rural communities can thrive in the health care system of the 21st century. The AHA urges Congress and the Biden Administration to prioritize funding for the infrastructure that supports rural hospitals and the communities they serve. Key areas of investment include physical infrastructure and rightsizing capacity to enable digital health workforce support and access to behavioral health services.

Approximately 61 million Americans live in rural Tribal and geographically isolated communities across the United States. These communities often experience significant health inequities. Compared to urban Americans rural Americans are more likely to have heart disease stroke cancer unintentional injuries suicide risk and chronic lung disease and have higher death rates from COVID19. As clinicians we have seen these rural health disparities firsthand. One example is a patient who lived far from a health care facility didn t have a usual source of care and didn t tell anyone about his chest pain until he had a heart attack. Another is a patient with opioid use disorder who lacked access to a nearby source of regular care and didn t find a primary care doctor until after her first overdose. A third is a patient who required surgery on her arteries because her underlying conditions were not addressed in the rural community where she lived. Addressing rural health inequities is a cornerstone of the Centers for Medicare Medicaid Services CMS effort to improve health equity. CMS defines health equity as the attainment of the highest level of health for all people whereby every person has a fair and just opportunity to attain their optimal health regardless of their race ethnicity disability sexual orientation gender identity socioeconomic status preferred language and geography including whether they live in a rural or other underserved community. CMS commitment to rural health equity is reflected in the recently published CMS Framework for Advancing Health Care in Rural Tribal and Geographically Isolated Communities.  With almost 1 trillion in claims annually and more than 63 million covered Americans including one in three adults who live in rural areas Medicare has the potential to significantly impact health care delivered in rural settings. In this piece we highlight some of CMS policies to support rural providers improve access to care in rural areas and support the transformation of the rural health delivery system. Supporting rural providers The shortage of health care providers in rural areas exacerbates rural health disparities. Only 12 of physicians practice in rural communities and the majority of areas deemed health professional shortage areas by the federal government 61 percent are located in rural areas. These communities also face shortages of other critical health care professionals including nurse practitioners dentists and social workers. Over the last decade many rural hospitals have closed. Many currently face potential closure due to lower or inconsistent patient volume and staff shortages compounded by fewer job applicants in rural areas.  Rural hospitals and communities may find support under a Medicare regulation implementing a provision of the Consolidated Appropriations Act 2021 creating a Rural Emergency Hospital REH provider type. In exchange for providing emergency department services and observation care and if elected by the facility other outpatient1 medical and health services Medicare will pay REHs an additional five percent compared to the normal Medicare outpatient rates for most services and will provide a monthly payment that will increase every year with inflation. The intent is that these measures will support financial stability and give rural hospitals at risk of closure another option to provide access to care in rural communities.  Rural hospitals and Critical Access Hospitals can apply to CMS to elect to become an REH starting January 1 2023. To qualify hospitals must have 50 or fewer beds and agree not to provide inpatient care. CMS broadly defined the type of services that REHs can provide to maintain access to critical care in rural communities while ensuring patients can be transferred to an acute care hospital if more intensive services are needed. REHs can offer all services that can be provided in an outpatient department such as emergency care in addition to maternity care and outpatient surgery. REHs must also offer observation care so they can observe a patient who isn t ready to be released from an emergency department. Hospitals interested in electing this new REH designation are encouraged to review the materials at the bottom of this post.  Expanding access to care in rural areas Telehealth is an essential tool to reach people living in rural areas which face provider shortages and transportation challenges. As clinicians some of us have personally delivered telehealth services and seen firsthand how it has allowed persons in rural areas to access health care from the comfort and privacy of their own homes.  However broadband and computer access can still be significant obstacles to using telehealth in rural areas. This is why after Congressional action Medicare permanently expanded access to behavioral health services furnished via telehealth including audioonly services that often just require a telephone. To further increase access for people in rural areas CMS has proposed incentives for Medicare Advantage plans to include behavioral health clinicians who can provide telehealth services in their networks. Additionally CMS has proposed requirements that Medicare Advantage plans assess enrolled individuals for digital health literacy. For those found to have low digital health literacy Medicare Advantage organizations would develop and maintain procedures to offer digital health education to their enrollees to assist them with accessing telehealth. Beyond telehealth CMS concentrates on expanding access to behavioral health care in rural areas including in Medicare Advantage. CMS has proposed a new requirement for evaluating the provider networks of Medicare Advantage plans to ensure the plans provider networks provide sufficient access to clinical psychologists licensed clinical social workers and clinicians that can prescribe medication that treats opioid use disorder. This would help ensure that people enrolled in Medicare Advantage especially in rural areas have more accessible options for meeting their behavioral health needs. CMS also focuses on addressing opioid use disorder particularly as overdose rates have skyrocketed and rural areas have been significantly affected. Medicare has clarified that it will pay for opioid use disorder treatment services delivered by mobile units of opioid treatment programs. These mobile units are equipped with medical supplies and specially trained staff and studies have shown that these types of mobile services improve access to medication that treats opioid use disorder particularly in rural areas.  Transforming the rural health delivery system Finally expanding access to highquality coordinated care through valuebased arrangements will also better support the needs of rural Americans. For instance CMS is improving the Medicare Shared Savings Program which has improved the delivery of highquality care in rural areas. Shared Savings Program Accountable Care Organizations ACOs are groups of doctors hospitals and other health care providers collaborating to give coordinated highquality care to people with Medicare. The program s goal is to ensure that people receive the right care at the right time prioritizing their health while preventing medical errors and avoiding unnecessary and duplicative tests and treatments. However we have seen over time that ACOs are less common in rural areas compared to urban ones.  To address this CMS is incorporating lessons learned from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation s ACO Investment Model into the Shared Savings Program to provide upfront investment dollars to newlyforming smaller ACOs that treat lowincome patients or patients who live in rural or other underserved areas. ACOs could use these upfront payments to hire new health care workers such as community health workers or behavioral health practitioners helping to address provider shortages in rural areas. ACOs could also use these funds to address the social needs of persons with Medicare such as assisting with food housing or even transportation needs that are particularly prevalent in rural areas with higher poverty rates.  In addition the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation is actively examining ways through existing and new models to improve access to highquality health care in rural areas including increasing participation by safety net and Medicaid providers in valuebased care models.  Summing up The threepronged approach of supporting rural providers expanding access to care in rural areas and transforming the rural health delivery system can improve access to highquality coordinated care for people in rural communities. However the magnitude of these changes will only be realized in partnership with rural health providers rural communities beneficiaries caregivers and other payers especially Medicaid.  We recognize that many rural providers and communities may need time to consider the new policies and programs outlined in this piece and corresponding regulations and there are teams available to answer any questions and provide support as needed. Only by working together can we improve access to care in rural areas and advance rural health equity.

A 1993 National Academies report Access to Healthcare in America defined access as the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes. A 2014 RUPRI Health Panel report on rural healthcare access summarizes additional definitions of access with examples of measures that can be used to determine access.   Ideally residents should be able to conveniently and confidently access services such as primary care dental care behavioral health emergency care and public health services. Access to healthcare is important for   Rural residents often encounter barriers to healthcare that limit their ability to obtain the care they need. Access to healthcare implies that healthcare services are available and obtainable in a timely manner. Yet rural residents often encounter barriers to healthcare access. Even when an adequate supply of healthcare services exists in the community there are other factors that may impede healthcare access. For instance to have healthcare access rural residents must also have   This guide provides an overview of healthcare access in rural America including discussion of the importance and benefits of healthcare access and the barriers that rural residents experience. The guide includes information regarding   For information on access to public health services in rural communities see the Rural Public Health Agencies topic guide.   The supply of primary care providers per capita is lower in rural areas compared to urban areas according to Supply and Distribution of the Primary Care Workforce in Rural America 2019. Travel to reach a primary care provider may be costly and burdensome for patients living in remote rural areas with subspecialty care often even farther away. These patients may substitute local primary care providers for subspecialists or they may decide to postpone or forego care. Access in Brief Rural and Urban Health Care compares access to care and use of services for rural and urban adults and children with Medicaid coverage and shows that from 20132015 34 of urban adults utilized the emergency room ER for care compared to 43.5 of rural adults who utilized the ER. The high number of ER visits can be an indicator that the patient lacks a usual source of care or has developed emergent health problems due to foregone care.   According to the 2014 RUPRI Health Panel report Access to Rural Health Care A Literature Review and New Synthesis barriers to healthcare result in unmet healthcare needs including a lack of preventive and screening services and treatment of illnesses. A vital rural community is dependent on the health of its population. While access to medical care does not guarantee good health access to healthcare is critical for a populations wellbeing and optimal health.   The challenges that rural residents face in accessing healthcare services contribute to health disparities. To learn more about disparities in health outcomes see RHIhubs Rural Health Disparities topic guide.   Rural populations are more likely to have to travel long distances to access healthcare services particularly subspecialist services. This can be a significant burden in terms of travel time cost and time away from the workplace. In addition the lack of reliable transportation is a barrier to care. In urban areas public transit is generally an option for patients to get to medical appointments however these transportation services are often lacking in rural areas. Rural communities often have more elderly residents who have chronic conditions requiring multiple visits to outpatient healthcare facilities. This becomes challenging without available public or private transportation. RHIhubs Transportation to Support Rural Healthcare topic guide provides resources and information about transportation and related issues for rural communities.   Healthcare workforce shortages impact healthcare access in rural communities. One measure of healthcare access is having a regular source of care which is dependent on having an adequate healthcare workforce. Some health services researchers argue that evaluating healthcare access by simply measuring provider availability is not an adequate measure to fully understand healthcare access. Measures of nonuse such as counting rural residents who could not find an appropriate care provider can help provide a fuller picture of whether a sufficient healthcare workforce is available to rural residents. See What statelevel policies and programs can help address the problem of shortages in the rural healthcare workforce? on RHIhubs Rural Health Workforce topic guide for more information.   A shortage of healthcare professionals in rural areas of the U.S. can restrict access to healthcare by limiting the supply of available services. As of September 2022 65.6 of Primary Care Health Professional Shortage Areas HPSAs were located in rural areas. For the most current numbers see the Health Resource and Services Administration HRSAs Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics. HRSA also includes statistics on mental health and dental HPSAs.   Primary Care HPSAs are scored 025 with higher scores indicating a greater need for primary care providers. This April 2024 map highlights nonmetropolitan areas with primary care workforce shortages with areas in darker green indicating higher nonmetro HPSA scores   For more information on healthcare workforce challenges in rural areas resources and strategies used to address rural healthcare workforce shortages see RHIhubs Rural Healthcare Workforce topic guide.   Individuals without health insurance have less access to healthcare services. According to Geographic Variation in Health Insurance Coverage United States 2022 nonmetropolitan children and adults under 65 were more likely than their metropolitan peers to be uninsured.   The June 2016 issue brief from the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation Impact of the Affordable Care Act Coverage Expansion on Rural and Urban Populations found that 43.4 of uninsured rural residents reported not having a usual source of care which was less than the 52.6 of uninsured urban residents reporting not having a usual source of care. Yet the brief reports that 26.5 of uninsured rural residents delayed receiving healthcare in the past year due to cost. The Affordable Care Act and Insurance Coverage in Rural Areas a 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation issue brief points out that uninsured rural residents face greater difficulty accessing care due to the limited supply of rural healthcare providers who offer lowcost or charity healthcare when compared to their urban counterparts.   Health insurance affordability is a concern for rural areas. A RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis policy brief Health Insurance Marketplaces Issuer Participation and Premium Trends in Rural Places 2018 evaluated changes in average health insurance marketplace HIM plan premiums from 2014 to 2018. Average premiums were higher in rural counties than in urban counties. In addition rural counties were more likely to have only one insurance issuer participating in the HIM. Medicare Advantage plan copays and deductibles are higher in rural and nocost benefits like health clubs and transportation are less frequently offered in rural areas.   While the use of telehealth services was already becoming more popular and widespread at the beginning of 2020 measures implemented in response to the COVID19 pandemic accelerated this growth. Unfortunately many areas lack access to broadband internet and experience slow internet speeds both of which are barriers to accessing telehealth services. Compared to their urban counterparts rural individuals are nearly two times more likely to lack broadband access. A Peterson Center on Healthcare and Kaiser Family Foundation report How Might Internet Connectivity Affect Health Care Access? stated that 7 of people in metropolitan areas did not have access to internet at home in 2019 while 13 of people in nonmetropolitan areas lacked access. To learn about additional challenges for rural telehealth use see What are the challenges related to providing telehealth services in rural communities? on RHIhubs Telehealth and Health Information Technology in Rural Healthcare topic guide.   Health literacy can also be a barrier to accessing healthcare. Health literacy impacts a patients ability to understand health information and instructions from their healthcare providers. This can be especially concerning in rural communities where lower educational levels and higher incidence of poverty often impact residents. Low health literacy can make residents reluctant to seek healthcare due to fear or frustration related to communicating with a healthcare professional. Additionally navigating the healthcare system can be difficult without health literacy skills. To learn more about low health literacy in rural America see the Rural Health Literacy Toolkit in RHIhubs evidencebased toolkits. The Rural Monitors 2017 twopart series on rural health literacy Understanding Skills and Demands is Key to Improvement and Whos Delivering Health Information? explores connections between health and health literacy and how health information is being delivered to rural populations. The Rural Monitors 2022 twopart series A New Era of Health Literacy? Expanded Definitions Digital Influences and Rural Inequities and Educating Future Healthcare Providers Health Literacy Opportunities for Webside Manners explores health literacy in the digital era.   In rural areas because there is little anonymity social stigma and privacy concerns are more likely to act as barriers to healthcare access. Rural residents can have concerns about seeking care for mental health substance use sexual health pregnancy or even common chronic illnesses due to unease or privacy concerns. Patients feelings may be caused by personal relationships with their healthcare provider or others working in the healthcare facility. Additionally patients can feel fear or concerns about other residents who are often friends family members or coworkers who may notice them utilizing services for health conditions that are typically not openly discussed such as counseling or HIV testing services. Colocation or the integration of behavioral health services with primary care healthcare services in the same building can help ease patient concerns. Understanding Rural Communities a 2018 podcast from the Hogg Foundation for Mental Health features an interview with Dennis Mohatt the Vice President for Behavioral Health at the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education WICHE discussing rural health and the stigma surrounding mental healthcare in rural communities.   Primary care in addition to emergency and public health care are essential rural healthcare services. Primary care providers offer a broad range of services and treat a wide spectrum of medical issues. The American Academy of Family Physicians characterizes primary care as follows   A 2005 Milbank Quarterly article Contribution of Primary Care to Health Systems and Health identifies the key roles primary care access plays in preventing disease and improving health. Primary care serves as a first entry point into the health system which can be particularly important for groups such as rural residents and racialethnic minorities who might otherwise face barriers to accessing healthcare. Some benefits of primary care access are   Access to Quality Health Services in Rural Areas Primary Care A Literature Review a section of the 2015 report Rural Healthy People 2020 A Companion Document to Healthy People 2020 Volume 1 provides an overview of the impact primary care access has on rural health. Rural residents with limited primary care access may not receive preventive screenings that can lead to early detection and treatment of disease. A North Carolina Rural Health Research Program 2018 findings brief Access to Care Populations in Counties with No FQHC RHC or Acute Care Hospital describes the scope of limited primary care access in rural areas in the U.S. and covers three facility types that provide primary care services to rural communities including Federally Qualified Health Centers FQHCs Rural Health Clinics RHCs and acute care hospital outpatient departments. The findings brief reports that there are 660893 U.S. residents who live in rural counties without an FQHC RHC or acute care hospital. A 2019 Rural Minority Health Research Center Findings Brief states that 279 rural counties did not have an FQHC or RHC and 72 of those counties were isolated from primary care safety net providers. For more information on primary care in rural and urban areas see Primary Care in the United States A Chartbook of Facts and Statistics from the Robert Graham Center.   To learn more about FQHCs see RHIhubs Federally Qualified Health Centers FQHCs topic guide. Additionally RHIhubs Rural Health Clinics RHCs topic guide answers frequently asked questions on these types of facilities and provides information and resources.   Home health services in rural America are a growing need but may be difficult to access for some rural residents. A 2022 Rural Minority Health Research Center findings brief indicates that 10.3 of all rural ZIP Code Tabulation Areas ZCTAs were not served by any home health agency with frontier and remote areas having the least access to home health care. Home is Where the Heart Is Insights on the Coordination and Delivery of Home Health Services in Rural America an August 2017 Rural Health Reform Policy Research Center policy brief covers many barriers and challenges facing rural home health agencies that affect their ability to provide access in rural areas including   See To what extent are home health services available in rural communities? on the Rural Home Health Services topic guide for more information.   Hospice and palliative care agencies often face barriers and challenges similar to other healthcare services in rural areas. These challenges can include workforce shortages recruitment and retention programs reimbursement issues limited access to broadband and others.   RHIhubs Rural Hospice and Palliative Care topic guide answers frequently asked questions and provides resources on hospice and palliative care in rural areas. Communitybased Palliative Care Scaling Access for Rural Populations an October 2018 Rural Monitor article describes the role palliative care plays in meeting the needs of patients who are chronically and seriously ill and covers challenges to accessing palliative care in rural areas.   Access to mental health providers and services is a challenge in rural areas. As a result primary care providers often fill the gap and provide mental health services. However primary care providers may face challenges that may limit their ability to provide mental health care access such as inadequate financial reimbursement or lack of time with patients.   As of September 2022 60.58 of Mental Health Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. For the most current figures see HRSAs Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics.   Mental Health HPSAs are scored 025 with higher scores indicating a greater need for mental health providers. The April 2024 map below highlights mental health HPSAs for both metro areas in multiple shades of purple and nonmetro areas in various shades of green.   Due to the lack of mental health providers in rural communities the use of telehealth to deliver mental health services is increasing. The June 2016 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality technical brief Telehealth Mapping the Evidence for Patient Outcomes from Systematic Reviews found that mental health services can be effectively delivered via telehealth. By using telehealth delivery systems mental health services can be provided in a variety of rural settings including rural clinics schools residential programs longterm care facilities and individual patient homes. Additionally the Calendar Year CY 2022 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Final Rule made permanent the ability for FQHCs and RHCs to be reimbursed by Medicare for telemental health appointments. RHIhubs Telehealth and Health Information Technology in Rural Healthcare topic guide has many more resources on how telehealth can improve access to care. For additional resources on access to mental health services in rural areas see RHIhubs Rural Mental Health topic guide.   For more information see the 2016 WWAMI Rural Health Research Center data brief Supply and Distribution of the Behavioral Health Workforce in Rural America. The brief discusses and compares the provider to population ratios of the behavioral health workforce in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan U.S. counties including micropolitan and noncore areas. A statelevel analysis of the study is also available with information for all states.   Despite a growing need there is a shortage of substance use disorder services offered in many rural communities across America.   A 2015 American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse article Rural Substance Use Treatment Centers in the United States An Assessment of Treatment Quality by Location reports that rural substance use disorder treatment centers had a lower proportion of highly educated counselors compared to urban centers. Rural treatment centers were found to offer fewer wraparound services and specialized treatment tracks.   Detoxification is an initial step of substance use disorder treatment that involves managing acute intoxication withdrawal and minimizing medical complications. A 2009 Maine Rural Health Research Center research and policy brief Few and Far Away Detoxification Services in Rural Areas found that 82 of rural residents live in a county without a detox provider. The lack of detox providers in rural areas creates a barrier to care that could result in patients forgoing or delaying needed treatment. In lieu of a detox provider in a rural community the local emergency room or county jail although not the most appropriate location for detoxification services must often serve as a substitute.   Access to medication for opioid use disorder MOUD is also limited in rural communities. Whats MAT Got to Do with It? MedicationAssisted Treatment for Opioid Use Disorder in Rural America provides an overview of MOUD previously referred to as MAT an evidencebased treatment for opioid use disorder with information on the science behind the disorder and how three medications for opioid use disorder work. According to Practical Tools for Prescribing and Promoting Buprenorphine in Primary Care Settings rural areas benefit from using the drug buprenorphine for MOUD treatment but often face staffing transportation and technology constraints that prevent making MOUD a viable option in rural communities. This source recommends leveraging nonphysician staff for treatment prescribing buprenorphine for athome treatment and engaging the local community to build service locations as strategies to overcome barriers. See our Rural Medication for Opioid Use Disorder MOUD Toolkit for more information.   A shortage of mental health and substance use disorder clinicians in rural communities led to the development of new models to bridge the gap and provide needed mental health and substance use disorder services using allied behavioral health workers such as   RHIhubs Substance Use and Misuse in Rural Areas and Rural Response to the Opioid Crisis topic guides provide information and resources answer frequently asked questions and list model programs to address substance use disorder and model programs to address opioid use in rural areas.   Reproductive healthcare is typically more difficult to access in rural areas. According to the Kaiser Family Foundations KFF issue brief Womens Sexual and Reproductive Health Services Key Findings from the 2020 KFF Womens Health Survey rural women are less likely to have had a recent pap test and less likely to have access to a provider who discussed reproductive health issues with them such as contraception sexual and relationship history sexually transmitted infections STIs and other transmissible diseases preexposure prophylaxis PrEP and menopause.   Access to obstetric services is a persistent but growing concern in rural areas. A 2022 Center for Economic Analysis of Rural Health policy brief CountyLevel Availability of Obstetric Care and Economic Implications of Hospital Closures on Obstetric Care reports that out of 148 counties that lost obstetric services between 2012 and 2019 due to hospital or unit closuresconversions 113 of the counties were rural. A June 2020 University of Minnesota Rural Health Research Center UMN RHRC infographic Loss of Hospitalbased Obstetric Services in Rural Counties in the United States 20042018 displays similar data. According to the document only 27 of noncore counties had hospitalbased OB services as of 2018. A 2022 report from March of Dimes states that 911 rural U.S. counties are maternity care deserts. Additionally a 2020 action plan from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Healthy Women Healthy Pregnancies Healthy Futures Action Plan to Improve Maternal Health in America points out that although 15 of people in the U.S. live in rural communities only 6 of OBGYNs serve these areas. However many rural family physicians provide broad OBGYN services to their patients.   A 2014 committee opinion from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG Health Disparities in Rural Women reports that prenatal care initiation in the first trimester was lower for mothers in more rural areas compared with suburban areas. Access to labor and delivery prenatal and related services is also a concern of ACOG reporting that less than one half of rural women live within a 30minute drive to the nearest hospital offering perinatal services.   A 2020 case study Making it Work Models of Success in Rural Maternity Care discusses 3 rural obstetric service providers highlighting the importance of strong partnerships collaboration and community support to maintaining successful rural maternity care. The RHIhub Rural Maternal Health Toolkit also discusses access to maternity care in rural areas.   The 2019 National Rural Health Association NRHA policy brief Access to Rural Maternity Care provides an overview of the decline in access to maternity care in rural areas and factors contributing to the decline in access. The brief offers policy considerations to support maternity care services and address barriers to access in the rural U.S. such as increasing research funding rural OB practice challenges workforce issues and quality of OB care. The report Restoring Access to Maternity Care in Rural America discusses strategies to improve maternal care such as creating maternity care networks promoting visibility for care helping rural providers care for patients with highrisk pregnancies utilizing telemedicine expanding and training the rural healthcare workforce enlisting nonclinical partners and more.   Oral health can affect overall physical and emotional health. For example oral health needs that are not addressed can lead to pain cosmetic concerns and can affect academic or professional success. Despite the importance of oral health access to dental care is either very limited or difficult to access in many rural and remote communities.   Traditionally health insurance plans have not covered oral health services. A separate dental insurance plan is needed to cover oral health services and procedures. According to the 2021 National Institutes of Health report Oral Health in America fewer rural residents have dental insurance compared to urban residents.   Another factor limiting access to dental services is the lack of dental health professionals in rural and underserved areas. As of September 2022 67.06 of Dental Health Professional Shortage Areas were located in rural areas. For the most current numbers see HRSAs Designated Health Professional Shortage Areas Statistics. A June 2015 WWAMI Rural Health Research Center report Dentist Supply Dental Care Utilization and Oral Health Among Rural and Urban U.S. Residents found that rural adults used dental services less and had more permanent tooth loss compared to urban adults which could be related to the scarcity of dentists in rural areas. According to 20202021 HRSA Area Health Resource Files there are 7.5 dentists per 10000 citizens in metropolitan areas and 4.7 dentists per 10000 citizens in nonmetropolitan areas.   A May 2018 NRHA policy brief Improving Rural Oral Healthcare Access offers recommendations to address dental workforce shortages and to ultimately improve access to oral health services including   For more information see What oral health disparities are present in rural America? on RHIhubs Oral Health in Rural Communities topic guide.   The closure of rural healthcare facilities or the discontinuation of services can have a negative impact on access to healthcare in rural communities.   Local rural healthcare systems are fragile when one facility closes or a provider leaves it can impact care and access across the community. For example if a surgeon leaves Csection access declines and obstetric care is jeopardized. If a hospital closes it may be harder to recruit physicians.   There are multiple factors that can affect the severity and impact of a hospital or healthcare facility closure on healthcare access including   Traveling to receive healthcare services places the burden on patients. For individuals with low incomes no paid time off from their jobs physical limitations acute conditions or no personal transportation these burdens can significantly affect their ability to access healthcare services.   A significant concern for rural communities losing their hospital is the loss of emergency services. In emergency situations care delays can have serious adverse consequences on patient outcomes.   A 2015 findings brief from the North Carolina Rural Health Research Program A Comparison of Closed Rural Hospitals and Perceived Impact identifies the following potential impacts on healthcare access due to hospital closure   The North Carolina Rural Health Research Program maintains an interactive map which displays locations of rural hospital closures in the U.S. from January 2005 to present. According to the map 183 rural hospitals had closed as of July 2022. Unfortunately rural health experts believe rural hospital closures are likely to continue because many rural hospitals have minimal operating margins with little room for financial loss. According to the 2022 findings brief Since 1990 Rural Hospital Closures Have Increasingly Occurred in Counties that Are More Urbanized Diverse and Economically Unequal closures disproportionately impact communities of color impoverished areas and rural counties in the South.   Alternative models and provider types may be needed to meet access needs in rural areas in the event of closures. A 2016 Medicare Payment Advisory Commission presentation Improving Efficiency and Preserving Access to Emergency Care in Rural Areas describes policies and strategies to ensure access to emergency department services in rural areas. The presentation provides discussion on alternative healthcare delivery models. The 2020 research brief Alternatives to Hospital Closure Findings from a National Survey of CAH Executives explores options to maintain access in rural communities whose hospitals are encountering negative profit margins.   Additional closures impacting rural areas can be seen in nursing homes in nonmetropolitan counties. Trends in Nursing Home Closures in Nonmetropolitan and Metropolitan Counties in the United States 20082018 shows that in this time span 472 nursing homes closed in 400 nonmetropolitan counties and as of 2018 10.1 of rural counties in the U.S. were considered nursing home deserts.   Maintaining pharmacy services in rural towns can also be a challenge particularly when the only pharmacist in town nears retirement. When a communitys only pharmacy closes it creates a void and residents must adapt to find new ways to meet their medication needs. According to Causes and Consequences of Rural Pharmacy Closures A MultiCase Study   A 2015 rural policy brief from RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis Characteristics of Rural Communities with a Sole Independently Owned Pharmacy analyzed data to describe characteristics of vulnerable rural communities served by a sole independently owned rural pharmacy. Average characteristics of communities include   A 2022 RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis Brief states Between 2003 and 2021 the number of retail pharmacies declined in noncore rural areas by 9.8 percent and in rural micropolitan areas by 4.4 percent while the number in metropolitan areas increased by 15.1 percent during the same period. For more information on rural pharmacy access or challenges rural pharmacies face see RHIhubs Rural Pharmacy and Prescription Drugs topic guide.   There are multiple strategies being used to improve access to healthcare in rural areas. Examples include   In 2023 a new Medicare provider type will be implemented the Rural Emergency Hospital which is designed to maintain access to emergency and outpatient care in rural areas. For more information see the RHIhub Rural Emergency Hospital topic guide.   Freestanding Emergency Departments FSEDs are defined by the American College of Emergency Physicians ACEP as a facility that is structurally separate and distinct from a hospital and provides emergency care. ACEP provides FSED operational and staffing recommendations. A November 2016 Rural Monitor article Freestanding Emergency Departments An Alternative Model for Rural Communities further defines an FSED and describes the two types while discussing the financial sustainability of the model. After Hospital Closure Pursuing High Performance Rural Health Systems without Inpatient Care a June 2017 RUPRI Health Panel report discusses case studies from 3 rural communities that transitioned to new models of care including freestanding emergency department services increased telemedicine capacity and specialty care. The report also describes a range of different delivery options for communities that lack hospital inpatient care.   Community Paramedicine is a model of care where paramedics and emergency medical technicians EMTs operate in expanded roles to assist with healthcare services for those in need without duplicating available services existing within the community. RHIhubs Community Paramedicine topic guide describes how this model of care can benefit rural communities and covers steps to starting a rural community paramedicine program. Rural communities looking to develop community paramedicine or mobile integrated health programs can also view RHIhubs Rural Community Paramedicine Toolkit for emerging practices and resources.   The Community Health Worker CHW model facilitates healthcare access by using CHWs as a liaison between healthcare providers and rural residents to ensure their healthcare needs are met. RHIhubs Community Health Workers in Rural Settings topic guide offers information and resources on CHWs and covers CHW education training and certification.   Care coordination and teambased care models such as Accountable Care Organizations and PatientCentered Medical Homes PCMHs can also extend access to primary care services in rural communities. A variety of rural medical home and care coordination programs are highlighted in RHIhubs Rural Health Models and Innovations section.   Local rural healthcare facilities may choose to join healthcare networks or affiliate themselves with larger healthcare systems as a strategic move to maintain or improve healthcare access in their communities. These affiliations or joining of healthcare networks may improve the financial viability of the rural facility provide additional resources and infrastructure for the facility and allow the rural healthcare facility to offer new or expanded healthcare services they could not otherwise provide. However the benefits of an affiliation with a larger healthcare system may come at the expense of local control.   A 2018 RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis policy brief Trends in Hospital System Affiliation 20072016 notes that rural hospitals do follow the general trend and show an increase in hospital system affiliation. The brief found nonmetropolitan CAHs had the lowest rate of increase in hospital system affiliation. The 2018 RUPRI Center for Rural Health Policy Analysis report The Rural Hospital and Health System Affiliation Landscape A Brief Review discusses the various types of hospital affiliations that rural hospitals might consider and factors that might affect which option rural hospitals choose such as maintaining local decisionmaking authority and meeting the demands of the hospital system affiliation. The report covers some benefits hospital system affiliation can afford a rural hospital including access to   An adequate workforce is necessary for maintaining healthcare access in a community. In order to increase access to healthcare rural communities must use their healthcare professionals in the most efficient and strategic ways. This might include allowing each professional to work at the top of their license using new types of providers working in interprofessional teams and creative scheduling to offer clinic time outside of regular work hours.   RHIhubs Rural Healthcare Workforce topic guide discusses how rural areas can address workforce shortages such as partnering with other healthcare facilities increasing pay for staff adding flexibility and incentives to improve recruitment and retention of healthcare providers and using telehealth services. The guide also discusses state and federal policies and programs to improve the supply of rural health professionals such as loan repayment programs and visa waivers.   Telehealth is considered to be a key tool to help address rural healthcare access issues. Through telehealth rural patients can see specialists in a timely manner while staying in the comfort of their home or local facility. Local healthcare providers can also benefit from subspecialists expertise provided via telehealth. However the temporary changes to telehealth policy in response to the COVID19 pandemic has made visible potential for unequal access to these services due to a lack of broadband internet access in some rural areas. According to the Federal Communications Commission 2020 Broadband Deployment Report 22.3 of rural Americans and 27.7 of Americans living in tribal areas lack fixed terrestrial broadband coverage compared to 1.5 of Americans who lack coverage in urban areas.   For more information on telehealth policy including broadband capacity see the Rural Policy Research Institutes 2020 report The Evolving Landscape of National Telehealth Policies during a Public Health Emergency Responsiveness to Rural Needs. The report notes the RUPRI Health Panels recommendation that telehealth should support rather than supplant local healthcare services. Additionally the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has a telehealth guide that is specific to rural areas.   RHIhubs Telehealth and Health Information Technology in Rural Healthcare topic guide provides a broad overview of how telehealth is being used in rural communities to improve healthcare access. The guide covers specific programs currently in use in rural areas as well as providing resources and a listing of funding and opportunities that can be used to support telehealth solutions.   One of the primary barriers that rural veterans face when accessing healthcare services is the significant travel distance to the nearest Veterans Affairs VA healthcare facility. A 2018 study found that rural veterans access to healthcare is not necessarily an issue of eligibility for purchased care from nonVA providers as most VA healthcare facility deserts are also underserved by nonVA providers.   According to the 2019 research brief Access to Care Among Rural Veterans 56 of rural veterans enrolled in the VA health system are over 65 years of age and are more likely to experience diabetes heart conditions and high blood pressure compared to urban veterans. Moreover suicide rates are higher for rural compared to urban veterans. It is important that populations with complex medical needs have access to support programs.   To address access issues for rural veterans the VA has created communitybased outpatient clinics in many rural areas in addition to using mobile clinics and telehealth services. To learn more about VA services for rural veterans or the VAs efforts to address veterans healthcare access see RHIhubs Rural Veterans and Access to Healthcare topic guide.   Health and Health Care for American Indians and Alaska Natives AIANs a 2018 publication from the Kaiser Family Foundation reports that nonelderly AIAN adults are more likely to be uninsured compared to nonelderly White adults 25 and 8 respectively and that there are higher uninsured rates of AIAN children 14 compared to White children 4.   The federal Indian Health Service IHS provides healthcare and prevention services to AIAN people. Broken Promises Continuing Federal Funding Shortfall for Native Americans a 2018 report states that federal funding for Native American programs in the past 15 years has been severely inadequate and does not meet the basic needs and services of the federal governments obligations to the populations they serve which in itself is a barrier to accessing healthcare for AIAN people. IHS provides direct healthcare services at an IHS facility or PurchaseReferred Care PRC provided by a nonIHS facility or provider through a contractual agreement and these services are not considered healthcare insurance coverage. This is explained further in RHIhubs Rural Tribal Health topic guide question Is access to Indian Health Service IHS resources considered health insurance?   RHIhubs Rural Tribal Health topic guide answers frequently asked questions on tribal health and provides resources on rural AIAN populations.   Many organizations work to meet the needs of rural communities and help ensure the availability of essential healthcare services.   Many private foundations work to improve healthcare access by funding transportation services improving workforce and addressing other factors that affect rural healthcare access. Investing in existing safety net providers and programs offering grants to develop and implement innovative healthcare delivery models and funding research to study policy implications as they relate to rural healthcare access are all examples of actions foundations can take to support rural healthcare access.   A November 2017 article published in Health Affairs Foundations Efforts to Improve Rural Health Care covers private foundation projects focused on improving access to rural healthcare.   Grantmakers in Health offers multiple resources that provide education and guidance to foundations interested in improving rural healthcare access such as Improving Health Care Access Grantmakers Share Their Experiences and Improving Health Access in Communities Lessons for Effective Grantmaking.

The BidenHarris Administration is committed to improving health outcomes and promoting health equity in rural America. In 2021 thanks to President Biden s American Rescue Plan the Department of Health and Human Services invested over 16 billion to strengthen rural health.  The BidenHarris Administration is committed to ensuring all Americans have access to highquality affordable health care no matter where anyone lives said HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan we have significantly improved access to health care for the millions of families who live in rural America. Our work doesn t stop here with these funds we can continue working to ensure rural communities have the support they need.  Nearly 46 million in American Rescue Plan funding will support 31 awardees to expand health care capacity in rural and tribal communities through health care job development training and placement. This funding includes support for critical health workforce needs in rural areas such as dental hygienists medical or dental assistants communitybased doulas and other frontline health care workers. Nearly 10 million will support 13 organizations through the Rural Residency Planning and Development Program to establish new medical residency programs in rural communities to increase the number of physicians training in rural settings. In addition nearly 4 million will support 18 awards to improve patient health outcomes and quality and delivery of care throughout rural counties and improve access to care for rural veterans.  Among the most important steps we can take to improve access to health care in rural communities including access to behavioral health care is to invest in growing the rural health care workforce said HRSA Administrator Carole Johnson. Today s announcements are another important part of the Health Resources and Services Administration s strategy to advance health equity for the nearly 65 million people who call rural areas home.  Nearly one in five Americans lives in a rural area and rural communities are becoming even more diverse. However health disparities between rural and urban areas tripled between 1999 and 2019 with rural residents experiencing higher rates of heart disease respiratory disease cancer stroke unintentional injury and suicide and higher risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. Access to quality health care is at the heart of these issues.

The independent source for health policy research polling and news. Zachary Levinson Jamie Godwin and Scott HulverPublished Feb 23 2023 Policymakers have had ongoing concerns about the financial health of rural hospitals and the implications for access to care and the local economy. Rural hospital finances improved during the COVID19 pandemic as a result of government relief funds. However industry reports suggest that the outlook for the hospital sector as a whole deteriorated in 2022 as these funds have gone away and due to ongoing effects of the pandemic such as labor shortages rising prices and investment losses. Concerns about the viability of rural hospitals have been cited as one factor that could potentially motivate lawmakers to expand Medicaid in the eleven states that have not already done so. These nonexpansion states collectively account for about onethird 34 of rural hospitals based on our analysis of 2021 hospital cost report data. In this data note we provide a background on rural hospital finances and use hospital cost report data to describe operating margins among rural hospitals before and during the COVID19 pandemic see Methods for details. We find that median operating margins among the rural hospitals in our analysis increased earlier in the COVID19 pandemic likely as a result of government relief funds but that these facilities face renewed financial challenges especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid Figure 1. Among rural hospitals in nonexpansion states median operating margins were 2.1 percent during the July 2021June 2022 period and were 0.7 percent when excluding documented relief funds. In Medicaid expansion states median operating margins dropped but remained positive even after excluding documented relief funds. Rural hospitals have faced unique financial challenges that precede the COVID19 pandemic. Among other challenges rural hospitals tend to have low patient volumes given that they serve small populations and residents increasingly travel to urban facilities to receive their care which may lead to higher costs on average and may limit the ability of rural facilities to offer specialized services. From 2010 to 2019 114 rural hospitals eliminated inpatient services or closed altogether while others eliminated specific service lines such as obstetric units. According to our analysis in 2019 the year before the beginning of the COVID19 pandemic median operating margins were 1.5 among rural hospitals compared to more than threetimes that rate 5.2 among other hospitals data not shown. Although rural hospitals face a common set of challenges operating margins varied substantially across facilities. For example we found that about twofifths 41 of rural hospitals had negative operating margins in 2019 though about onethird 32 had operating margins at or above 5.0 in the same year data not shown. One previous study found that median margins on patient care are greater among large versus small rural hospitals though another analysis found that closures were less likely among Critical Access Hospitals rural facilities that are eligible for costbased reimbursement from Medicare on the basis of having 25 or fewer acute inpatient beds and either meeting distance requirements from the nearest hospital or being deemed a necessary provider by the state prior to 2006. The latter study also found that closures were more likely among forprofit hospitals Medicare Dependent Hospitals rural facilities that are eligible for greater Medicare reimbursement on the basis of having high Medicare inpatient shares and 100 or fewer beds hospitals in the South and hospitals in states that have not expanded Medicaid. Median operating margins among rural hospitals were higher in expansion than nonexpansion states in 2019 2.0 versus 0.3 based on our analysis data not shown which is consistent with research suggesting that expanding Medicaid has improved the financial performance of hospitals. The Affordable Care Act ACA expanded Medicaid coverage for most lowincome adults to 138 of the federal poverty level though a June 2012 Supreme Court decision effectively allowed states to decide whether to adopt the Medicaid expansion. Currently eleven states have not expanded Medicaid and they are largely in the South. Previous research has found that Medicaid expansion has resulted in decreases in uncompensated care increases in operating margins and decreases in closures of hospitals and obstetric units. Medicaid expansion improves hospital finances by extending coverage to uninsured patients who would otherwise qualify for hospital charity care or be unable to pay their bills. Among studies that have evaluated the effect of Medicaid expansion on urban and rural hospitals separately most reported that improvements in financial performance have been concentrated among rural hospitals. Although research suggests that expanding Medicaid has improved the financial performance of rural hospitals it may not be a panacea. For instance while median operating margins among rural hospitals were higher in expansion than nonexpansion states in 2019 2.0 versus 0.3 they were still lower than median operating margins among nonrural hospitals in expansion states 4.2 data not shown. The financial performance of rural hospitals improved substantially early in the pandemic likely as a result of government relief funds. Median operating margin among rural hospitals increased from 1.0 during July 2017June 2019 to 7.7 during July 2019June 2021 based on our analysis of a subset of hospitals see Methods for details. Rural hospital closures had been increasing since 2017 before peaking at 19 closures in 2020 the largest number since at least 2005 and then dropping to 2 closures in 2021 the smallest number since at least 2005. The large improvement in the financial performance of rural hospitals likely reflects the receipt of government relief funds including dollars that were targeted specifically towards rural hospitals. Subtracting out relief funds documented in hospital cost reports lowers median operating margins during July 2019June 2021 from 7.7 to 3.9 according to our analysis. It appears that some hospitals did not separately or completely report relief funds meaning that our estimates may overstate what operating margins would have been in the absence of relief funds and potentially substantially so. In other words relief funds likely played an even more substantial role in supporting rural hospital operating margins than suggested by our analysis. Rural hospitals now face renewed financial challenges. After increasing substantially earlier in pandemic median operating margins among the rural hospitals in our analysis fell from 7.7 in July 2019June 2022 to 3.3 in the July 2021June 2022 period. When subtracting out relief funds documented in hospital cost reports median operating margins were slightly lower than prepandemic levels during the July 2021June 2022 period and would likely have been even lower if accounting for relief funds that were not specifically documented by hospitals. Industry reports suggest that the outlook for hospitals and health systems deteriorated in 2022 which is only partially reflected in our analysis of July 2021June 2022 data. In this context it is not clear whether hospital closures may reemerge as an issue facing rural communities. There were seven hospital closures in 2022 which was greater than the number in 2021 2 closures but still less than the average number from 20052022 10.3. Median operating margins among rural hospitals were lower in nonexpansion states than in expansion states in each period of our analysis leaving these facilities in weaker financial standing to confront the challenges that have faced the hospital sector in recent months. For example during the July 2021June 2022 period median operating margins among rural hospitals in our analysis fell to 2.1 in nonexpansion states compared to 3.9 in expansion states and 0.7 when subtracting out documented relief funds compared to 1.2 in expansion states. There may be additional challenges for rural hospitals on the horizon. First key sources of COVID19 relief have been largely depleted. This includes Phase 4 Provider Relief Funds which were intended to be greater for smaller providers and American Rescue Plan ARP rural funds both of which may have helped sustain rural hospitals during July 2021June 2022. Second on March 31 2023 a provision will end that has required states to keep people in Medicaid continually enrolled during the pandemic in exchange for enhanced federal matching funds. A KFF analysis estimated that between 5 and 14 million people could lose Medicaid enrollment as a result which may increase uncompensated care costs for rural and other hospitals. Finally the Biden administration has announced plans to end COVID19 emergency declarations on May 11 2023. This would eliminate numerous health care policies and regulations that could have implications for hospital finances such as a 20 percent increase in the Medicare payment rate for hospitalized patients who are diagnosed with COVID19. Policymakers have implemented a number of initiatives that are intended to support rural hospitals or restructure the rural health care delivery system. For example in December 2022 Congress passed an omnibus spending bill that included a twoyear extension of Medicare payment adjustments targeted towards rural hospitals. The federal government also recently implemented a new payment model the Rural Emergency Hospital designation which provides additional resources intended to sustain emergency and outpatient services at facilities that may no longer be able to support inpatient care. Finally the Center for Medicare Medicaid Innovation CMMI is testing the Pennsylvania Rural Health Model which provides rural hospitals with an allpayer global budget and is intended to reduce costs increase quality and improve the sustainability of rural hospital finances. It is unclear whether current policy initiatives will be sufficient to sustain access to care in rural areas especially in states that have not expanded Medicaid where hospitals are facing greater financial challenges. Operating margins reflect the profit margins earned on patient care and other operations of a given hospital such as from gift shops parking and cafeterias. They are calculated by dividing the difference between operating revenues and expenses also known as net operating income by operating revenues. We excluded investment income and charitable contributions from operating revenues but included government appropriations which may be critical for sustaining the operations of some hospitals. We defined expansion and nonexpansion states differently based on the period of analysis. When analyzing 2019 data we defined expansion states to include all states that had expanded Medicaid through that year including Virginia which did so on January 1 and Maine which did so on January 10 with coverage retroactive to July 2 2018. We defined all remaining states as nonexpansion states except for Wisconsin which covers individuals up to 100 percent of the federal poverty level and therefore does not have a coverage gap. We began with the same set of states when analyzing July 2017June 2022 data but excluded seven states that expanded during that period Idaho Maine Missouri Nebraska Oklahoma Utah and Virginia. All analyses included South Dakota as a nonexpansion state given that it expanded Medicaid after our period of analysis. Our analysis of 2019 data included 2117 rural hospitals and 2179 urban hospitals and our analysis of trends included 527 rural hospitals i.e. 25 of all rural hospitals with 2019 data. When evaluating operating margins by expansion status we excluded hospitals from some states as described above leaving 2019 data for 1201 and 845 hospitals from expansion and nonexpansion states respectively and trend data for 305 and 133 hospitals respectively. For our trend analysis we focused on rural hospitals with July to June reporting periods given that this was the secondmost common reporting period and as of February 2023 RAND Hospital Data from 2022 were rarely available for the most common reporting period January to December. We also focused on hospitals with complete data from June 2017June 2022. We found similar patterns but different operating margins when evaluating the much larger group of hospitals with complete 20182021 data 1938 facilities or about 92 of all rural hospitals with 2019 data. Among those hospitals operating margins increased from 1.2 in 20182019 to 7.7 in 20202021 or 2.4 when excluding documented relief funds. Among the hospitals in our trend analysis operating margins increased from 1.0 in 20182019 to 7.7 in 20202021 or 3.9 when excluding documented relief funds. Median operating margins were also higher among hospitals in expansion versus nonexpansion states during the 20182019 and 20202021 periods when evaluating the larger group of hospitals with complete 20182021 data. The magnitude of this difference during the 20202021 period was smaller overall 8.3 among expansion states versus 6.5 among nonexpansion states compared to 8.5 versus 5.6 in our trend analysis but larger after removing documented relief funds 3.5 versus 0.0 compared to 4.9 versus 2.6 in our trend analysis.This work was supported in part by Arnold Ventures.
