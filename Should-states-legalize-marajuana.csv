https://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/, The use of medical marijuana dates to ancient civilizations though historians are undecided about whether the first medical use of cannabis was in China where the plant is indigenous. Archaeologists unearthed traces of cannabis with high levels of THC the main psychoactive component of cannabis in wooden bowls dating to 500 BCE in the Jirzankal Cemetery in China marking the earliest instance of marijuana use found to date. Read more history  Medical marijuana is most commonly used for pain in the US. While marijuana isn t strong enough for severe pain for example postsurgical pain or a broken bone it is quite effective for the chronic pain that plagues millions of Americans especially as they age explains primary care physician and cannabis specialist Peter Grinspoon. 22 Marijuana also offers pain relief for patients who are suffering the pain of multiple sclerosis or general nerve pain. In contrast with marijuana the commonly prescribed drugs for these ailments are often heavily sedating which can impair quality of life. 22 Marijuana particularly CBD the main nonpsychoactive component in cannabis has also shown potential to treat high blood pressure inflammation and related neuropathic pain anxiety disorders including generalized anxiety panic social anxiety obsessivecompulsive and posttraumatic stress disorders gastrointestinal GI disorders including irritable bowel syndrome IBS inflammatory bowel disease IBD Crohn s and ulcerative colitis epilepsy and other seizure syndromes as well as the prevention of drug and alcohol addiction relapse and alleviation of the effects of chemotherapy. 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30  Medical marijuana also includes drugs chemically derived from marijuana rather than only preparations of the plant itself. According to the National Institutes of Health THC itself has proven medical benefits in particular formulations. 31 In the US the FDA approved THCbased Marinol and Cesamet to treat nausea in chemotherapy patients and for appetite stimulation in AIDS patients. Also FDAapproved is the CBDbased Epidiolex which treats Dravet and LennoxGastaut syndromes in children. Sativex a THC and CBDbased drug for multiple sclerosis MS patients is approved for use in the UK Canada and some European countries. 31 The bottom line marijuana has been used as medicine for thousands of years. The drug should be legalized and studied to reap the full benefits. Many patients prefer marijuana for pain because it is less addictive and carries less risk of overdose than opiates. 22 32 Three researchers from the University of British Columbia BC Centre on Substance Use in Vancouver argue Although cannabis use is neither risk free nor a panacea the risks it poses of physical dependence and accidental overdose compared with opioid use are substantially lower indeed fatal overdose with cannabis has never been documented and is thought to be impossible. Especially in the era of the opioid overdose crisis the common sequelae results of opioid use disorder e.g. fatal overdose acquisition or transmission of bloodborne diseases are hardly comparable to those of cannabis use disorder at either individual or population levels. The lower relative risks associated with cannabis are reflected in substantially lower rates of cannabisassociated morbidity mortality and societal costs compared with opioids in Canada despite much higher levels of exposure. Simply put it is not perception that cannabis has fewer relative harms than opioids it is evidence. 33 Marijuana can also be used instead of NSAIDs Advil and Aleve for example if someone has kidney problems ulcers or gastroesophageal reflux disease GERD making it potentially safer for people with those conditions. 22 Studies also show many patients prefer to use marijuana instead of lorazepam clonazepam and alprazolam for anxiety disorders and instead of sertraline trazodone or bupropion for depression. 34 Widespread American approval of marijuana is seen in the many states that have legalized its use. Since California legalized medical marijuana in 1996 36 states and DC have followed suit as of December 2022. 19 Of those living in the United States 83.5 live in a state or DC with legal medical marijuana. Only 16.5 live in one of the 13 states without legal medical marijuana. 19 45 Additionally polls and elections for more than 20 years have shown Americans united on the legalization of medical marijuana. 35 Of 96 polls and elections collected by ProCon between 2000 and 2022 only three had less than 50 support for legalizing medical marijuana. Two were elections in South Dakota Nov. 2006 and Nov. 2010 however South Dakota legalized medical marijuana in 2020. 35 The third was a poll of 960 physicians nationwide by researchers at Rhode Island Hospital for presentation to the American Society of Addiction Medicine in Apr. 2001. The doctors were split fairly evenly 36 believed they should be able to legally prescribe medical marijuana 26 were unsure and 38 were against the practice. 35 However a 2021 study found 70.7 of physicians at the 2019 American College of Emergency Physicians Annual Conference believed that cannabis has medical value and further that 79.6 of the physicians would choose marijuana over opioids if cannabis were found to be more effective and 52.3 would choose marijuana if it were found to be equally as effective as opioids. 36 Approval of legalization crosses party lines as well as age and race demographics in what Pew Research Center deemed overwhelming support in an Apr. 16 2021 poll. Among Democrats 95 believed medical marijuana should be legal joined by 87 of Republicans. 21 92 of white Americans would legalize medical marijuana along with 91 of Black Americans 89 of Asian Americans and 87 of Hispanic Americans. 21 The largest support among age groups for medical marijuana comes from those aged 1829 94 and 6574 93. However no age group dropped below 85 approval those aged 75. 21 Medical marijuana enjoys so much support among Americans that many now approve of the legalization of recreational marijuana as well. 21 Whether medical marijuana is legalized for everyone or only adults legalization provides everyone more access to the drug. 38   An unintended consequence of marijuana legalization is the impact on the pediatric population. From prenatal exposure to unintentional childhood exposures through concerns of adolescence abuse and marijuana use for medicinal indications in children marijuana exposure can affect pediatric patients at every stage in childhood. Regardless of the stage or reason of exposure concerns exist about shortterm and longterm consequences in a child s physical and mental health argues Sam Wang Associate Professor of PediatricsEmergency Medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. 39  Adult use of marijuana medical or otherwise during pregnancy can cause child development problems during and after pregnancy. If exposed to marijuana before birth children may be more susceptible to increased hyperactivity impulsivity and inattention symptoms and problems with visualmotor coordination processing speed and visual memory. 31 39 40 41  Any drug at home poses potential risks for children but medical marijuana edibles look like regular treats gummy bears hard candies and chocolate bars to name a few yet are infused with potent marijuana. And unlike a regular treat a marijuana infused edibles should be carefully portioned for the correct dosage. A child accidentally eating an entire marijuana candy bar could overdose and end up in serious medical distress. Within just five years accidental cannabis exposures in kids aged one to six who ate edibles increased 1375 from 207 cases in 2017 to 3054 in 2021. 39 42 47  The danger does not decrease as children age. According to the National Institutes of Health heavy chronic marijuana consumption in young people under the age of 25 has been associated with decreased cognitive and executive function. Researchers are not yet certain whether the damage is permanent but one New Zealand study found teens who smoked marijuana heavily and developed a marijuana use disorder lost 8 IQ points on average between ages 13 and 38. 40 The National Institutes of Health offers a litany of negative mental side effects including altered senses for example seeing brighter colors altered sense of time changes in mood impaired body movement difficulty with thinking and problemsolving impaired memory hallucinations when taken in high doses delusions when taken in high doses and psychosis risk is highest with regular use of high potency marijuana. 40 Physical side effects include breathing problems such as daily cough and phlegm more frequent lung illness and a higher risk of lung infections an increased heart rate which in turn increases the risk of heart attack and Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome regular cycles of severe nausea vomiting and dehydration sometimes requiring emergency medical attention . 40 Further between 9 and 30 of people who use marijuana are at risk of developing a substance use disorder. And with THC levels steadily increasing the potential for addiction only grows as users need more and more marijuana to feel the desired effects. 40 43 Colorado legalized medical marijuana in 2000 and recreational marijuana in 2012. The state saw a 40 increase in cannabisrelated emergency room ER visits between 2012 and 2014. Colorado hospitals have seen a 50 increase in marijuanarelated cyclic vomiting syndrome. Burn admissions also increased. 44 However these are the known side effects. Because the drug has not been studied as thoroughly as other drugs there may be unexpected consequences to medical marijuana use. 44 Decriminalizing recreational marijuana means possession of a small amount for personal use does not carry the risk of arrest jail time or a criminal record but instead are ticketed like a minor traffic violation according to NORML National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws which reports 26 states have partially or fully decriminalized recreational marijuana. 46 However the medical benefits and safety of marijuana have not been studied enough to determine if the benefits outweigh the risks associated with the drug. Additional study also allows more specificuse analysis for example does a particular marijuana derivative help a particular ailment and does marijuana treat a condition not yet associated with the drug?. 38 Sarah C. Hull cardiologist at Yale School of Medicine explains why we should not rush into legalization of medical marijuana Decriminalization of marijuana will create significant opportunities to conduct this research but commonsense regulation based on science must be implemented simultaneously to create an ethical policy framework. This should aim to promote public health through comprehensive education programs and protection of vulnerable populations such as adolescents while recognizing the right of autonomous adults to make decisions about their own health but not to act in a way that might compromise the health of others. 38 Hull argues further that significant criminal penalties should not be attached to adult possession or use of marijuana as such punishments have entrenched systemic racism. 38 She concludes There is substantial need for more research to guide specific policy development going forward and in the meantime recreational use though not medicinal use should be generously taxed to fund research efforts as well as addiction treatment in order to enhance benefits to society. 38 As with any drug marijuana should be thoroughly studied for medical applications before being widely used as medicine. Once we understand on the brain level what effect it is having on cognition then we can see how it can be applied for all sorts of purposes but first we need to know exactly what it s doing. If it s going to be introduced to society in a big way we need to know what the potential harms and benefits are argues Earl Miller cognitive neuroscientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology s Picower Institute for Learning and Memory. 44 ProConEncyclopaedia Britannica Inc.325 N.

For decades people who used cannabis were subject to social ostracization and criminal prosecution. However attitudes toward cannabis have been evolving in recent years. An increasing number of states have started to legalize cannabis for medical or recreational use. This shift in policy has been driven by a variety of factors including changing public attitudes and the potential economic benefits of legalization. In this article we will explore the potential benefits of legalizing cannabis in our country.  Legalizing cannabis can have significant benefits for the environment. When cannabis is grown illegally it is often done in environmentally damaging ways such as using chemical pesticides or clearing primary forests to make room for crops. Legalization could allow customers to support more environmental growers. This will incentivize more responsible growing practices such as the use of organic farming methods or the use of renewable energy sources to power indoor grow operations. In addition the culture of growing cannabis can help to discover and preserve precious marijuana seeds increasing biodiversity and facilitating a deeper understanding of cannabis plants and their cultivation. Where cannabis is illegal people are being arrested and charged for possession or sale which leads to costly court cases and a burden on the criminal justice system. Legalization would free up law enforcement resources to focus on more serious crimes and simultaneously reduce the number of people incarcerated for nonviolent drug offenses. This could help to reduce the overall prison population and save taxpayers money.  In addition legalization can have significant benefits for justice and equity particularly for marginalized communities that have been disproportionately affected by the criminalization of cannabis. Communities of color have been particularly affected by the war on drugs with Black Americans being nearly four times more likely to be arrested for cannabis possession than white Americans despite similar rates of use. By regulating cannabis cultivation and sales legalization can help to eliminate the black market and reduce the involvement of criminal organizations in the cannabis industry. This can lead to safer communities and reduced drugrelated violence in communities that have been most affected by the criminalization of cannabis. Cannabis has been shown to have many beneficial and therapeutic effects on both physical and mental health. However people may be hesitant to seek medical marijuana treatment due to fear of legal repercussions if cannabis is illegal. Legalization can allow more people to enjoy better health outcomes. It can also promote the safer use of cannabis by educating the public on appropriate cannabis use and providing quality control measures for cannabis products. Legalization can also lead to increased research into potential medical applications of cannabis and could lead to the development of innovative treatments. Another potential perk of cannabis legalization is that it could reduce the use of more harmful drugs. In the absence of cannabis people may turn to more dangerous drugs like heroin or fentanyl to manage chronic pain or other conditions. By legalizing cannabis we can provide a safer alternative for these individuals and could reduce the overall demand for these more dangerous drugs. States that have legalized cannabis found a decrease in opioid overdose deaths and hospitalizations suggesting that cannabis are an effective alternative to prescription painkillers. The legalization of cannabis can generate significant tax revenue for governments and create new economic opportunities. When cannabis is illegal it is sold on the black market and no taxes are collected on these sales. However when it is legal sales can be regulated and taxes can be imposed on those sales. In states that have legalized cannabis tax revenue from cannabis sales has been in the millions of dollars with California registering a whopping 1.2 billion in cannabis tax revenue in 2021. This impressive income can be used to reduce budget deficits fund various public services such as education and healthcare and create new opportunities for investment in projects that revitalize the economy. Aside from tax revenue legalizing cannabis can create new jobs. The cannabis industry is a rapidly growing industry and legalization could lead to the creation of new jobs in areas such as cultivation processing and retail sales. This can help to reduce unemployment and create new gainful opportunities for people who may have struggled to find employment in other industries. Legalization can also lead to increased investment in related industries such as the development of new products or technologies to improve cannabis cultivation or the creation of new retail businesses. There are now several venture capital funds and investment groups that focus solely on cannabisrelated enterprises. Finally legalization could help reduce the stigma surrounding cannabis use. Before cannabis legalization people who use the plant were often viewed as criminals or deviants. Legalization can help change this perception and lead to more open and honest conversations about cannabis use. Ultimately legalization could lead to a more accepting and inclusive society where individuals are not judged or discriminated against for their personal and healthcare choices. By legalizing cannabis we can harness the power of a therapeutic plant. Legalization can heal not just physical and mental ailments of individuals but also the social wounds that have resulted from its criminalization. Your email address will not be published.

https://www.investopedia.com/articles/insights/110916/economic-benefits-legalizing-weed.asp, Mrinalini Krishna is the Senior Editor of investing news at Investopedia. She s been a journalist for more than 10 years covering business personal finance and investing news.  Over the past several years states have been voting to decriminalize marijuana making it legal for both medicinal and recreational purposes and also making it a big business. Taking a leaf out of Colorado or Washington s book four states New Jersey South Dakota Montana and Arizona passed measures in 2022 to make marijuana consumption for recreational purposes legal. Mississippi also voted to allow medical marijuana.  Still state legislation remains heavily divided on the topic. Since the 2020 election South Dakota Circuit Judge Christina Klinger ruled that the measure was unconstitutional. In November 2021 the South Dakota Supreme Court agreed and ruled against pot legalization. On the other hand Arizona has collected more than 284 million of tax revenue since the legalization of marijuana in the state.  All told more and more states are moving to legalize marijuana whether for medicinal or recreational use or both. The legal changes have spawned a burgeoning industry of legal cannabis companies including those that aim to research and develop cannabisbased medical products those that are working to distribute and grow marijuana and many others. But there are still some holdouts. In the 2022 midterm elections for instance two states voted to legalize marijuana Maryland and Missouri while three states voted down ballot measures to do so North Dakota South Dakota and Arkansas.  Following the 2022 midterms in November 37 states allow the use of medical cannabis products with 21 states and the District of Columbia allowing the use of nonmedical cannabis products for personal or recreational consumption. More states are continuing to propose new legislation to encourage legal activity. For instance Delaware is circulating HB 305 a bill that would make marijuana legal for adults.  At the federal level things are also looking more progressive. In October 2022 President Biden pardoned all prior federal offenses of simple possession of marijuana and asked the Justice Department to review the current classification of marijuana as a Schedule I controlled substance. These efforts could pave the way to nationwide decriminalization in the near future.  The economic benefits of legalizing weed have already been apparent as the first states have moved to change their legal positions. Overall legal marijuana could mean a big push for state economies and big bucks for both the state and the federal governments. Though state law and federal law remain divided on the issue. let s explore some of the key economic benefits of legal marijuana.  Betterthanexpected sales of marijuana in Colorado and Washington over the past several years have resulted in buoyant tax revenues. In 2021 Washington collected 559.5 million of legal marijuana revenue over 85 million more revenue than 2020. Meanwhile Colorado collected 423 million of marijuana tax revenue in 2021 up almost 10 from the year prior.  In 2019 total tax revenue collected by all states topped 1.7 billion. Two years later the total dollar revenue had more than doubled. Aggregate revenue for all states hit 3.7 billion for legal adultuse cannabis sales and this does not include revenue generated for statewide budgets cities and towns. In addition six states that have approved marijuana use had not started collecting marijuana tax revenue in 2021.  Should marijuana become legal on a federal level the benefits to the economy could be exceptional A report from cannabis analytics company New Frontier suggests that federally legal pot could generate an additional 105.6 billion in aggregate federal tax revenue by 2025. Colorado began collecting marijuana tax revenue in 2014. In 2021 its totaltodate collections have surpassed 2 billion.  Setting up marijuana nurseries and dispensaries would be the first step for the states that voted in favor of medical marijuana. These would not only create jobs but also set the ball rolling for economic activity in the pot industry in these areas. In the case of states like California and Nevada where such infrastructure already exists the economic impact has become more quantifiable as the sector has matured.  An RCG Economics and Marijuana Policy Group study on Nevada says that legalizing recreational marijuana in the state could support over 41000 jobs till 2024 and generate over 1.7 billion in labor income. The ICF study estimates at least 81000 additional direct indirect and induced jobs in California as a result of legalized marijuana sales. It also projects an increase in total labor income by at least 3.5 billion.  New Frontier s report predicting the impact of federally legal marijuana suggests that nationwide legalization could generate 1 million jobs by 2025. These jobs would likely come from the quickly growing industry that would spring up across the nation. Workers would be needed to farm process distribute and sell marijuanabased products.  Further there would be ample opportunities for secondary industries that are related to legal cannabis although not directly involved in its production and distribution. These might include software developers financing services construction companies and many others.  Legal marijuana presents the possibility of tremendous benefits to economies on a local and a national scale. It also could help to secure the investment portfolios of investors across the country and further afield as well. While marijuana remains illegal on the federal level it is difficult for investors to capitalize on the growth of the industry.  The number of marijuanarelated companies trading on public stock exchanges is minuscule and while investors do have the option of working with overthecounter exchanges many of the most successful businesses in the early legal cannabis space have been based in Canada or other countries.  Should marijuana become legal on the national level marijuana companies would be free to list their stocks on all U.S. exchanges thereby enhancing liquidity and opening up access to many more investors. Should the growth rates for the cannabis space continue as they have in recent years its likely that investors would express a keen interest in the industry. As of 2022 the largest marijuana exchangetraded fund ETF was AdvisorShares Pure US Cannabis ETF MSOS with over 1 billion of assets under management.  When considering the economic benefits of legal marijuana it s important to think of the money that might be saved as well as revenue that could be generated through such a process. Currently federal marijuana enforcement costs several billion dollars per year. A 2013 report by the American Civil Liberties Union found that the costs at that time were approximately 3.6 billion per year.  The more states that legalize cannabis the lower the cost of enforcement would likely be if marijuana were to be legalized on a national level these costs would likely drop considerably. If marijuana were removed from the list of controlled substances far fewer court cases involving the substance would go to trial resulting in fewer incarcerations and in turn more money saved.  Legalized marijuana also stands to benefit medical consumers of cannabisbased products. As marijuana becomes legal in more and more parts of the country its likely that the price will drop overall as a result of commoditization.  This may not immediately seem like good news for overall tax revenue or for marijuana companies looking to maximize profits. However individuals utilizing marijuanabased products for medical treatment would stand to benefit considerably from lower prices for these items. As of 2022 37 states have legalized the medical use of marijuana with 21 of those allowing recreational use as well. The District of Columbia Guam Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands also allow medical use by qualified individuals. In 2021 the states that legalized marijuana for personal consumption generated 3.7 billion in annual tax revenue. This revenue does not include city revenue or proceeds distributed to smaller municipalities. States that legalize marijuana have recognized various economic benefits. There are direct tax proceeds generated for the state. States employ thousands of employees of oversee the production distribution and management of the sector. There are also potential savings to the legal enforcement of the substance if certain criteria are no longer considered illegal.  There is ample pushback against the idea of legalizing marijuana across the country. Critics cite the potential for confusion among law enforcement officers aiming to keep up with shifting regulations a concern about increased homelessness or youth use of the substance the potential for decreased property values and much more. Some are opposed to changing the regulatory status of marijuana simply because it means a change to the status quo.  All of these reasons combine to decrease the likelihood that marijuana will become legal at a national level any time soon. However as more and more states move to individually decriminalize cannabis use in various ways and as the economic benefits of a legal marijuana industry take effect there are also many compelling reasons to consider nationwide legalization.

https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2023/risks-and-benefits-of-legalized-cannabis, Research is still needed on cannabis s risks and benefits.   Although the use and possession of cannabis is illegal under federal law medicinal and recreational cannabis use has become increasingly widespread.  Thirtyeight states and Washington D.C. have legalized medical cannabis while 23 states and D.C. have legalized recreational use. Cannabis legalization has benefits such as removing the product from the illegal market so it can be taxed and regulated but science is still trying to catch up as social norms evolve and different products become available.  In this Q A adapted from the August 25 episode of Public Health On Call Lindsay Smith Rogers talks with Johannes Thrul PhD MS associate professor of Mental Health about cannabis as medicine potential risks involved with its use and what research is showing about its safety and efficacy.   Do you think medicinal cannabis paved the way for legalization of recreational use? The momentum has been clear for a few years now. California was the first to legalize it for medical reasons in 1996. Washington and Colorado were the first states to legalize recreational use back in 2012. You see one state after another changing their laws and over time you see a change in social norms. Its clear from the national surveys that people are becoming more and more in favor of cannabis legalization. That started with medical use and has now continued into recreational use. But there is a murky differentiation between medical and recreational cannabis. I think a lot of people are using cannabis to selfmedicate. Its not like a medication you get prescribed for a very narrow symptom or a specific disease. Anyone with a medical cannabis prescription or who meets the age limit for recreational cannabis can purchase it. Then what they use it for is really all over the place maybe because it makes them feel good or because it helps them deal with certain symptoms diseases and disorders. Does cannabis have viable medicinal uses? The evidence is mixed at this point. There hasn t been a lot of funding going into testing cannabis in a rigorous way. There is more evidence for certain indications than for others like CBD for seizures one of the first indications that cannabis was approved for. And THC has been used effectively for things like nausea and appetite for people with cancer. There are other indications where the evidence is a lot more mixed. For example pain one of the main reasons that people report for using cannabis. When we talk to patients they say cannabis improved their quality of life. In the big studies that have been done so far there are some indications from animal models that cannabis might help with pain. When we look at human studies its very much a mixed bag.  And when we say cannabis in a way its a misnomer because cannabis is so many things. We have different cannabinoids and different concentrations of different cannabinoids. The main cannabinoids that are being studied are THC and CBD but there are dozens of other minor cannabinoids and terpenes in cannabis products all of varying concentrations. And then you also have a lot of different routes of administration available. You can smoke vape take edibles use tinctures and topicals. When you think about the explosion of all of the different combinations of different products and different routes of administration it tells you how complicated it gets to study this in a rigorous way. You almost need a randomized trial for every single one of those and then for every single indication. What do we know about the risks of marijuana use?  Cannabis use disorder is a legitimate disorder in the DSM. There are unfortunately a lot of people who develop a problematic use of cannabis. We know there are risks for mental health consequences. The evidence is probably the strongest that if you have a family history of psychosis or schizophrenia using cannabis early in adolescence is not the best idea. We know cannabis can trigger psychotic symptoms and potentially longer lasting problems with psychosis and schizophrenia.  It is hard to study because you also dont know if people are medicating early negative symptoms of schizophrenia. They wouldnt necessarily have a diagnosis yet but maybe cannabis helps them to deal with negative symptoms and then they develop psychosis. There is also some evidence that there could be something going on with the impact of cannabis on the developing brain that could prime you to be at greater risk of using other substances later down the road or finding the use of other substances more reinforcing.  What benefits do you see to legalization? When we look at the public health landscape and the effect of legislation in this case legalization one of the big benefits is taking cannabis out of the underground illegal market. Taking cannabis out of that particular space is a great idea. Youre taking it out of the illegal market and giving it to legitimate businesses where there is going to be oversight and testing of products so you know what youre getting. And these products undergo quality control and are labeled. Those labels so far are a bit variable but at least were getting there. If youre picking up cannabis at the street corner you have no idea whats in it.  And we know that drug laws in general have been used to criminalize communities of color and minorities. Legalizing cannabis can help reduce the overpolicing of these populations. What big questions about cannabis would you most like to see answered? We know there are certain mostoftenmentioned conditions that people are already using medical cannabis for pain insomnia anxiety and PTSD. We really need to improve the evidence base for those. I think clinical trials for different cannabis products for those conditions are warranted. Another question is now that the states are getting more tax revenue from cannabis sales what are they doing with that money? If you look at tobacco legislation for example certain states have required that those funds get used for research on those particular issues. To me that would be a very good use of the tax revenue that is now coming in. We know for example that there s a lot more tax revenue now that Maryland has legalized recreational use. Maryland could really step up here and help provide some of that evidence. Are there studies looking into the risks you mentioned? Large national studies are done every year or every other year to collect data so we already have a pretty good sense of the prevalence of cannabis use disorder. Obviously well keep tracking that to see if those numbers increase for example in states that are legalizing. But you wouldnt necessarily expect to see an uptick in cannabis use disorder a month after legalization. The evidence from states that have legalized it has not demonstrated that we might all of a sudden see an increase in psychosis or in cannabis use disorder. This happens slowly over time with a change in social norms and availability and potentially also with a change in marketing. And with increasing use of an addictive substance you will see over time a potential increase in problematic use and then also an increase in use disorder. If youre interested in seeing if cannabis is right for you is this something you can talk to your doctor about? I think your mileage may vary there with how much your doctor is comfortable and knows about it. Its still relatively fringe. That will very much depend on who you talk to. But I think as providers and professionals everybody needs to learn more about this because patients are going to ask no matter what.

https://marijuana.procon.org/history-of-recreational-marijuana/, Pot. Weed. Ganja. Mary Jane. There are more than a thousand slang terms in the English language to refer to marijuana. A 1943 article in TIME magazine called it muggles mooter and bambalacha and referred to marijuana cigarettes as goofbutts and gigglesmokes. According to the Oxford English Dictionary use of the word marijuana also written as marihuana in older references came to popularity in the United States in the 1930s as an alternative to the more familiar terms cannabis and hemp. 88 89 90 Cannabis the scientific name for marijuana is a plant that has three species or strains cannabis indica cannabis sativa and the less common cannabis ruderalis. Marijuana and hemp are both cannabis plants but marijuana contains higher levels of THC delta9tetrahydrocannabinol the primary psychoactive ingredient that causes people to get high. Hemp can be cultivated for industrial uses such as rope and burlap fabric or for a lowTHC nonpsychoactive medicinal product. The words cannabis and marijuana are frequently used interchangeably as are the words recreational and adultuse. 33 123245 Marijuana legalization refers to the practice of allowing and regulating the production distribution sale and possession of cannabis so that marijuana use within the established rules is no longer a crime. There are different models of legalization including allowing people to grow their own marijuana nonprofit coops and forprofit commercialization with retail sales. 33 143150  Early History of Cannabis in the United States While references to marijuana as a popular medicine are found in Chinese writings dating back to 2900 BC the marijuana plant made its arrival in North America in 1611 thanks to the Jamestown settlers. Early colonists were required to grow hemp. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson grew hemp for clothing rope and fishing nets in the 1770s. By the 1800s doctors were using cannabis extracts for various ailments and marijuana was listed in the United States Pharmacopeia as a treatment for opiate addiction leprosy cholera and more. In the mid1800s hemp was the thirdlargest crop in the United States behind cotton and tobacco. 99 121 177 178 182 183 246  Trend towards Outlawing Marijuana Early 1900s At the start of the 20th century drugs were largely unregulated beverages including CocaCola contained cocaine heroin was sold as an overthecounter medicine and cannabis was readily available in tinctures. The 1906 Pure Food and Drug Act which specifically mentioned cannabis indica kicked off drug regulation in the United States by requiring ingredient labeling in drugs and food. The 1914 Harrison Narcotics Act which regulated and taxed opiates and cocaine was soon followed by the 1918 prohibition of alcohol. 189190 191 192  Mexican immigrants entered the United States in record numbers following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. They reportedly introduced Americans to smoking marijuana for recreational purposes. Around the same time sailors and West Indian immigrants brought marijuana from the Caribbean into North America via New Orleans. In the 1920s and 1930s recreational cannabis use became associated with the jazz music and the famous trumpet player Louis Armstrong was an early advocate for marijuana. 179 187188  The rise of the word marijuana from the Spanish marihuana as a replacement for the thenfamiliar terms cannabis and hemp is often attributed to prohibitionists including Harry Anslinger the first commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics. Anslinger worked to associate cannabis with demeaning or racist stereotypes about Mexican immigrants and other minorities. 155 163 169 175 179 184 193 198  Following the 1933 repeal of alcohol prohibition Anslinger focused on fighting marijuana which had already been banned in 29 states by 1931. He tried to turn public opinion against cannabis with inflammatory rhetoric There are 100000 total marijuana smokers in the U.S. and most are Negroes Hispanics Filipinos and entertainers. Their Satanic music jazz and swing result from marijuana use. This marijuana causes white women to seek sexual relations with Negroes entertainers and any others. His efforts were aided by a 1936 antimarijuana propaganda film Reefer Madness as well as by newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst who famously printed articles designed to foster fear of the drug. 169194 195196197198  The 1937 Marihuana Tax Act effectively outlawed cannabis use in the United States by adding strict regulations and prohibitive taxes that made marijuana too expensive to buy or sell legally. It became a federal crime to possess marijuana including hemp without having the required tax stamps. Importers and manufacturers of marijuana were required to pay an annual tax of 24 more than 400 in 2018 dollars. Transfers of marijuana to nonregistered people were subject to a tax of up to 100 per ounce more than 1700 in 2018 dollars. Legal transfers of marijuana involved special order forms and strict record keeping. Violations of the Act were subject to fines of up to 2000 34260 in 2018 dollars and five years in prison. In October 1937 Samuel Caldwell became the first marijuana seller convicted under US federal law and he was sentenced to four years of hard labor at Leavenworth Penitentiary. 178 194 199 200 201 202 203 204 205  In 1938 New York City Mayor Fiorella LaGuardia directed the New York Academy of Medicine to research marijuana. Their report became one of the first comprehensive reviews of the drug s impact. The 1944 LaGuardia report concluded that The practice of smoking marihuana does not lead to addiction Marihuana is not the determining factor in the commission of major crimes The publicity concerning the catastrophic effects of marihuana smoking in New York City is unfounded. The findings infuriated Commissioner Anslinger who denounced the report as a governmentprinted invitation to youth and adults above all teenagers to go ahead and smoke all the reefers they feel like. The report did not alter federal marijuana policy. 206 207 208 209 210  Marijuana remained popular with musicians artists writers and others throughout the 1940s and 1950s. However marijuana use became more widespread among uppermiddle class white Americans and common on college campuses in the 1960s alongside the rise of the hippie counterculture and Vietnam war protests. Efforts to relegalize marijuana grew stronger. The 1965 arrest of Timothy Leary a Harvard psychologist who experimented with hallucinogens and became a counterculture icon led to the Marihuana Tax Act being overruled by the Supreme Court in 1969. The court agreed with Leary s argument that the law violated his fifth amendment right against selfincrimination because he wouldn t have been able to follow the law s registration requirements without admitting to breaking state marijuana bans thus incriminating himself. 33 177 194 209 211  President Nixon and the 1970 Controlled Substances Act In 1970 President Nixon signed the bill that makes marijuana illegal under federal law to this day. As a party to the 1961 Single Convention Treaty the United States was required to limit marijuana use exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. That obligation was implemented with the 1970 Controlled Substance Act CSA. Under the CSA drugs were put into one of five categories based on their medical use and potential for abuse. Marijuana was placed in the most restrictive category Schedule I which was designated for drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse along with heroin and LSD. Drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine were placed in the less restrictive Schedule II. 139 177 209 212 213  Marijuana s placement in Schedule I was supposed to be temporary pending a federal review by the newly formed National Commission on Marihuana and Drug Policy more commonly known as the Shafer Commission. The commission s 1972 report concluded that neither the marihuana user nor the drug itself can be said to constitute a danger to public safety and recommended that marijuana possession for personal use no longer be considered a criminal offense. President Nixon s response was Reading it did not change my mind. I oppose the legalization of marijuana. Regardless of the commission s recommendation marijuana was left in Schedule I and remains there today. 169 214 224 225 226 The same year that the CSA was enacted 1970 the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws NORML was founded to advocate for the end of marijuana prohibition. Between 1973 and 1981 the organization successfully fought to get minor marijuana offenses decriminalized in 11 states and lower penalties for marijuana possession in other states. The organization headquartered in D.C. is still in operation. 217 209  A policy of decriminalization was adopted in the Netherlands in 1976 for what the country deemed soft drugs which included cannabis. Under the Dutch Opium Act possession of less than five grams of marijuana is presumed to be for personal use and is therefore not prosecuted. The law also allows for coffee shops where people are able to buy and use cannabis. Decriminalization of marijuana means people don t get arrested for possessing small amounts of marijuana but instead may be required to pay a civil fine rather than facing criminal charges. This is a step towards loosening marijuana prohibition but is not considered to be legalization. Some marijuana legalization opponents advocate for decriminalization instead. 216 218 219  In the 1980s a rise in parent groups concerned about the increase in teen drug use coincided with the election of President Ronald Reagan who declared a war on drugs in 1982 echoing the phrase popularized by Nixon. First Lady Nancy Reagan spearheaded the Just Say No campaign aimed at convincing kids not to use drugs and seeking to overturn lenient drug laws. Parent lobbying groups such as the National Federation of Parents for DrugFree Youth now known as National Family Partnership established a presence in D.C. to advocate for antidrug legislation. Throughout the 1980s federal and state criminal penalties for marijuana became stricter and mandatoryminimum sentences were established. 169 177 220 221 222 223  Marijuana arrests increased dramatically in the 1990s more than doubling between 1990 and 2002 from 327000 to 697000 annually. In New York City marijuana arrests jumped 882 in that period. A report from the Sentencing Project stated Our analysis indicates that the war on drugs in the 1990s was essentially a war on marijuana. At the same time public opinion was shifting in favor of medical marijuana. In 1996 California became the first state to legalize marijuana for medical purposes when voters passed Proposition 215. By the end of 2000 eight states had legalized medical marijuana. By 2017 29 states and Washington DC had legalized the drug for medical use. 227 Recreational Marijuana Legalization at the StateLevel Although a 2010 California proposition to legalize adultuse marijuana failed measures to legalize recreational marijuana were on the ballots in three states two years later in Nov. 2012. While Oregon voters turned down the measure Colorado and Washington became the first two U.S. states to legalize adultuse marijuana. 228 229 230 231 232  Support for legalizing recreational marijuana increased as more people including many who never tried marijuana believed that marijuana use was not as dangerous as the government reported and not a gateway to using hard drugs. People were also becoming unhappy with the sheer cost of enforcing marijuana laws and the growing prison populations especially among minority populations. Plus more people were exposed to marijuana and outintheopen marijuana users thanks to liberalized marijuana policies in medical marijuana states. Younger generations were increasingly more likely to support legalization. 180 215  In Nov. 2014 Oregon and Alaska passed recreational marijuana ballot measures following the same model as Washington and Colorado which is a forprofit commercial marijuana industry that allows retail sales. That same year Washington DC voters approved an initiative that allowed home cultivation and personal possession but not retail sales. 143 235 236 237 238  In the Nov. 2016 election California Maine Massachusetts and Nevada all passed legal recreational ballot measures that follow the commercialization model although retail sales in Maine were put on hold by the state legislature. 239 241 240 242  In Jan. 2018 Vermont became the first state to legalize marijuana by way of the state legislature rather than by ballot initiative enacting a law that did not allow for retail sales. 243 244  Four states legalized recreational marijuana in the Nov. 2020 election Arizona Montana New Jersey and South Dakota. Two states also legalized medical marijuana Mississippi and South Dakota with the latter being the first state to legalize both medical and recreational marijuana in the same election though a court battle ending on Nov. 24 2021 would rule recreational marijuana still illegal in the state because of the way the ballot initiative was written. Taken as a whole all six marijuana measures on the ballot in the Nov. 2020 election passed. Steve Hawkins JD Executive Director of the Marijuana Policy Project stated With the passage of these initiatives onethird of the population now lives in jurisdictions that have legalized cannabis for adult use and 70 of all states have embraced cannabis for medical use. 256 265  Recreational marijuana was on Nov. 8 2022 midterm ballots in five states Arkansas Maryland Missouri North Dakota and South Dakota. The measures failed in three Arkansas North Dakota and South Dakota. Maryland and Missouri became the 20th and 21st states to legalize marijuana for adult use. 270 271 272 273 274 Federal Response to States Legalization Concerns about how the federal government would react to the new laws were lessened somewhat with a 2013 communication from President Obama s Justice Department known as the Cole memo. Deputy Attorney General James M. Cole stated that as long as states had good regulations then the federal government would hold off on challenging marijuana legalization. As a result marijuana retail stores opened in Colorado on Jan. 1 2014 allowing adults 21 and older to purchase cannabis that is taxed and regulated under state law. Washington s marijuana shops opened on July 8 2014. 209 233 234  The election of President Trump in 2016 and his appointment of Jeff Sessions as U.S. Attorney General in 2017 raised new questions about whether the federal government would crack down on states that were legalizing adultuse marijuana. On Jan. 4 2018 Sessions issued a memo that undid the handsoff policy enacted by the Obama Administration and instructed federal prosecutors to determine for themselves when to prosecute marijuana activities. 176 181  On June 7 2018 Senators Elizabeth Warren DMA and Cory Gardner RCO introduced the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment through Entrusting States STATES Act which they said ensures that each State has the right to determine for itself the best approach to marijuana within its borders. Asked about the legislation President Trump said I support Senator Gardner. I know exactly what he s doing. We re looking at it. But I probably will end up supporting that yes. The bill did not advance. 247 248  President Trump signed the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 known as the Farm Bill into law on Dec. 20 2018. This law legalized industrial hemp that contains less than 0.3 THC by removing it from the Controlled Substances Act. Cannabidiol CBD and tetrahydrocannabinol THC remain federally illegal to include in food or health products without FDA approval even if they were derived from hemp. 253  On Dec. 4 2020 the US House passed a marijuana decriminalization bill 228164 that would remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act as well as add a 5 tax on marijuana to help people most affected by marijuana criminalization and to fund community and small business grants. Though the bill did not pass the Republicancontrolled Senate it was the first time either chamber has passed such an act. The legislation was led by Representative Jerry Nadler DNY with Senator and VicePresidentelect Kamala Harris DCA. 257  In a largely partisan vote the US House of Representatives voted 220 to 204 to decriminalize marijuana on Apr. 1 2022. Tom McClintock RCA Brian Mast RFL and Matt Gaetz RFL crossed party lines to support the bill while Henry Cuellar DTX and Chris Pappas DNH voted against decriminalization. If passed by the Senate the bill will prevent federal agencies from denying federal workers security clearances for cannabis use and will allow the Veterans Administration to recommend medical marijuana to veterans living with posttraumatic stress disorder plus gains revenue by authorizing a sales tax on marijuana sales and expunge the record of people convicted of nonviolent cannabis offenses. However neither the House bill nor a similar bill in the Senate garnered enough Republican votes to be passed. 267  On Oct. 6 2022 President Joe Biden announced he would pardon thousands of people with federal and DC marijuana simple possession convictions and review marijuana s federal drug scheduling. In a Twitter thread on potus and video on whitehouse Biden stated Sending people to jail for possessing marijuana has upended too many lives for conduct that is legal in many states. That s before you address the clear racial disparities around prosecution and conviction. Today we begin to right these wrongs. I d also like to note that as federal and state regulations change we still need important limitations on trafficking marketing and underage sales of marijuana. As I ve said before no one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana. Today I m taking steps to end our failed approach. Biden continued No one should be in jail just for using or possessing marijuana. It s legal in many states and criminal records for marijuana possession have led to needless barriers to employment housing and educational opportunities. And that s before you address the racial disparities around who suffers the consequences. While white and Black and brown people use marijuana at similar rates Black and brown people are arrested prosecuted and convicted at disproportionate rates. The White House Twitter account added Additionally POTUS asked SecBecerra and the Attorney General to initiate the process of reviewing how marijuana is scheduled under federal law. Marijuana is currently classified at the same level as heroin and above fentanyl. 268 269  A letter dated Aug. 29 2023 from the Department of Health and Human Services to Anne Milgram Administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration DEA was leaked to Bloomberg News. The letter calls for rescheduling marijuana as a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act. The DEA confirmed receipt of the letter to Bloomberg News and indicated that the department would now conduct its own review based on the recommendation. Marijuana is currently a Schedule I drug grouped with heroin LSD and ecstasy. Schedule III drugs like ketamine may be obtained with a prescription. 275  As of Dec. 15 2021 three countries have fully legalized recreational marijuana Malta 2021 Canada 2018 and Uruguay 2013. Luxembourg plans to legalize according to a statement released on Oct. 22 2021. 258 261 264 266  In a handful of other countries including but not limited to Georgia Mexico and South Africa adultuse marijuana is decriminalized meaning possession and consumption of marijuana are legal but selling or buying is illegal. Some countries with decriminalized marijuana allow cultivation others do not. 259 260 262 263  People who view this page may also like1. Should the drinking age be lowered from 21 to a younger age2.

https://marijuana.procon.org/, More than half of US adults have tried marijuana despite it being an illegal drug under federal law. Recreational marijuana also known as adultuse marijuana was first legalized in Colorado and Washington in 2012. Pot. Weed. Ganja. Mary Jane. There are more than a thousand slang terms in the English language to refer to marijuana. A 1943 article in TIME magazine called it muggles mooter and bambalacha and referred to marijuana cigarettes as goofbutts and gigglesmokes. According to the Oxford English Dictionary use of the word marijuana also written as marihuana in older references came to popularity in the United States in the 1930s as an alternative to the more familiar terms cannabis and hemp. Read more history  People buying marijuana on the street have no way of knowing if what they re ingesting is covered with mold fungus pesticides or other harmful substances. Once marijuana is legalized the government is able to enforce laboratory testing and regulations to ensure that marijuana is free of toxins. For example Washington law requires health warnings quality assurance labeling for the concentration of THC and other important regulations for consumers. 9 10 11 Further legalization comes with regulations to prevent kids exposure to marijuana including childresistant packaging such as the regulations implemented in Colorado Washington Oregon and Alaska. Legalization allows the government to set age restrictions on buyers and to license and regulate the entire supply chain of marijuana including growers distributors retailers and testing laboratories. California regulations include limitations on the serving sizes for edible marijuana products seedtosale testing and tracking and 24hour video surveillance at retail stores. 12 13 14 Due in part to these regulations the rates of marijuana use by young people are falling despite the fact more US states are legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana use and the number of adults using the drug has increased. Marijuana use among 8th graders in Washington state decreased following legalization in 2012 from 9.8 percent to 7.3 percent in 20142016 according to a Dec. 2018 report from RAND. A study from the Centers for Disease Control CDC found that pastyear marijuana use decreased by 17 from 15.8 in 2002 to 13.1 in 2014 among US kids ages 12 to 17. Colorado teens between 12 and 17 years old reported a nearly 12 drop in marijuana use just two years after adult use was legalized according to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health. The Marijuana Policy Project an organization that leads marijuana legalization campaigns said Study after study has confirmed that marijuana policy reforms do not cause rates of youth marijuana use to increase . The most indepth state surveys suggest modest decreases in rates of youth marijuana use in Colorado and Washington. 37 38 39 40 41 42 254  Additionally traffic deaths dropped 11 on average in states that legalized medical marijuana. In fact studies show that drivers under the influence of marijuana tend to be more cautious and take fewer risks than drunk drivers such as making fewer lane changes and reducing speed. A fact sheet about marijuana s effects on drivers posted on the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration website stated that Some drivers may actually be able to improve performance for brief periods by overcompensating for selfperceived impairment. Benjamin Hansen an economics professor at the University of Oregon at Eugene who studied traffic deaths postmedical marijuana legalization concludes Public safety doesn t decrease with increased access to marijuana rather it improves. 25 65 66 74 The fact of the matter is that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and tobacco which are already legal. Alcohol and tobacco are known to cause cancer heart failure liver damage and more. According to the CDC six people die from alcohol poisoning every day and 88000 people die annually due to excessive alcohol use in the United States. There are no recorded cases of death from marijuana overdose. 46 47 168 Three to four times as many Americans are dependent on alcohol as on marijuana. A study in the Lancet ranking the harmfulness of drugs put alcohol first as the most harmful tobacco as sixth and cannabis eighth. A national poll found that people view tobacco as a greater threat to health than marijuana by a margin of four to one 76 vs. 18 and 72 of people surveyed believed that regular use of alcohol was more dangerous than marijuana use. In several respects even sugar poses more of a threat to our nation s health than pot said Dr. David L. Nathan a clinical psychiatrist and president of Doctors for Cannabis Regulation. 33 43 44 48 Arresting people for marijuana possession costs the United States between 1.19 billion and 6.03 billion annually. These costs include police judicial legal and corrections expenses. Incarcerating marijuana offenders costs the United States an estimated 600 million per year. Harvard economist Jeffrey Miron has estimated that marijuana legalization would save between 7.7 billion and 13.7 billion annually. 21 24 60 61 63 Instead of arresting people for marijuana police officers could focus on serious crimes including rape assault and homicide. For example marijuana legalization in Washington significantly freed up law enforcement resources marijuana possession arrests dropped from 5531 the year before legalization to 120 the year after. Howard Wooldridge a former police detective from Michigan who cofounded LEAP Law Enforcement Against Prohibition said Marijuana prohibition is a horrible waste of good police time. Every hour spent looking for pot reduces public safety. 62 64 169 Further statistics show a significant racial disparity in the enforcement of marijuana laws even though white and black people use marijuana at roughly the same rate a black person in the United States is 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession on average. In Iowa the state with the highest inequity black people are 8.3 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people. In New York City 15.8 of marijuana possession cases involving white people result in conviction compared to 32.3 involving black people and 30 involving Hispanic people. Marijuana possession convictions can impact people s ability to get public housing financial aid for school loans and jobs. Margaret DooleySammuli Criminal Justice and Drug Policy director for the ACLU of California stated Racial disparities in marijuana enforcement are widespread and longstanding. 26 Legalizing marijuana would help correct the disparity. 21 24 27 28 Legalizing recreational marijuana would also subvert the illegal marijuana market. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol shows that marijuana seizures have decreased by millions of pounds and are at their lowest levels in over a decade indicating that legal domestic production is decreasing demand for marijuana smuggled in from Mexico. A Mexican cannabis farmer told NPR If the US continues to legalize pot they ll run us into the ground. Legalization in Colorado and Washington alone has cost Mexican drug cartels an estimated 2.7 billion in profits. 17 18 19 21 Finally studies show that medical marijuana dispensaries decreased crime in their neighborhoods because of an increased security presence and more people walking around the area. Research also indicates that people drink less and alcohol sales drop in places where marijuana is legalized which in turn decreases crime because the amount of crime and violence caused by alcohol use is ten times higher than by marijuana use and alcohol is a factor in around 40 of violent crimes including domestic violence and assault. According to FBI crime statistics violent crime in Washington decreased in the years after legalization 295.6 violent offenses reported per 100000 Washington residents in 2011 vs. 284.4 violent offenses per 100000 people in 2015. 30 31 32 33 35 36 Taylor West former deputy director for the National Cannabis Industry Association said We re not seeing any increase in crime rates through marijuana we re seeing lower crime rates and there are good rational reasons for that We re really beginning to cripple the criminal market which is where violence actually occurs. 71 For every 1.00 spent in the marijuana industry between 2.13 and 2.40 in economic activity is generated for other industries including but not limited to tourism banking real estate construction and transportation. While 2017 estimates suggested the marijuana industry adultuse and medical in the United States could exceed 24 billion in revenue by 2025 the industry hit 24.6 billion in revenue in 2021 exceeding the market for energy drinks milk and orange juice. 1 2 3 7 278 In Colorado marijuana brings in three times more tax revenue than alcohol. The state raised 78 million in the first fiscal year after starting retail sales and 129 million the second fiscal year. Washington collected a total of 220 million in tax revenues in its second fiscal year of sales. 15 52 53 The legal marijuana industry generated 7.2 billion in economic activity in 2016 and added millions of dollars in federal taxes paid by cannabis businesses. A study on adultuse marijuana in Nevada projected 7.5 billion in economic activity over the first seven years of legalization in that state including 1.7 billion in labor income. A study by the University of California Agricultural Issues Center estimated that the legal marijuana market in California could generate 5 billion annually. 4 5 6 20 In addition to creating tax revenue legalizing marijuana creates jobs. As of Jan. 2022 the legal marijuana industry had created 428059 American jobs with 107000 new jobs in 2021 alone according to the Leafly Jobs Report. The report noted that jobs increased 33 from 2020 to 2021 or approximately 280 new jobs per day. 2021 was the fifth consecutive years jobs increased by more than 27. 278 An economic impact estimate from the Marijuana Policy Group forecast the creation of more than 130000 jobs in California following legalization. Within a few years of legalization approximately 18000 additional fulltime jobs were created in Colorado annually both in the actual marijuana business as well as in related fields such as security and real estate. U.S. Representative Earl Blumenauer DOR stated that the cannabis industry in the United States is expected to produce nearly 300000 jobs by 2020 and grow to 24 billion by 2025. 15 20 59 Further all of the tax revenue in legal marijuana states provide funding to the police drug treatment and mental health centers and housing programs along with school programs such as antibullying campaigns youth mentoring and public school grants. The impact is really felt at the local level. Some counties have done 20 years of infrastructure work in just one year s time. They ve provided lunch for kids who need it says Brian Vicente partner at Vicente Sederberg LLC a law firm specializing in the marijuana industry. 40 50 73 In Colorado 40 million of marijuana tax revenue went to public school construction while 105 million went to housing programs mental health programs in jails and health programs in middle schools in 20162017. 51 52 A 2022 Gallup poll found 59 support for legalizing marijuana among American adults up from 12 in 1969 the first year the polling company asked about marijuana. The poll first surpassed 50 support in 2011. 249 276 According to Gallup the transformation in public attitudes about marijuana over the past halfcentury has mirrored the liberalization of public attitudes about gay rights and the samesexmarriage movement. While Democrats 73 have been more likely to back legalization historically 45 of Republicans overall agree with legalization. However 62 of younger Republicans 18 to 29 support legalization for recreational use. 67 276 NORML which lobbies for marijuana legalization states Most Americans agree with NORML that responsible marijuana consumers should not be treated like criminals. Eight in ten Americans support the medical use of marijuana and twothirds of adults favor legalizing marijuana for adults. As evidence 40 states took some action to relax their drug laws such as decriminalizing or lowering penalties for possession between 2009 and 2013. And as of Jan. 31 2023 DC and 21 states had legalized recreational marijuana while DC and 37 states had legalized medical marijuana. 69 70 277 Marijuana use harms more than just the person using the drug. Societal costs of marijuana use include paying for increased emergency room visits medical care and addiction treatment for the uninsured more victims of drugged driving accidents and workplace accidents. Legalizing marijuana would put one more harmful substance in our society that costs more than the revenue it generates. 78 102 129 130 133 After retail marijuana stores opened in Colorado emergency room ER visits related to marijuana shot up nearly 30 and hospitalizations related to marijuana rose 200. The emergency department has seen increased visits for primary care needs breathing problems related to inhalation of marijuana including asthma bronchitis upper respiratory tract infections as well as psychiatric needs accidental or intentional overdoses and unfortunately increased pediatric patients with issues related to marijuana said Karen Randall an ER physician in Colorado. Further people end up in the ER with anxiety attacks or psychoticlike symptoms from eating sweets infused with more marijuana than they were expecting or in some cases not expecting at all. People are used to the idea that a candy bar is a single serving size but a candy bar with marijuana could have four or more times the recommended dose of THC depending on the state s regulations. As a result poisoncontrol marijuana exposure cases for kids ages 9 and under increased more than fivefold in Colorado after legalization. 12 78 100 102 104 105 161 171 255 According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse as many as four million Americans meet the diagnostic criteria for a marijuana use disorder such as abuse dependence or addiction. Dr. Drew Pinsky a boardcertified internist and addiction medicine specialist said I ve been treating cannabis addiction for 20 years. When people are addicted to cannabis cocaine and alcohol the drug they have the most difficult time giving up is the cannabis. 93 A study in the Journal of Drug Issues found that the number of US daily marijuana users has risen dramatically since 2002 and now 68 of users report daily or neardaily use. 98 Kevin Sabet director of Smart Approaches to Marijuana wrote The scientific verdict is that marijuana can be addictive and dangerous Many baby boomers have a hard time understanding this simply because today s marijuana can be so much stronger than the marijuana of the past. 93 95 96 97 160 Marijuanarelated traffic deaths rose 62 following the legalization of marijuana in Colorado. Jim Leal former Chief of Police of Newark California said of legalizing marijuana You are commercializing a product that is just going to put more impaired drivers on the road worsening a problem that we already have. What officers are seeing with THC levels being very high is they are seeing impairment being far worse than they have ever seen in the past. The Highway Loss Data Institute found an increased crash risk in legal marijuana states and said collision claims in Colorado Nevada Oregon and Washington increased 6 as compared to states that don t have legal marijuana. A metastudy by the National Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine NAS concluded that Cannabis use prior to driving increases the risk of being involved in a motor vehicle accident. 78 83 84 85 158 252 255 Workplace incidents involving employees under the influence of marijuana increased from 6 to 20 the year after legalization in Colorado. Employees who screened positive for marijuana use had 55 more industrial accidents 85 more injuries and absenteeism rates 75 higher than those who tested negative according to a study done on postal workers. Paul L. Bittner partner and vice chair of the Labor and Employment Group at Ice Miller law firm said You not only lose productivity but the bigger concern for employers is potential liability if there s an accident and someone gets hurt or killed. 122 124 125 126 134 According to a 2021 review Results show that both indoor and outdoor cannabis growing is waterintensive. The high water demand leads to water pollution and diversion which could negatively affect the ecosystem. Studies found out that cannabis plants emit a significant amount of biogenic volatile organic compounds which could cause indoor air quality issues. Indoor cannabis cultivation is energyconsuming mainly due to heating ventilation air conditioning and lighting. Energy consumption leads to greenhouse gas emissions. Cannabis cultivation could directly contribute to soil erosion. Meanwhile cannabis plants have the ability to absorb and store heavy metals. 279 Additionally marijuana cultivation results in deforestation habitat destruction and river diversion. 140 142 Cannabis plants require nearly double the amount of water needed to grow grapes or tomatoes. Rosamond Naylor Senior Fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment said Taking water directly from rivers and streams in the summer to grow marijuana not only reduces the water available for agriculture but also threatens wildlife species Regardless of the legal status of marijuana the way we are currently managing its impacts on water and wildlife in California just doesn t work. 142 144 145 142 144 145 Because remains an illegal drug at the federal level the United States Environmental Protection Agency EPA has not approved any pesticides for use on the plant. This lack of guidance has resulted in some growers using banned pesticides and blood thinnersrat poisons against cropeating mammals and not properly disposing of chemicals and waste. Further growing marijuana results in a number of waste streams including waste similar to food manufacturers agricultural waste mercurycontaining waste as a result of UV light use toxic and flammable waste from THC extraction chemicals. Uneducated growers or those without statesupported guidelines may be destroying their local environments. 280 Legal indoor growing also requires a lot of electricity for lighting heating and ventilation. These heavyload electric devices include UV lights that are powered on 16 or more hours daily irrigation systems HVAC air conditioning and heating systems and air filter systems. In just three years after legalization Denver growers doubled their electric use accounting for almost 5 of the 2.8 million city residents power use. 280  Derek Smith executive director of the nonprofit Resource Innovation Institute explains The reality is this industry has been in the shadows for a long time and thus many newly legal growers are using in some cases the same technology that was used in basements in the black market days just blown up to 50000 square feet very hot lights very inefficient HVAC very little ventilation. 181 Not only do old and new technologies seriously strain an already stuggling power grid but the energy consumption from growing marijuana also produces an amount of greenhouse gas emissions equal to that of 3.3 million cars each year. As a Jan. 2022 Mother Jones article jabs Dude your cannabis habit has an epic carbon footprint. The article notes Studying more than 1000 locations across the United States researchers from Colorado State University calculated the median emissions of growing one kilogram of cannabis to be about 3600 kilograms of CO2 equivalent emissions. The amount varies from roughly 2300 to 5200 kilograms of emissions per kilogram grown depending on location. To put that in perspective a kilogram of tomatoes grown in a British Columbia Canada greenhouse heated with natural gas emits roughly two kilograms. 141 282  Big Marijuana is already using similar tactics to Big Tobacco which marketed cigarettes using ads that appealed to kids including the Joe Camel cartoon character. Marijuana food products are frequently colorful sweet or branded with cartoons to attract children. Marijuana is available in kidfriendly forms such as gummy bears and lollipops and products sometimes resemble familiar brands such as Buddahfinger or KeefKat in wrappers that look like a Butterfinger or KitKat candy bar. 103 129 134 149 167 Mark A. R. Kleiman a drug policy expert said If you re in the forprofit cannabis business casual users aren t much use to you while heavy users are your best customers accounting for the bulk of your sales . The commercial interest demands maximizing problem use. Rosalie Liccardo Pacula senior economist at RAND Corporation agrees noting heavy marijuana users account for the vast majority of the total amount sold andor consumed. 147 148 The percentage of 12 to 17yearolds using marijuana is higher in every legal marijuana state than the national average. For example 16.21 of Colorado teens and 18.86 of teens in Alaska reported marijuana use in the past year compared to an average of 12.29 for the United States overall in 20152016. Colorado pastmonth teen marijuana use jumped 20 in the twoyear average after marijuana was legalized for adults. 39 78 Further creating a commercialized legal market has actually enhanced opportunities for the illegal market because prices charged by statelicensed sellers can easily be undercut by cartels. A drug dealer told Vice News Right now with the way the tax structure is in Washington the black market is going to thrive. 134 135 173 In Colorado a sharp increase in marijuanarelated charges filed under the state s Organized Crime Control Act coincided with the legalization of marijuana indicating a rise in organized crime. The Colorado Attorney General s office stated that legalization has inadvertently helped fuel the business of Mexican drug cartels cartels are now trading drugs like heroin for marijuana and the trade has since opened the door to drug and human trafficking. Local officials said that Mexican cartels were growing marijuana under the cover of legal operations in Colorado and using that to fuel the black market in other states. 102 134 174 Additionally three United Nations treaties set worldwide drug controls. As a party to the treaties the United States has agreed to limit the use of marijuana exclusively to medical and scientific purposes. The move by some U.S. states to legalize adultuse marijuana has upset the U.N. monitoring organization which stated that legalization cannot be reconciled with the legal obligation to uphold the Single Convention treaty. Legalizing marijuana puts the United States in a position of weakness when we need to hold other nations accountable to legal agreements. 136 137 138 139 Smoking marijuana can damage lung tissues and cause respiratory problems secondhand marijuana smoke is also dangerous. Research shows that smoking one marijuana joint is as damaging to the lungs as five tobacco cigarettes. Marijuana may contain five times as much carbon monoxide concentration and three times as much tar as tobacco. There is a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes in the hours immediately after smoking cannabis. And vaping is also dangerous and likely leads to enhanced ingestion of toxic ammonia known to result in neurobehavioral impairment. Ammonia ingested while vaping can result in lung irritation nervous system effects and asthma attacks. 114 115 116 118 119 120 134 162 164114 115 116 118 119 120 134 162 164 Some of the public health associations that oppose legalizing marijuana for recreational use include the American Medical Association the American Society of Addiction Medicine the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and the American Academy of Pediatrics. 94 151 152 153 154 The American Medical Association continues to oppose legalization of cannabis. Legalization of cannabis for adult use is associated with increased traffic fatalities exposures reported to poison control including infants and children emergency department visits and cannabisrelated hospitalizations. 275 Did You Know?1. The English language has more than one thousand slang words for marijuana including pot weed ganja and Mary Jane. A 1943 article in TIME magazine called it muggles mooter and bambalacha and referred to marijuana cigarettes as goofbutts and gigglesmokes. 88 902.

https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/11/22/americans-overwhelmingly-say-marijuana-should-be-legal-for-medical-or-recreational-use/, An overwhelming share of U.S. adults 88 say either that marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use by adults 59 or that it should be legal for medical use only 30. Just oneinten 10 say marijuana use should not be legal according to a Pew Research Center survey conducted Oct. 1016 2022. These views are virtually unchanged since April 2021. The new survey follows President Joe Biden s decision to pardon people convicted of marijuana possession at the federal level and direct his administration to review how marijuana is classified under federal law. It was fielded before the Nov. 8 midterm elections when two states legalized the use of marijuana for recreational purposes joining 19 states and the District of Columbia which had already done so. Pew Research Center asked this question to track public views about the legal status of marijuana. For this analysis we surveyed 5098 adults from Oct. 1016 2022. Everyone who took part in this survey is a member of the Center s American Trends Panel ATP an online survey panel that is recruited through national random sampling of residential addresses. This way nearly all U.S. adults have a chance of selection. The survey is weighted to be representative of the U.S. adult population by gender race ethnicity partisan affiliation education and other categories. Read more about the ATP s methodology. Here are the questions used for this report along with responses and its methodology. Over the long term there has been a steep rise in public support for marijuana legalization as measured by a separate Gallup survey question that asks whether the use of marijuana should be made legal without specifying whether it would be legalized for recreational or medical use. This year 68 of adults say marijuana should be legal matching the recordhigh support for legalization Gallup found in 2021. There continue to be sizable age and partisan differences in Americans views about marijuana. While very small shares of adults of any age are completely opposed to the legalization of the drug older adults are far less likely than younger ones to favor legalizing it for recreational purposes. This is particularly the case among those ages 75 and older just threeinten of whom say marijuana should be legal for both medical and recreational use. Larger shares in every other age group including 53 of those ages 65 to 74 say the drug should be legal for both medical and recreational use. Republicans are more wary than Democrats about legalizing marijuana for recreational use 45 of Republicans and Republicanleaning independents favor legalizing marijuana for both medical and recreational use while an additional 39 say it should only be legal for medical use. By comparison 73 of Democrats and Democratic leaners say marijuana should be legal for both medical and recreational use an additional 21 say it should be legal for medical use only. Ideological differences are evident within each party. About fourinten conservative Republicans 37 say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use compared with a 60 majority of moderate and liberal Republicans. Nearly twothirds of conservative and moderate Democrats 63 say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use. An overwhelming majority of liberal Democrats 84 say the same. There also are racial and ethnic differences in views of legalizing marijuana. Roughly twothirds of Black adults 68 and sixinten White adults say marijuana should be legal for medical and recreational use compared with smaller shares of Hispanic 49 and Asian adults 48. Related Clear majorities of Black Americans favor marijuana legalization easing of criminal penalties While Republicans and Democrats differ greatly on whether marijuana should be legal for medial and recreational use there are also age divides within each party. A 62 majority of Republicans ages 18 to 29 favor making marijuana legal for medical and recreational use compared with 52 of those ages 30 to 49. Roughly fourinten Republicans ages 50 to 64 41 and 65 to 74 38 say marijuana should be legal for both purposes as do 18 of those 75 and older. Still wide majorities of Republicans in all age groups favor legalizing marijuana for medical use. Even among Republicans 65 and older just 17 say marijuana use should not be legal even for medical purposes. While majorities of Democrats across all age groups support legalizing marijuana for medical and recreational use older Democrats are less likely to say this. About half of Democrats ages 75 and older 51 say marijuana should be legal for medical or recreational purposes larger shares of younger Democrats say the same. Still only 8 of Democrats 75 and older think marijuana should not be legalized even for medical use similar to the share of all other Democrats who say this.

https://marijuana.procon.org/should-recreational-marijuana-be-legal-pro-con-quotes/,  It is past time to safely legalize adult cannabis use prohibition doesn t work . Legalizing adultuse cannabis is about our economic future. It s about expanding our economy and creating jobs across the state. It s about health allowing us to regulate the industry and to ensure that products are safe and educating the public about the facts of cannabis use. It s about public safety allowing law enforcement to focus on violent crime and expunging the records of people who are convicted of nonviolent offenses involving cannabis to give them a second chance. It s about recognizing the way that we have been doing things isn t working and we can change.  Kyle Jaeger Minnesota Governor Proposes Marijuana Legalization and Expungements Funding in Budget Request marijuanamoment.net Jan. 24 2023  The strongest argument for Congress to end federal marijuana prohibition finds its roots in the far reaching harms and disparities that stem from its criminalization. The nation s misguided war on drugs will continue inflicting harm until cannabis is decriminalized. Nonetheless decriminalization alone is not enough. Given the risks associated with marijuana the nation needs the federal government to shift its posture from prohibition to regulation. To make that shift effectively Congress needs to take a handson approach. USA Today Editorial Board Time for Change Federal Ban on Marijuana Use Causes More Harm than Good usatoday.com July 31 2022  Something else it s past time we get done is dismantling the failed war on drugs starting with legalizing marijuana Between 2001 and 2010 more than seven million people were arrested for simple possession of marijuana. They are disproportionately black and brown. One stark example during the first three months of 2018 93 percent of the people the NYPD arrested for marijuana possession were people of color. These racial disparities are staggering and unconscionable. We need to legalize marijuana and regulate it. And we need to expunge nonviolent marijuanarelated offenses from the records of the millions of people who have been arrested and incarcerated so they can get on with their lives.  Kamala Harris The Truths We Hold An American Journey 2019 Jody Murphy Democratic candidate for Governor of West Virginia stated  We need to legalize the growth cultivation sale possession and use of cannabis both medicinal and recreational We can generate millions of dollars in muchneeded state revenue that people will willingly pay for. This is a huge untapped revenue stream  We need to get past the moral objection to marijuana. We to need understand and separate the fact that legalization of marijuana is not the same as individuals condoning it. This is a tax a revenue stream willingly paid by folks and will reap benefits for our working class folks and their families and our economy.  Jody Murphy The Reluctance to Tax the Willing registerherald.com Jan. 8 2020  For decades communities of color were disproportionately affected by the unequal enforcement of marijuana laws. Last year we righted that injustice when we decriminalized possession. This year let s work with our neighbors New Jersey Connecticut and Pennsylvania to coordinate a safe and fair system and let s legalize adult use of marijuana.  Andrew Cuomo State of the State Address governor.ny.gov Jan. 9 2020  There is no doubt in my mind that the federal government should not be in the marijuana prohibition business. It s making us less safe it s costing taxpayers too much money it s violating our values. From every perspective a libertarian perspective fiscal conservative s perspective Christian evangelical perspective progressive perspective marijuana prohibition is just wrong I am not going to be silent on this issue especially when I can see as the only senator that lives in a lowincome innercity community the damage that has been done over decades of a failed war on drugs  This war on drugs is a war on people and not all people It s a war on poor people on mentally ill people on addicted people and on people of color  I have never smoked marijuana I have never smoked a cigarette I have never eaten marijuana This to me is not an issue I come at through my own experimentations. I come at this as an issue of justice as an issue of safety for our communities as an issue of utter fairness.  Cory Booker Cory Booker Explains Why He s Making Legal Weed His Signature Issue vice.com Oct. 17 2017 Cynthia Nixon actress and 2018 gubernatorial candidate in New York stated  I believe it s time for New York to follow the lead of eight other states and DC and legalize recreational marijuana We have to stop putting people of color in jail for something that white people do with impunity. 80 of the New Yorkers who are arrested for marijuana are black or Latino despite the fact that whites and people of color use marijuana at roughly the same rates. The consequences follow people for the rest of their lives making it harder to get jobs or housing and for noncitizens putting them in the crosshairs for deportation. In addition to ending a key front in the racist war on drugs regulating and taxing marijuana would generate hundreds of millions of dollars of tax revenues for our people and create important agricultural opportunities for our state.  Karen O Keefe Director of State Policies at the Marijuana Policy Project MPP stated  Taxing and regulating marijuana allows for control which is a far better approach than prohibition for marijuana consumers workers communities and the environment.  Only in a regulated system can the government ensure marijuana is tested for dangerous pesticides and contaminants. Regulation also allows for environmental and worker protections When marijuana is prohibited it is often grown in environmentally sensitive locations where streams are diverted toxic waste is left behind and illegal rodenticides enter the food chain and poison predators including endangered animals. Relegating marijuana to the illicit market leaves workers vulnerable to sexual assault wage theft violence and felony charges.  With regulation governments control where marijuana is sold when it is sold and to whom it is sold. They decide what types of products to allow and many ban products likely to appeal to minors and how cannabis must be packaged and labeled. Regulators can also require information be disseminated with cannabis and can fund honest education campaigns to educate marijuana consumers and youth about making healthy decisions. Ending marijuana prohibition also frees up law enforcement resources allowing police to focus on crimes with victims rather than fighting an unwinnable 80yearold war against a substance that is safer than alcohol.  Josh Hamilton CoFounder and EditorinChief at The Jist in a Sep. 26 2017 article for medium.com titled The Economic and Social Benefits of Taxing Marijuana wrote  There is no way to argue with the cold hard facts of the economic boom that states such as Colorado and Washington have experienced since the legalization and taxation of recreational marijuana  As of September 2015 weed in Colorado was generating almost double the amount of tax revenue when compared to alcohol 70 million to 42 million. Similarly in Washington the first year of legalization racked up an incredible 82 million in tax revenue. Colorado has spent the money on a number of programs aimed at improving the standards of education and health in the state. These include school construction marijuana education antibullying campaigns public school grants youth mentoring drug abuse and treatment and grants to the Future Farmers of America. All of this has been paid for by the legalization of cannabis over a year in 1 state.  Josh Hamilton The Economic and Social Benefits of Taxing Marijuana medium.com Sep. 26 2017 Rick Steves television host travel writer and cosponsor of Initiative 502 which legalized recreational marijuana in the state of Washington stated  Seventythousand people are locked up in our country every year 700000 people are arrested for possession of marijuana nonviolent crimes they re not rich white guys they re poor people and they re black people  We ve got to take the crime out of the equation and treat marijuana as a health challenge and an education challenge. Marijuana is a drug. It s not good for you it can be abused. And it s here today and it s going to be here tomorrow. What we need to do is take that black market down and turn it into a highly regulated and highly taxed legal market so that we can gain credibility and focus on the real risk to young people in our society which is hard drug abuse  It s 2017. We know what happens when we legalize marijuana for adult recreational use. Use does not go up teen use does not go up DUIs don t go up crime doesn t go up. The only thing that goes up is tax revenue. In my state Washington we have 300 million dollars this year in tax revenue  We ve taken a black market which was empowering and enriching organized crime and games and we ve dismantled it. We ve turned it into a highly regulated highly taxed legal market employing 26000 people especially in rural areas where we can use the employment. We ve been able to redirect precious law enforcement resources away from petty pot issues and on to serious crime.  Rick Steves press conference at the James R. Thompson Center facebook.comIllinoisNORML Nov. 28 2017 Jill Gaebler President ProTem of the City Council in District 5 Colorado Springs stated  The worst consequence of the marijuana black market is that the safety of our children is imperiled. A black marketer will sell marijuana to our children. A licensed and taxpaying retailer will not. They will not jeopardize their livelihood.  This proof and other proof readily available from the Colorado Health Department s website clearly shows that teen marijuana use dips after legalization and that Colorado youths obtain 3 percent of their marijuana from a family member and 2 percent of it with their own MMJ card. That implies that 95 percent of their marijuana is coming from the black market.  And a black marketer sells other drugs too. Inevitably a customer requesting his usual ounce of pot will instead be offered heroin or meth. A legal and licensed business by contrast will always provide the requested product. When was the last time you went to a liquor store and were told they were out of beer but how about some opioids? Let s be absolutely honest The gateway to other drugs is not marijuana it s prohibition.  Jill Gaebler PointCounterpoint Should Colorado Springs Legalize Recreational Marijuana Sales? gazette.com Aug. 20 2017 Michael Harriot writer and host of The Black One podcast stated  Marijuana legalization is not just a political or legislative issue it is also about race. It is intertwined with almost every issue facing African Americans and should be front and center on black America s agenda  Police are more likely to use force against African Americans because they are more likely to stop or detain them Pot is often a contributing factor to police brutality because it gives officers the freedom to detain and arrest and search people based on nothing but suspicion  Stop and frisk is a marijuanaarrest tool An analysis of the New York City Police Department s 2012 data revealed that cops used stop and frisk to recover 729 guns but stopped 26000 and arrested 5000 people for marijuana possession. Blacks and Latinos were more likely to be stopped than whites but less likely to be found with a weapon or drugs. By 12th grade both white and black juveniles were found to have used marijuana at the same rate but underage black children were arrested for it at higher rates than their white counterparts If black children are arrested more often for marijuana the longterm effects can be dire. A drug conviction could render a student ineligible for financial aid and could pop up during employeebackground checks eliminating opportunities for employment. The disparity in sentencing affects the families of the people convicted increases the number of parents taken away from their children and trickles down into poverty and unemployment rates. Legalizing pot is not just a hotbutton political topic it is the first step in dismantling the war on drugs that has wreaked havoc on the black community for 80 years.  Michael Harriot 7 Reasons Black America Should Fight Marijuana Prohibition theroot.com Apr. 4 2017  If you have a SCIENCE IS REAL sign in your yard and you re in favor of legalizing recreational marijuana you should do some reading. The evidence emphatically disfavors legalization . The underlying menace is potency. Today s marijuana is not the Woodstock weed of bygone years 1 to 3 THC. Genetic engineering has brought plant potency above 17 and concentrates in edibles vapes and other products can approach 99.  John Hagen Follow the Science Don t Legalize Pot startribune.com Jan. 2 2023 Joe Carter Senior writer for The Gospel Coalition stated   Many have an outdated and erroneous view of the harms of marijuana. The belief that the drug is nonaddictive relatively harmless and no serious threat to individuals or society has been the rationale that s led to the legalization of marijuana in over a dozen states . Some churchgoers will still support legalization even knowing how it damages both individuals and society. But I believe many Christians who are concerned with loving their neighbor Mark 1231 will change their opinion based on the evidence. If we truly seek the welfare of the city where God has sent us into exile Jer. 297 we ll continue to oppose the legalization and normalization of this dangerous drug.  Joe Carter Why Christians Should Oppose Marijuana Legalization thegospelcoalition.org Oct. 22 2022 Peter Bensinger former administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration stated  Marijuana isn t harmless. Nor is it legal under federal law and for good reason. It contains more than 460 different chemicals and as the editorial board points out it s four to five times more powerful than the marijuana of the 1970s 80s or 90s. Extensive scientific research has documented serious harm to brain development for teenage regular users major consequences for pregnant and nursing mothers and significant impairment for drivers and others performing sensitive tasks. Colorado the first state to legalize marijuana leads the nation in use by 12to17yearolds. Meanwhile the gangs and drug dealers are cheering because their sales have skyrocketed selling to minors and others at lower prices than dispensaries can offer. Policy makers need to examine the consequences of legalization changes in teenage use traffic accidents and fatalities emergency room and treatment admissions homelessness and more.  Peter Bensinger letter to the Wall Street Journal wsj.com Jan. 2 2020 Teresa Haley State President of the NAACP Illinois stated   We believe strongly that past and current practices of the tobacco alcohol and marijuana industries prove that these industries target exploit and victimize communities of color. At a time when we are all working to bring more opportunity and advancement to our communities legalizing today s highpotency marijuana will work counter to those efforts. The vast majority of legal pot businesses are owned by wealthy white investors. Commercial marijuana is NOT social justice. It s about Big Tobacco Pharma and Wall Street investors preying on people of color and hooking them on a dangerous product for years to come. It s about putting profits ahead of people  Today s highTHC content marijuana including liquids oils and edible forms pose significant mental andphysical health risks especially for our young people  We have stood steadfast in our opposition to commercial marijuana in Michigan and New Jersey and we urge you to do the same.  Teresa Haley letter to the Speaker of the New York State Assembly and the President and Majority Leader of the New York State Senate blog.timesunion.com Mar. 13 2019 Patrick Kennedy former US Representative DRI and Kevin Sabet Director of the Drug Policy Institute at the University of Florida both CoFounders of Smart Approaches to Marijuana SAM stated  We should also recognize legalization for what it is the largescale commercialization and marketing of an addictive and therefore highly profitable substance  In states that have legalized youth marijuana use now exceeds the national average the black market continues to thrive and employers struggle with more drugimpaired workers than before pot was legalized. More heavy users of marijuana are reporting to drug treatment and there have been more school infractions among kids caught with pot. Worse still the only statistically representative national survey on marijuana use found last year that Colorado is the No. 1 state for youth marijuana use in the country. Without action the marijuana industry is poised to become the next Big Tobacco a profithungry specialinterest group looking after profits not public health. We need to acknowledge that marijuana comes with its own set of health risks including a strong link to psychosis and schizophrenia memory loss and low academic achievement.  Patrick Kennedy and Kevin Sabet Don t Let Big Marijuana Prioritize Profits over Public Safety washingtonpost.com Mar. 8 2017 Alex Berenson novelist and former New York Times reporter stated The obvious implication is that marijuana causes violence  Legalization signals that marijuana is not dangerous and encourages teen use. The states with the highest rates of youth marijuana use all allow legalized recreational sales or medical sales with very loose conditions. The United States should not legalize cannabis nationally it should move to discourage more states from legalizing and it should consider pressuring those that have already done so to reverse course.  Alex Berenson Tell Your Children The Truth About Marijuana Mental Illness and Violence 2019  Recreational marijuana is an intoxicating and addictive drug that poses serious medical risks similar to nicotine and alcohol  Cannabis use increases the risk of heart attack increases the heart rate alters blood pressure can induce an irregular heart beat increases heart stress decreases oxygen levels in the circulatory system and exacerbates angina  In my court some juveniles confessed that they burglarize homes or rob their victims in order to pay for recreational marijuana. The cost of recreational marijuana can total thousands of dollars and contributes to unnecessary financial difficulties for families. Recreational marijuana users are more likely to drop out of high school  In short the negatives far outweigh the positives and that is why recreational marijuana should not be legalized.  Joseph G. Nesser Just Say No to Legalizing Recreational Marijuana democratandchronicle.com Feb. 27 2018 The Gazette Editorial Board Colorado Springs CO stated  Five years of retail pot coincide with five years of a homelessness growth rate that ranks among the highest rates in the country. Directors of homeless shelters and people who live on the streets tell us homeless substance abusers migrate here for easy access to pot. Five years of Big Marijuana ushered in a doubling in the number of drivers involved in fatal crashes who tested positive for marijuana based on research by the prolegalization Denver Post. Five years of commercial pot have been five years of more marijuana in schools than teachers and administrators ever feared  The investigation by Education News Colorado Solutions and the INews Network found an increase in high school drug violations of 71 percent since legalization. School suspensions for drugs increased 45 percent. The National Survey on Drug Use and Health found Colorado ranks first in the country for marijuana use among teens scoring well above the national average. Commercial pot s fiveyear anniversary is an odious occasion for those who want safer streets healthier kids and less suffering associated with substance abuse.  The Gazette Editorial Board Colorado Springs CO The Sad Anniversary of Big Commercial Pot in Colorado gazette.com wrote Nov. 9 2017 Dana Stevens Executive Director of Community Action Service and Advocacy CASA stated  Articles about marijuana legalization tend to focus on income how much money will come in because of the commercialization of marijuana but rarely focus on the cost. Homelessness mental health and drug treatment are often factors on the cost side of the marijuana equation. In many communities homelessness increased after marijuana legalization. Marijuana is scientifically linked with psychosis and the onset of several other mental health issues. And in San Diego County marijuana is now the primary drug of choice among youth and almost all adults in treatment say they started with marijuana. So drug addiction treatment costs also need to be considered. Not to mention the social costs when drug users don t get treatment. Do the math marijuana commercialization income versus cost leaves communities shortchanged.  Dana Stevens letter to the editor San DiegoUnion Tribune Nov. 20 2017 The American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry AACAP stated  Marijuana legalization even if restricted to adults may be associated with a decreased adolescent perception of marijuana s harmful effects b increased marijuana use among parents and caretakers and c increased adolescent access to marijuana all of which reliably predict increased rates of adolescent marijuana use and associated problems. Marijuana use during pregnancy occurring at increasing rates raises additional concerns regarding future infant child and adolescent development  Adolescents are especially vulnerable to marijuana s many known adverse effects. One in six adolescent marijuana users develops cannabis use disorder a well characterized syndrome involving tolerance withdrawal and continued use despite significant associated impairments. Selective breeding has increased marijuana s addictive potency and potential harm to adolescents. Heavy use during adolescence is associated with increased incidence and worsened course of psychotic mood anxiety and substance use disorders.  Furthermore marijuana s deleterious effects on adolescent cognition behavior and brain development may have immediate and longterm implications including increased risk of motor vehicle accidents sexual victimization academic failure lasting decline in intelligence measures psychopathology addiction and psychosocial and occupational impairment.  Marijuanarelated policy changes including legalization may have significant unintended consequences for children and adolescents.  The American Academy of Child Adolescent Psychiatry AACAP Marijuana Legalization aacap.org May 2017 Jeff Hunt Vice President of Public Policy at Colorado Christian University stated  In the years since Colorado legalized marijuana Colorado has seen an increase in marijuana related traffic deaths poison control calls and emergency room visits. The marijuana black market has increased in Colorado not decreased. And numerous Colorado marijuana regulators have been indicted for corruption  According to the Colorado Department of Public Safety arrests in Colorado of black and Latino youth for marijuana possession have increased 58 and 29 respectively after legalization. This means that Black and Latino youth are being arrested more for marijuana possession after it became legal  The true impact of marijuana on our communities is just starting to be learned. The negative consequences of legalizing recreational marijuana will be felt for generations We ve seen the effects in our neighborhoods in Colorado and this is nothing we wish upon the nation.  Jeff Hunt Marijuana Devastated Colorado Don t Legalize it Nationally usatoday.com Aug. 7 2017  I realize this may be an unfashionable belief in a time of growing tolerance of drug use. But too many lives are at stake to worry about being fashionable. I reject the idea that America will be a better place if marijuana is sold in every corner store. And I am astonished to hear people suggest that we can solve our heroin crisis by legalizing marijuana so people can trade one lifewrecking dependency for another that s only slightly less awful. Our nation needs to say clearly once again that using drugs will destroy your life.

https://news.gallup.com/poll/514007/grassroots-support-legalizing-marijuana-hits-record.aspx, WASHINGTON D.C. Seven in 10 Americans think marijuana use should be legal the highest level yet after holding steady at 68 for three years. The latest results are based on a Gallup poll conducted Oct. 223. Aside from those in favor 29 of U.S. adults think marijuana should not be legal while 1 are unsure. Twelve percent of Americans backed legalizing marijuana when Gallup first asked about it in 1969. Support cracked the 50 threshold in 2013 jumping 10 percentage points to 58 after Colorado and Washington became the first states to legalize the recreational use of marijuana. Support has since increased by another 12 points paralleling the rise in Americans selfreported use of the drug. According to Gallup s July Consumption Habits survey the percentage saying they personally smoke marijuana has risen 10 points to 17 since 2013 and the percentage who have ever tried it has increased 12 points to 50. The July poll also found a slight majority of Americans expressing low concern about the effect of regular marijuana use on adults although they were more uneasy about the effects on young adult and teen users. For the second straight year majority support for legalization is found among all major subgroups including by age political party and ideology. Selfidentified conservatives were the last major subgroup to express majority support reaching 51 in 2022. Republicans first gave marijuana majoritylevel backing in 2017. As of today support for legal marijuana use is highest among selfidentified liberals 91 and Democrats 87 and lowest among conservatives 52 and Republicans 55. Support is inversely correlated with age reaching 79 among 18 to 34yearolds. However even among the oldest age group nearly twothirds 64 are in favor. There are no significant differences in support by gender race or education. While most of the regional differences seen this year are also not statistically significant the lower support for legalization in the East than in the West and Midwest is consistent with the recent trend. More broadly the poll finds no difference in support for legalization between residents living in the 23 states plus the District of Columbia where recreational use was already legal at the time of the poll and those living in the other 27 states that retain more restrictive laws. Seventy percent of adults in both groups are in favor. The nation has reached a broad consensus on legalizing marijuana with a full seven in 10 now supportive. Not only do most U.S. adults favor it but so do majorities of all major political and ideological subgroups. Although some health organizations and political commentators have raised concerns about the medical risks of marijuana this hasn t blunted the public s desire for legalization thus far. For now the high level of support among younger adults suggests national backing will only expand in the years ahead likely resulting in more states and perhaps the federal government moving to legalize it.
