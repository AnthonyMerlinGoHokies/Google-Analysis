But while a paycheck may bring a sense of relief satisfaction or joy it can also represent an injustice a stark reminder of persistent inequalities between men and women in the workplace. The gender pay gap stands at 20 per cent meaning women workers earn 80 per cent of what men do. For women of colour migrant women those with disabilities and women with children the gap is even greater. The cumulative effect of pay disparities has real daily negative consequences for women their families and society especially during crises. The widespread effects of COVID19 have plunged up to 95 million people into extreme poverty with one in every 10 women globally living in extreme poverty. If current trends continue 342.4 million women and girls will be living on less than 2.15 a day by 2030. Equal pay for work of equal value as defined by the ILO Equal Remuneration Convention means that all workers are entitled to receive equal remuneration not only for identical tasks but also for different work considered of equal value. This distinction is crucial because jobs held by women and men may involve varying qualifications skills responsibilities or working conditions yet hold equal value and warrant equal pay. In 2020 New Zealand passed the Equal Pay Amendment Bill ensuring that women and men are paid equally for work that s different but has equal value including in chronically underpaid femaledominated industries.  It is also important to recognize that remuneration is more than a basic wage it encompasses all the elements of earnings. This includes overtime pay bonuses travel allowances company shares insurance and other benefits. The gender pay gap originates from ingrained inequalities. Women particularly migrant women are overrepresented in the informal sector. Look around you from street vending to domestic service from coffee shop attendants to subsistence farming. Women fill informal jobs that often fall outside the domains of labour laws trapping them in lowpaying unsafe working environments without social benefits. These poor conditions for women workers perpetuate the gender pay gap. Women also do three more hours of daily care work than men globally. This includes household tasks such as cooking cleaning fetching firewood and water and taking care of children and the elderly. Although care work is the backbone of thriving families communities and economies it remains undervalued and underrecognized. Try calculating your daily load with UN Women s unpaid care calculator. The motherhood penalty exacerbates pay inequity with working mothers facing lower wages a disparity that jumps as the number of children a woman has increases. Lower wages for mothers are linked to reduced working time employment in more familyfriendly jobs that tend to be lower paying hiring and promotion decisions that penalize the careers of mothers and a lack of programmes to support women s return to work after time out of the labour market. Restrictive traditional gender roles are also spurring pay inequalities. Gender stereotypes steer women away from occupations traditionally dominated by men and push them toward carefocused work that is often regarded as unskilled or softskilled and therefore lower paid. Furthermore discriminatory hiring practices and promotion decisions that prevent women from gaining leadership roles and highly paid positions sustain the gender pay gap. Pay equity matters because it is a glaring injustice and subjects millions of women and families to lives of entrenched poverty and opportunity gaps. At the current rate we risk leaving more than 340 million women and girls in abject poverty by 2030 and an alarming 4 per cent could grapple with extreme food insecurity by that year. Women also experience significantly lower social protection coverage than men a discrepancy that largely reflects and reproduces their lower labour force participation rates higher levels of temporary and precarious work and informal employment. All these factors contribute to lower income savings and pensions of women and gendered poverty in old age. As more women are plunged into poverty the fight for equal pay and pay equity takes on a new sense of urgency because those who earn the least are most damaged by income discrepancy. In the United States Black women earn only 63.7 cents Native women 59 cents and Latinas 57 cents for every dollar that white men earn. Where money is tight lower pay can prevent women and families from putting food on the table securing safe housing and accessing critical medical care and education impacts that can perpetuate cycles of poverty across generations. It is urgent that we put female workers on equal footing as male workers. In a world on the brink of a looming care deficit women make up 67 per cent of workers providing essential health and social care services globally. Governments must address underpaid and undervalued jobs in the care sector including in education health care and social services all jobs that women predominantly occupy. Unequal pay is a stubborn and universal problem. Despite significant progress in women s education and labour market participation progress in closing the gender pay gap has been too slow. At this pace it will take almost 300 years to achieve economic gender parity. Women workers average pay is generally lower than men s in all countries and for all levels of education and age groups with women earning on average 80 per cent what men earn. Women in maledominated industries may earn more than those in femaledominated industries but the gender pay gap persists across all sectors. While gender pay gap estimates can vary substantially across regions and even within countries higher income countries tend to have lower levels of wage inequality compared to low and middleincome countries. However estimates of the gender pay gap understate the real extent of the issue particularly in developing countries because of a lack of information about informal economies which are disproportionately made up of women workers so the full picture is likely worse than what the available data shows us. Explore UN Women s report on the gender pay gap in Eastern and Southern Africa. Closing the gender pay gap requires a set of measures that push for decent work for all people. This includes measures that promote the formalization of the informal economy bringing informal workers under the umbrella of legal and effective protection and empowering them to better defend their interests. Ensuring workers right to organize and bargain collectively is an important part of the solution. Women must be involved in employer and union leadership enabling legislation that establishes comprehensive frameworks for gender equality in the workplace. Economic empowerment Chief at UN Women Dr. Jemimah Njuki says that The gender pay gap requires all stakeholders including employers governments trade unions take full responsibility and work side by side to address these challenges.

Signed into law by President John F. Kennedy on June 10 1963 this historic legislation recognized that women s work and their fair and equal treatment in the workplace is vital to our country s economic prosperity. This post highlights the significant strides in educational attainment employment and pay that have been made since the law was enacted and calls attention to gender gaps that remain in important aspects of employment. First the good news women have made great progress in the workforce since 1963. Labor force participation for primeage ages 25 to 54 women whose employment decisions are less likely to be affected by schooling and retirement grew throughout the latter half of the 20th century and the gap between their participation and that of primeage men shrunk to less than onethird of its previous size figure 1. In fact primeage women s labor force participation hit a record high in the recent May employment situation report data series began in 1948. That said the progress in primeage women s labor force participation seen in earlier decades has slowed in the 1990s and even experienced periods of decline since the 2000s. With the exception of young people in the labor force participation gaps between men and women have remained largely the same since the early 2000s. And challenges remain in ensuring equal pay for equal work. In 2022 among all wage and salary workers usually working fulltime a woman made just 83 cents for every dollar paid to a man. While the gender wage gap shrunk from 23 cents in 2000 it varies by race and ethnicity and is larger for older women. And even though women outpace men in educational attainment at all levels for those ages 25 29 the pay gap among fulltime workers exists across all levels of educational attainment figure 2. Women with postsecondary degrees face a larger penalty than the overall pay gap. One analysis found that occupational and industry segregation accounted for nearly half of the overall gender pay gap and that the relative importance of occupation and industry factors in explaining the gap rose considerably over the period of study 1980 2010. The industries with the largest share of workers who are women may also have the largest pay gaps highlighting occupational segregation s importance in persistent inequities. Notably the gender pay gap does not capture the full picture as women engage in the labor force in different ways and often have to consider their families care responsibilities alongside their employment. While measures of the gender pay gap look at fulltime yearround workers women are more likely than men to be in the labor force parttime and for part of the year. Women are also more likely to be out of the labor force for periods of time and caregivers challenges with managing work and family may lead them to cut back at work by reducing hours or turning down promotions. A recent Urban Institute report quantifies women s lifetime earnings losses from the career disruptions attached to providing care for children and elders and they are both substantial and unevenly experienced by women based on their circumstances. When family care costs are measured as a share of lifetime earnings the caregivingrelated earnings losses are particularly large for Hispanic mothers and mothers with lower levels of educational attainment. Thus the lifetime pay gap is also about the lack of accessible and affordable care infrastructure. These features of women s engagement with the workforce came to the forefront during the pandemic. Initially women s employment was particularly hard hit. In recent months however it has rebounded for primeage women and now exceeds prepandemic levels. In the initial recovery from the pandemic shock increases in women s employment were largely driven by declining unemployment but in recent months women entering the labor market has been the larger contributing factor Figure 3. What contributed to the strong employment recovery for women? A host of factors are likely responsible for women s return to the workforce including school reopenings and greater availability of early childhood schoolage and longterm care options. In addition increased remote work options may play a role. During the pandemic women were more likely to work from home than men and women are more likely than men to report that telework has made it easier for them to get their work done meet deadlines and advance in their job. Recent analysis from the Hamilton Project also suggests that industries that have experienced high job openings relative to hires since 2020 include those that disproportionately employ women such as health care and social assistance. Finally and perhaps most importantly a strong labor market is good for workers and in particular draws in those who have been historically on the margins of the labor market. In the 60 years since the passage of the Equal Pay Act there have been substantial changes in the economy that intersect with women s engagement. Some changes illuminate signs of progress while others point to lingering challenges. A continued focus on shared steady and stable economic growth including a policy environment that supports women s full engagement with the labor force will not only be better for women and their economic security but also for their families and communities and our country s continued economic growth.

https://www.gao.gov/blog/women-continue-struggle-equal-pay-and-representation, While women make up nearly half of the U.S. workforce they continue to earn less than men and remain underrepresented in management roles. Today in recognition of Equal Pay Day we look at our new report on the gender pay gap and women s representation in management. Women earn less than men even in industries where they make up most of the workforce Perhaps surprisingly some of the industries with the largest pay gaps had the greatest shares of female workers. We looked at the gender pay gap across 14 broad groups of industries and found that the pay gap was largest in the health care and social assistance industry. In these fields while women made up 77 of workers they earned 43 cents on the dollar on average compared to men. The next highest pay gap was in the financial activities industry 39 cents on average where 54 of workers were women. Conversely some of the industries with the smallest shares of female workers also had the smallest pay gaps including manufacturing and construction. Women s Estimated Average Pay for Every Dollar Earned by Men by Industry 2021 We also found that women were underrepresented in management positions in 8 of the 14 industries including 4 industries where they made up most of the workforce educational services financial activities health care and social assistance and leisure and hospitality. Across all industries while women made up 47 of workers they were only 42 of managers. The gender pay gap varies considerably by race and ethnicity and by other demographics Our new report also looked at pay for women in each racial and ethnic group compared to average pay for White men. We found wide variation in the pay gap across groups. For example compared to White male managers the pay gap for female managers ranged from 51 cents on the dollar for Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander women to 14 cents on the dollar for Asian women in 2021. Estimated Average Pay for Female Managers by Race and Ethnicity for Every Dollar Earned by White Male Managers 2021 We also found that the pay gap was larger for women who had at least one child under 18 in their household than for women who did not have children at home. And the pay gap also varied by age and marital status. We found that the pay gap was larger for women 40 and older and for women who were married among other groups. Other factors that may contribute to the gender pay gap Our new report focuses on the overall workforce and doesn t examine historic or systemic reasons for the gender pay gap. But our previous report on the federal workforce found that differences between men and women such as those in occupation education and work experience helped explain a small portion of the pay gap. The rest of the pay gap was unexplained and may be due to factors not captured in the data we analyzed such as nonfederal work experience discrimination and individual career choices among others.

https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2023/03/01/the-enduring-grip-of-the-gender-pay-gap/, There is no single explanation for why progress toward narrowing the pay gap has all but stalled in the 21st century. Women generally begin their careers closer to wage parity with men but they lose ground as they age and progress through their work lives a pattern that has remained consistent over time. The pay gap persists even though women today are more likely than men to have graduated from college. In fact the pay gap between collegeeducated women and men is not any narrower than the one between women and men who do not have a college degree. This points to the dominant role of other factors that still set women back or give men an advantage. One of these factors is parenthood. Mothers ages 25 to 44 are less likely to be in the labor force than women of the same age who do not have children at home and they tend to work fewer hours each week when employed. This can reduce the earnings of some mothers although evidence suggests the effect is either modest overall or shortlived for many. On the other hand fathers are more likely to be in the labor force and to work more hours each week than men without children at home. This is linked to an increase in the pay of fathers a phenomenon referred to as the fatherhood wage premium and tends to widen the gender pay gap. Related Gender pay gap in U.S. hasn t changed much in two decades Family needs can also influence the types of jobs women and men pursue contributing to gender segregation across occupations. Differential treatment of women including gender stereotypes and discrimination may also play a role. And the gender wage gap varies widely by race and ethnicity. Pew Research Center conducted this study to better understand how women s pay compared with men s pay in the U.S. in the economic aftermath of the COVID19 outbreak. The study is based on the analysis of monthly Current Population Survey CPS data from January 1982 to December 2022 monthly files IPUMS. The CPS is the U.S. government s official source for monthly estimates of unemployment. For a quarter of the sample each month the CPS also records data on usual hourly earnings for hourly workers and usual weekly earnings and hours worked for other workers. In this report monthly CPS files were combined to create annual files to boost sample sizes and to analyze the gender pay gap in greater detail. The comparison between women s and men s pay is based on their median hourly earnings. For workers who are not hourly workers hourly earnings were computed as the ratio of usual weekly earnings to usual weekly hours worked. The samples include employed workers ages 16 and older with positive earnings working full time or part time including those for whom earnings were imputed by the Census Bureau. Selfemployed workers are excluded because their earnings are not recorded in the CPS. The COVID19 outbreak affected data collection efforts by the U.S. government in its surveys especially in 2020 and 2021 limiting inperson data collection and affecting the response rate. It is possible that some measures of economic outcomes and how they vary across demographic groups are affected by these changes in data collection.  Mothers and fathers refer to women and men 16 and older who have an own child younger than 18 living in the household. The U.S. labor force used interchangeably with the workforce in this analysis consists of people 16 and older who are either employed or actively looking for work. White Black and Asian workers include those who report being only one race and who are not Hispanic. Hispanics are of any race. Asian workers include Pacific Islanders. Other racial and ethnic groups are included in all totals but are not shown separately.  High school graduate refers to those who have a high school diploma or its equivalent such as a General Education Development GED certificate and those who had completed 12th grade but their diploma status was unclear those who had finished 12th grade but not received a diploma are excluded. Some college include workers with an associate degree and those who attended college but did not obtain a degree. Younger women those ages 25 to 34 and early in their work lives have edged closer to wage parity with men in recent years. Starting in 2007 their earnings have consistently stood at about 90 cents to the dollar or more compared with men of the same age. But even as pay parity might appear in reach for women at the start of their careers the wage gap tends to increase as they age. Consider for example women who were ages 25 to 34 in 2010. In that year they earned 92 as much as men their age compared with 83 for women overall. But by 2022 this group of women now ages 37 to 46 earned only 84 as much as men of the same age. This pattern repeats itself for groups of women who were ages 25 to 34 in earlier years say 2005 or 2000 and it may well be the future for women entering the workforce now. A good share of the increase in the gender pay gap takes place when women are between the ages of 35 and 44. In 2022 women ages 25 to 34 earned about 92 as much as men of the same ages but women ages 35 to 44 and 45 to 54 earned 83 as much. The ratio dropped to 79 among those ages 55 to 64. This general pattern has not changed in at least four decades. The increase in the pay gap coincides with the age at which women are more likely to have children under 18 at home. In 2022 40 of employed women ages 25 to 34 had at least one child at home. The same was true for 66 of women ages 35 to 44 but for fewer 39 among women ages 45 to 54. Only 6 of employed women ages 55 to 64 had children at home in 2022. Similarly the share of employed men with children at home peaks between the ages of 35 to 44 standing at 58 in 2022. This is also when fathers tend to receive higher pay even as the pay of employed mothers in same age group is unaffected. Parenthood leads some women to put their careers on hold whether by choice or necessity but it has the opposite effect among men. In 2022 70 of mothers ages 25 to 34 had a job or were looking for one compared with 84 of women of the same age without children at home. This amounted to the withdrawal of 1.4 million younger mothers from the workforce. Moreover when they are employed younger mothers tend to put in a shorter workweek by two hours per week on average than other women their age. Reduced engagement with the workplace among younger mothers is also a longrunning phenomenon. Fathers however are more likely to hold a job or be looking for one than men who don t have children at home and this is true throughout the prime of their working years from ages 25 to 54. Among those who do have a job fathers also work a bit more each week on average than men who do not have children at home. As a result the gender gap in workplace activity is greater among those who have children at home than among those who do not. For example among those ages 35 to 44 94 of fathers are active in the workforce compared with 75 of mothers a gap of 19 percentage points. But among those with no children at home in this age group 84 of men and 78 of women are active in the workforce a gap of 6 points. These patterns contribute to the gap in workplace activity between men and women overall. As of 2022 68 of men ages 16 and older with or without children at home are either employed or seeking employment. That compares with 57 of women a difference of 11 percentage points. This gap was as wide as 24 points in 1982 but it narrowed to 14 points by 2002. Men overall also worked about three hours more per week at a job than women in 2022 on average down from a gap of about six hours per week in 1982. Parenthood affects the hourly earnings of employed women and men in unexpected ways. While employed mothers overall appear to earn less than employed women without children at home the gap is driven mainly by differences in educational attainment between the two groups. Among women with similar levels of education there is little gap in the earnings of mothers and nonmothers. However fathers earn more than other workers including other men without children at home regardless of education level. This phenomenon known as the fatherhood wage premium is one of the main ways that parenthood affects the gender pay gap among employed workers.  Motherhood does have important effects on the potential earnings of women. Women who experience breaks in their careers after becoming mothers sacrifice at least some of their earnings. Some mothers may never work for pay after having children passing on earnings altogether. But it is difficult to know what the earnings of mothers might have been and as a result it is hard to know for certain what the full effect of motherhood is on women s earnings. Estimates suggest that motherhood may account for much of the current shortfall in the earnings potential of women overall.1 Among employed men and women the impact of parenting is felt most among those ages 25 to 54 when they are most likely to have children under 18 at home. In 2022 mothers ages 25 to 34 earned 85 as much as fathers that age but women without children at home earned 97 as much as fathers. In contrast employed women ages 35 to 44 with or without children both earned about 80 as much as fathers. The table turns for women ages 45 to 54 with mothers earning more than women with no children at home. Among those ages 35 to 44 or 45 to 54 men without children earned only 84 as much as fathers.  But these patterns in the earnings of employed mothers and women with no children at home are influenced greatly by differences in education levels between the two. Among employed women ages 25 to 34 some 61 of women without children at home had a bachelor s degree or higher level of education in 2022 compared with 37 of mothers. It follows that among women ages 25 to 34 those without children at home a more highly educated group on average earned more than women with at least one child at home. Conversely employed mothers ages 45 to 54 were more likely than other women to have at least a bachelor s degree 58 vs. 42. For that reason mothers ages 45 to 54 earned more than women without children.2 When the earnings of mothers are compared with those of women without children at home who have the same level of education the differences either narrow or go away. Among employed women ages 25 to 34 with at least a bachelor s degree both mothers and women without children at home earned 80 as much as fathers in 2022. Among women ages 25 to 34 with a high school diploma and no further education mothers earned 79 as much as fathers and women with no children at home earned 84 as much. The narrowing of the gap in earnings of mothers and women without children at home after controlling for education level also extends to other age groups. Thus among the employed the effect of parenthood on the gender pay gap does not seem to be driven by a decrease in mothers earnings relative to women without children at home. Instead the widening of the pay gap with parenthood appears to be driven more by an increase in the earnings of fathers. Fathers ages 25 to 54 not only earn more than mothers the same age they also earn more than men with no children at home. Nonetheless men without children at home still earn more than women with or without children at home. Although there is little gap in the earnings of employed mothers and women with no children at home who have the same level of education there is a lingering gap in workplace engagement between the two groups. Whether they had at least a bachelor s degree or were high school graduates mothers ages 25 to 34 are less likely to hold a job or be looking for one. Similarly younger mothers on average work fewer hours than women without children at home each week regardless of their education level. The opposite is true for fathers compared with men without children at home. The share of women with at least a bachelor s degree has increased steadily since 1982 and faster than among men. In 1982 20 of employed women ages 25 and older had a bachelor s degree or higher level of education compared with 26 of employed men. By 2022 48 of employed women had at least a bachelor s degree compared with 41 of men. Still women did not see the pay gap close to the same extent from 2002 to 2022 as they did from 1982 to 2002. In part this may be linked to how the gains from going to college have changed in recent decades for women and men alike. The college wage premium the boost in earnings workers get from a college degree increased rapidly during the 1980s. But the rise in the premium slowed down over time and came to a halt around 2010. This likely reduced the relative growth in the earnings of women. Although gains in education have raised the average earnings of women and have narrowed the gender pay gap overall collegeeducated women are no closer to wage parity with their male counterparts than other women. In 2022 women with at least a bachelor s degree earned 79 as much as men who were college graduates and women who were high school graduates earned 81 as much as men with the same level of education. This underscores the challenges faced by women of all education levels in closing the pay gap. Notably the gender wage gap has closed more among workers without a fouryear college degree than among those who do have a bachelor s degree or more education. For example the wage gap for women without a high school diploma narrowed from 62 in 1982 to 83 in 2022 relative to men at the same education level. But it closed only from 69 to 79 among bachelor s degree holders over the same period. This is because only men with at least a bachelor s degree experienced positive wage growth from 1982 to 2022 all other men saw their real wages decrease. Meanwhile the real earnings of women increased regardless of their level of education. As women have improved their level of education in recent decades they ve also increased their share of employment in higherpaying occupations such as managerial business and finance legal and computer science and engineering STEM occupations. In 1982 women accounted for only 26 of employment in managerial occupations. By 2022 their share had risen to 40. Women also substantially increased their presence in social arts and media occupations. Over the same period the shares of women in several lowerpaying fields such as administrative support jobs and food preparation and serving occupations fell significantly. Even so women are still underrepresented in managerial and STEM occupations along with construction repair and production and transportation occupations when compared with their share of employment overall. And there has been virtually no change in the degree to which women are overrepresented in education health care and personal care and services occupations the last of which are lower paying than the average across all occupations. The distribution of women and men across occupations remains one of the drivers of the gender pay gap. But the degree to which this distribution is the result of personal choices or gender stereotypes is not entirely clear. Looking across racial and ethnic groups a wide gulf separates the earnings of Black and Hispanic women from the earnings of White men.3 In 2022 Black women earned 70 as much as White men and Hispanic women earned only 65 as much. The ratio for White women stood at 83 about the same as the earnings gap overall while Asian women were closer to parity with White men making 93 as much. The pay gap narrowed for all groups of women from 1982 to 2022 but more so for White women than for Black and Hispanic women. The earnings gap for Asian women narrowed by about 17 percentage points from 2002 to 2022 but data for this group is not available for 1982. To some extent the gender wage gap varies by race and ethnicity because of differences in education experience occupation and other factors that drive the gender wage gap for women overall. But researchers have uncovered new evidence of hiring discrimination against various racial and ethnic groups along with discrimination against other groups such as LGBTQ and disabled workers. Discrimination in hiring may feed into differences in earnings by shutting out workers from opportunities. Changes in the gender pay gap are also shaped by economic factors that sometimes drive men s and women s earnings in distinctive ways. Because men and women tend to work in different types of jobs and industries their earnings may respond differently to external pressures. More specifically men s earnings essentially didn t change from 1982 to 2002. Potential reasons for that include a more rapid decline in union membership among men a shift away from jobs calling for more physical skills and global competition that sharply reduced employment in manufacturing in the 1980s. At the same time women s earnings increased substantially as they raised their level of education and shifted toward higherpaying occupations. But in some ways the economic climate has proved less favorable for women this century. For reasons that are not entirely clear women s employment was slower to recover from the Great Recession of 20072009. More recently the COVID19 recession took on the moniker shecession because of the pressure on jobs disproportionately held by women. Amid a broader slowdown in earnings growth from 2000 to 2015 the increase in women s earnings from 2002 to 2022 was not much greater than the increase in men s earnings limiting the closure in the gender pay gap over the period. Higher education a shift to higherpaying occupations and more labor market experience have helped women narrow the gender pay gap since 1982. But even as women have continued to outpace men in educational attainment the pay gap has been stuck in a holding pattern since 2002 ranging from 80 to 85 cents to the dollar. More sustained progress in closing the pay gap may depend on deeper changes in societal and cultural norms and in workplace flexibility that affect how men and women balance their careers and family lives. Even in countries that have taken the lead in implementing familyfriendly policies such as Denmark parenthood continues to drive a significant wedge in the earnings of men and women. New research suggests that familyfriendly policies in the U.S. may be keeping the pay gap from closing. Gender stereotypes and discrimination though difficult to quantify also appear to be among the lastmile hurdles impeding further progress.

https://www.ncsl.org/labor-and-employment/the-gender-pay-gap, Prior to the pandemic women in the United States earned just 89 cents for every dollar made by a man. Although not equal the gender pay gap has improved markedly since 1980 when women earned 36 less than men. However the rate has remained relatively stubborn over the last 15 years. The current recession caused by the COVID19 pandemic has brought new challenges for women in the workforce and caused extensive female job losses. This webpage will review some of the existing research on the gender pay gap and explore some of the solutions states have pursued in recent years to address it. The gender pay gap can be explained in part by measurable factors such as educational attainment occupational segregation and work experience according to the Pew Research Center. Women often have less market experience than men as men are more likely to work when they have young children and more likely to work longer hours. Women are twice as likely to work in parttime jobs. Even when both men and women hold fulltime positions men are more likely to work longer hours. This overwork can result in higher pay for men. Women often take parttime work to accommodate other family duties such as caring for children or elderly family members. Studies show women are more often tasked with allocating more of their time towards unpaid labor as many of these activities have been considered women s work. One study from the Bureau of Labor Statistics BLS states that between 2003 and 2007 women worked an average of 10.8 more hours a week doing unpaid household work than men. Illustrated by the chart below the BLS breaks the unpaid work they measured out into four categories household activities caring for and helping household members purchasing goods and services and travelrelated to unpaid household work. As seen in the chart below the BLS found that women spent an average of 6.3 hours more per week doing household chores than men 15.5 versus 9.2 hours and 2.4 hours more per week providing care to household members 4.4 versus 2.0 hours. Women also on average spent more time both purchasing goods and services and traveling related to unpaid household work per week than their male counterparts. Data from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development OECD indicates that American men spend 141 minutes per day on unpaid household labor while women spend 245 minutes.  In line with this trend the pay gap is lowest at the beginning of careers and slowly increases as women s careers continue and as women are often forced to choose between paid work and family care responsibilities. This is especially true for Black women and men in part because white men attain leadership positions at higher rates than women or minorities.  The gender pay gap can be compounded for individuals with other intersecting identities such as race and class. According to data from 2020 among women who hold fulltime yearround jobs in the US Black women are typically paid 63 cents Native American women 60 cents Latinas 55 cents and Asian American women 87 cents for every dollar paid to a white male working in a similar position. Additionally Black and Hispanic women are more likely to work in lowerpaying serviceindustry jobs such as food service domestic work and health care assistance.  Finally female participation in the workforce varies greatly by industry. In 2018 the female labor force participation rate was 57.1. According to the BLS women have relatively high participation rates in education and healthcare 74 leisure and hospitality 54 and other fields such as personal and laundry 54.. In contrast women have low rates of participation in fields such as software 19 and as chief executives 27.  Note Data refer to the civilian noninstitutional population ages 15 and older. The Federal Equal Pay Act 1963 mandates equal pay for equal work among men and women. The Equal Pay Act also covers benefits bonuses and reimbursements for equal work. Since 1963 every state except for Mississippi has enacted its own version of an equal pay act. However in response to persistent pay discrepancies many states have revised or strengthened existing equal pay laws and taken additional steps to address inequitable compensation. One approach is all about pay transparency. These measures commonly contain one of three provisions 1 they prohibit employers from asking for salary history as a condition of being granted an interview or being hired 2 they require employers to publish salary ranges or 3 they allow for the disclosure of current salary and salary history among employees. Some state policies contain provisions for all three. Alabama for example passed legal protections for job applicants who choose not to disclose salary history as a condition of being granted an interview or being hired in 2019. Washington state adopted a similar policy that same year. Legislation passed in Hawaii in 2018 both prohibits employers from asking for salary history up front and prohibits employers from taking discriminatory actions against employees for discussing wages with other workers. Maryland s most recent amendment to it s Equal Pay Act took effect in October 2020. According to the Society for Human Resource Management the bill requires employers to provide applicants upon request with a wage salary range for a potential position. The bill also creates a ban on disclosure of pay history and protects employees who make inquiries about their own wages.  Recognizing and accounting for other intersecting identities in equal pay laws is another approach taken by states to address continued pay inequities. In 2017 California amended its Equal Pay Act to prohibit pay discrimination against minorities. The amendment prevents employers from using prior pay history to justify a sex race or ethnicitybased pay difference. Illinois amendments to it s Equal Pay Act took effect in September 2019. The amendments like other states prohibit inquiries into salary history and protect employee disclosure or inquiry into wages. The recently amended version of the Act also specifically states that in addition to gender no employer may pay wages to AfricanAmerican employees at a rate less than what they pay an employee who is not AfricanAmerican for the same work. Finally New York s Equal Pay Act requires that all employees in one or more protected classes be paid the same as an employee not in a protected class doing similar work. Protected classes are defined in statute to include age race color national origin sexual orientation military status and disability among others.  Multiple states also passed laws which broaden the definition of equal or comparable work and implement consequences for violating these laws. Maine amended it s Equal Pay Act in 2019. Similar to other state laws the Act prohibits unequal pay for equal work. Specifically the Act mandates equal pay for both sexes for comparable work on jobs which have comparable requirements relating to skill effort and responsibility. Finally the Maine law also protects employees who take action to assist in the enforcement of equal pay. A substantial law the Nebraska Equal Pay Act also prohibits unequal pay for comparable work. The Act states that employers cannot lower one person s salary in order to comply with the equal pay requirement. Similar to the Maine law the Act prohibits the discipline or discharge of an employee who takes action to enforce the provisions of the Act. The Act also establishes the powers of the Nebraska Equal Opportunity Commission.  Finally some states enacted laws which provide a more unique set of protections. Nevada N.R.S. 333.182188 effective 6302021 requires the state Purchasing Division to only engage with vendors who have submitted a bid or proposal for a state contract that pays their employees equal pay for equal work without regard to gender. The State s Purchasing Division is required to establish a program to independently certify vendors that pay their employees equal pay for equal work. The amendment to the Wyoming Equal Pay Act places significant consequences on companies which do not adhere to equal pay laws by increasing penalties for violations of the Act. Employers who violate the Act face fines up to 500 and imprisonment up to six months. Finally Colorado s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act SB 19085 restructures the state s existing complaint management system for equal pay claims. The state authorizes the director of labor and employment to create a complaint mediation process including providing legal resources to claimants. The act prohibits wage differentials based on wage rate history or sex but allows for disparities based on seniority and a number of other exceptions. The law enables the state to enforce employer pay transparency through levying fines against employers between 500 and 10000 for violations.  So far this year states are continuing to consider legislation similar above. In Alaska SB 16 would task the state with studying and reporting on equal pay for comparable work and is currently under consideration. The bill would require the State Commission for Human Rights to submit a report to the legislature annually including information regarding what extent employees are paid equal pay for equal work regardless of characteristics including race religion national origin age physical or mental disability sex and others. Iowa s legislature is currently considering a bill that would impact pay equity in a number of ways. First it would follow what other states have done in making it illegal for an employer to seek salary history as a condition of an interview or employment. The bill would also make it illegal for employers to require employees to refrain from discussing salary as a condition of employment. Finally the legislation would also establish an Equal Pay Task Force charged with studying the extent to which the gender pay gap persists in the state and why. In South Carolina a bill is under consideration that would amend that state s Equal Pay Act. Similar to action other states have taken the legislation adds to the state s existing equal pay statutes by elaborating on what is considered comparable work and comparable jobs. The bill also elaborates on the administrative and judicial consequences employers would face if found in violation of these laws. Finally the Mississippi Legislature is considering equal pay legislation related to state employees and contractors this legislative session. Mississippi SB 2330 if passed would prohibit the state or any of its political subdivisions from paying employees at wage rates less than those paid to employees of another sex for the same work. The bill does allow for wage differentials when based upon specific factors such as tenure.  Although data collection on the effects of COVID19 on women in the workplace and the gender pay gap are ongoing it is clear that the pandemicrelated recession has disproportionately affected women. In previous recessions such as in 2008 men reported higher rates of job losses than women. According to a report by the National Bureau of Economic Research NBER men are more likely to work in fields affected by a typical recession. In contrast women are more likely to work in relatively stable fields such as healthcare and education. The unique nature of a pandemic related recession has reversed these effects however.  As the female labor force participation by industry data show women are much more likely to work in hospitality healthcare and education. While hospitality healthcare and education are normally stable industries they have been some of the hardest hit during the pandemicrelated recession. Fittingly the BBC has deemed the current economic downturn a shecession noting that female job losses are 1.8 times greater than male losses. A report by the McKinsey Global Institute claims that women accounted for 46 of the prepandemic labor force but account for 54 of recent job losses. The report states that globally women are 19 more at risk of losing their jobs due to COVID19. Overall labor market distribution accounts for 25 of the gender gap in job losses. McKinsey along with other sources claim that another reason for high female job losses is because women do about 75 of existing unpaid work and may have been overly burdened by increasing childcare needs due to the pandemic. Furthermore cultural ideas about the value of keeping a job vary for men and women. This means that when jobs are scarce or domestic needs are high women may be more likely to give up their jobs than men. Overall McKinsey estimates that the failure to address these gender disparities could result in a 1 trillion lower global GDP in 2030 than if the pandemic had not occurred.  While current data on the effects of the recession on the gender pay gap are inconclusive some sources claim that there may be longterm effects caused by the disproportionate job losses experienced by women. The BLS published data on the median weekly pay differential between women and men in the first three quarters of 2020. The data are as follows A more comprehensive chart including information on minority women is available on the BLS website.  While evidence of an immediate gender pay gap change is inconclusive the Society for Human Resource Management SHRM indicates that there could be a longerterm pay differential. The SHRM claims that women often incur a pay penalty after taking a long period of time off of work and earn 7 less on average than men in the same position. Due to the pandemic women are more likely to take time off of work to care for children thus presenting the potential for a widening pay gap.
